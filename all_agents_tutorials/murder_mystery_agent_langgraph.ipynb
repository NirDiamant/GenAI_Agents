        "# Murder Mystery Game with LLM Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates how to create a game environment featuring autonomous LLM agents that take part in the game, using LangGraph, a framework for creating workflows with language models. The project produces a game that can be played by either a human or an LLM Agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "Creating autonomous agents that interact with a game environment has always been a topic of great interest, and now, we can utilize LLMs as the agents. This kind of work is also interesting from a robotics perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Murder Mystery Game Description\n",
        "\"Murder Mystery\" is an interactive text-based detective game powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this engaging experience, a human player steps into the shoes of Sherlock Holmes to solve procedurally generated murder mysteries. The game creates unique scenarios each time you play.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Inspiration\n",
        "\"Murder Mystery\" is an interactive detective game inspired by the recent paper \"UNBOUNDED: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation\" (Li et al., 2024). While UNBOUNDED introduced the concept of generative infinite games through character life simulation, we adapt their core principles to create an engaging murder mystery experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like UNBOUNDED, our game leverages large language models and generative AI to create dynamic, open-ended gameplay that transcends traditional hard-coded game mechanics. Whereas UNBOUNDED allows players to interact with autonomous virtual characters across various environments, our game applies similar technical principles to enable players to step into Sherlock Holmes' shoes and solve procedurally generated murder mysteries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We wanted to make a tutorial for including LLM Agents inside game environments. Prior to creating this tutorial, we couldn't find a good resource that explains how to achieve this, so we made this tutorial! Additionally, we couldn't find projects that use LLM Agents inside games implemented with LangGraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "We use two LangGraphs to build the infinite game mechanics for Murder Mystery Agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Game Loop Graph: This is the main Graph which orchestrates the game creation and game loop. This Graph is responsible for:\n",
        "   * Creating the game characters/NPCs\n",
        "   * Creating the storyline\n",
        "   * Introducing the Players/Users to the game\n",
        "   * Game Mechanics of Character Interviews (through Conversation Sub Graph) and Guessing the Killer\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Conversation Sub-graph: This is the Sub Graph which orchestrates the Infinite Conversation Mechanics of the game. This graph allows the Players/Users to interview the different Characters in the game to identify the Killer. The Graph also supports a Sherlock AI assistant that can automate the interview process and assist the Players/Users with their investigation. The Sherlock AI assistant has access to Clues which can aid the Players with their investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two Graphs together form the complete game mechanics of Murder Mystery Agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have also used display functions which contain basic game logic (which can also be standalone functions). These display functions are responsible for creating a basic UI for the game and allow Players/Users to experience the game in this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "1. State Management: Utilizes `GenerateGameState`, `ConversationState` classes to manage the game state and the textual conversation state\n",
        "2. Language Model: Employs ChatOpenAI (GPT-4o) for the backstory generation, interactable characters, and (optionally) the LLM investigator protagonist agent\n",
        "3. Gameplay Features:\n",
        "   * LLM generated character backstory and story\n",
        "   * Talk with LLM Agent characters (Human/Sherlock LLM Agent)\n",
        "   * Pick the killer\n",
        "4. Interactive UI\n",
        "5. LangGraph Workflow: Orchestrates the composition process using 2 state graphs:\n",
        "   * Conversation sub-graph\n",
        "   * Game Loop graph\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method\n",
        "The system has 2 main phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Game Setup:\n",
        "1. User inputs an initial environment string (e.g., \"Urban city\"), amount of players, and the number of guesses the investigator can make\n",
        "2. Plot and character backstory generated by an LLM\n",
        "3. One character is set as the murderer and the others are innocent\n",
        "\n",
        "Game Loop:\n",
        "Human/LLM Agent acts as the investigator. It can make 2 actions: talk to characters in the scene and guess which of the characters is the killer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Talking to characters maintains a conversation with an LLM Agent with memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The entire process is orchestrated using LangGraph, which manages the flow of information between different components and ensures that each step builds upon the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A Beginner Friendly Understanding of our Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a step by step guide to our thought process as we built Murder Mystery Agent, it is similar to directing a 'Play':\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Setting the Stage\n",
        "* First, you decide on your story's world - it could be anywhere from a bustling office to a mystical forest\n",
        "* Choose how many characters will populate your story\n",
        "* Determine how challenging you want the mystery to be by setting the number of guesses\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Creating the Cast\n",
        "* Rather than writing every character's background yourself, we let AI create rich, interconnected characters\n",
        "* Each character has their own personality, motives, and relationship to the story\n",
        "* One character becomes the victim, another the killer, while others become suspects\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Writing the Story\n",
        "* The AI weaves together a unique murder mystery incorporating your setting and characters\n",
        "* Every story element is connected, making the mystery solvable through careful investigation\n",
        "* Each playthrough creates a completely new narrative\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Designing Interactions\n",
        "* Players need ways to investigate - like interviewing suspects or examining evidence\n",
        "* The game tracks these interactions, remembering what each character has said\n",
        "* Players can either ask their own questions or get help from SherlockAI\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Making it Dynamic\n",
        "* The conversation system allows for natural back-and-forth dialogue\n",
        "* Characters remember previous interactions and maintain consistent stories\n",
        "* This creates an immersive experience where every question could lead to a vital clue\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Player Experience\n",
        "* A clean, intuitive interface helps players focus on solving the mystery\n",
        "* Clear feedback shows players how their investigation is progressing\n",
        "* The game guides players while still leaving room for deduction and reasoning\n",
        "\n",
        "The beauty of this system is that it combines human creativity (in designing the framework) with AI capabilities (in creating unique content) to produce an endless variety of mysteries. Each game is different, but all follow the same core principles of good detective fiction - observation, deduction, and the thrill of discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "This modular approach means you can easily modify any aspect without breaking the others. Want more suspects? Just adjust the character count. Prefer a different setting? Simply change the environment. The system adapts while maintaining the core mystery-solving experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the great potential LLM agents can have in a game, either by utilizing their rich text generation abilities or making them play an active role in a dynamic system. This can be used to make compelling NPC AI, for example."
