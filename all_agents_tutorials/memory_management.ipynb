    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a workflow-based memory management system that combines LangGraph and GPT-4 mini to update existing memories based on new interactions. The system takes previously generated memories and uses a graph-based workflow to identify relevant memories that need updating, then modifies them while maintaining their hierarchical organization (type → label → content → context). This approach ensures that memories evolve coherently as new information becomes available."
