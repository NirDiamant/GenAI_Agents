It depicts a seemingly disheartened swagman, sitting by a campfire sadly brooding over his misfortune. According to an 1889 review, \"The face tells of hardships, keen and blighting in their influence, but there is a nonchalant and slightly cynical expression, which proclaims the absence of all self-pity ... McCubbin's picture is thoroughly Australian in spirit.\" The surrounding bush is painted in subdued tones, reflecting his somber and contemplative mood.\r The artist's model was Louis Abrahams, a friend and successful tobaccanist in Melbourne who earlier supplied the cigar box lids for the famous 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition. The scene was staged near the Box Hill artists' camp outside Melbourne, but it is thought that McCubbin would have made additional studies of Abrahams under studio conditions.\r The painting was owned by William Fergusson up to 1986 until it was purchased by the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth.\n", "\nArtist: Frederick McCubbin\nArtwork Name: The pioneer\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/the-pioneer-1904\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Pioneer is a 1904 painting by Australian artist Frederick McCubbin. The painting is a triptych; the three panels tell a story of a free selector and his family making a life in the Australian bush. It is widely considered one of the masterpieces of Australian art.\r The painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection and exhibited in the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square in Melbourne.\r The three panels of the triptych tell a story of a free selector, a farmer who has chosen some land to clear and farm, and his family. The story is ambiguous, like many of McCubbin's other works and McCubbin chose not to respond when controversy broke out over the \"correct\" meaning.\r The left panel shows the selector and his wife settling on their selection; in the foreground the woman is deep in thought. In the centre panel, the baby in the woman's arms indicates that some time has elapsed. A cottage, the family home, can be seen in a clearing through the trees. The right panel shows a young man standing over a grave. A city is visible in the background, again indicating that time has passed. It is unclear if the young man is the baby from the centre panel or a stranger stumbling across the grave.\r McCubbin painted the work en plein air near Fontainebleau \u2014 his home in Mount Macedon, northwest of Melbourne \u2014 using specially dug trenches to lower the canvas. The view is across a neighbouring property owned by William Peter McGregor, the second chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd. The cottage in the middle panel was the home of the manager of McGregor's bull stud. McCubbin's wife Annie and a local sawyer Patrick \"Paddy\" Watson were the models for the left panel, with Watson also the model for the youth in the right panel. The model for the centre panel was a young commercial painter, James Edward with Annie again posing as the woman. The baby was Jimmy Watson, Patrick's nephew.\r A study of the materials and technique used in the painting revealed that\u2014to add \"luminosity and texture\"\u2014McCubbin covered the ground in the centre panel with a further layer of lead white; the brushmarks in the stiffer lead white can be seen through the later layers in raking light. Raking light also shows that a palette knife has been used in some places to apply paint to the surface. The painting is still displayed in its original frame; the frame may have been resurfaced.\r The painting was first exhibited in a one-man show in 1904 at the Melbourne Athenaeum gallery but did not find a buyer. Walter Withers, a friend of McCubbin's, suggested that McCubbin add a view of Melbourne in the background of the right panel, which he did. The National Gallery of Victoria purchased the painting the following year for 367 pounds and 10 shillings, using funds from the Felton Bequest.\r The painting has been described as \"self-consciously nationalistic; proud of the prosperity of the fine city seen in the background - Its mood of quiet optimism is unqualified.\"\n", "\nArtist: Tom Roberts\nArtwork Name: The Golden Fleece\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-roberts/the-golden-fleece-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Golden Fleece, originally known as Shearing at Newstead, is an 1894 painting by the Australian artist Tom Roberts.

The same shed is depicted in another of Roberts' works, Shearing Shed, Newstead (1894).\r The painting was originally titled Shearing at Newstead but was renamed The Golden Fleece after the Golden Fleece of Greek mythology to honour the wool industry and the nobility of the shearers.

Painted in a post-impressionist manner, it is set in a quiet backstreet off the Calle Larga dei Proverbi, near the Grand Canal in Venice. The painting shows a young woman walking along the flagstones, kicking her skirt with her right foot, and observed by two men in the shadows to her right. From the manner in which Sargent depicts her down-turned eyes and seemingly fast pace with which she passes the two men, he is concerned largely with the invasive male glare and its effect on the passing woman.\r The painting is one of a number of Venetian scenes painted or drawn by Sargent, who spent most of his life in Europe, during his time in the city. As in his other works, it largely ignores the architectural aspects the city is best known for and focuses instead on edgy back-street imagery. The influence of Impressionism is evident in a number of this work's features, especially in the broad brush strokes of her dress and the unusual cropping of the composition.\r The woman is observed by two intimidating, darkly coloured men huddled in conversation to the right of the frame. In the middle background a couple are seated outside of a cafe or bar, also deep in conversation. The couple are interested only in themselves, in contrast to the two men. Their gaze follows the girl, while her downcast eyes deliberately avoid their attention. Her shawl and skirt hem are shown flowing, suggesting that she is moving quickly past them. The Venice setting is significant; the artist has placed the moment away from the cosmopolitan surroundings of London, Paris or New York\u00a0\u2013 cities more familiar to him and which he considered more refined.\r In composition and mood, the painting has been linked by the writer Margaret Conrads to the earlier Crossing the Street by Giovanni Boldini, who lived in Venice during 1880. Similar to Sargent's other Venetian scenes, the street is mostly darkened, the peripheral figures in shadow, while light spills on the buildings from the distance.\r In its use of broad dark areas silhouetted against lighter ground used to give shape to the figures, it seems influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez. That Sargent was influenced by photography of Venice, in particular by the works of Carlo Naya (1816\u20131882), can be seen the way the painting is closely cropped, and in the almost photographic freeze-frame capturing of movement in a moment in time.\r The painting is composed as a series of descending rectangles arranged in a near-telescopic manner, outside of which a section of blue sky lightens the claustrophobic tone marked by the descending angles which meet at the girl's head. It is largely rendered in monochrome, though there are touches of red in the girl's head comb, dress and in the cafe behind her. However, overall the artist is more concerned with tone than colour.\r Street in Venice was first exhibited in 1882 at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris. It was purchased by Elizabeth Chanler of Boston in 1888, who gave it to the American architect Stanford White in return for professional services. In 1962, the painting was acquired by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, where it is on permanent display.\n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: Reapers Resting in a Wheat Field\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/reapers-resting-in-a-wheat-field-1885\n\nWikipedia Article:\nReapers Resting in a Wheat Field is a late 19th-century painting by American impressionist John Singer Sargent. Done in oil on canvas, the painting a scene set in a wheat field near the village of Broadway, Worcestershire.  The painting depicts a group of English wheat farmers resting in their field during harvest. The titular reapers are seated in a semicircle, with their sickles stuck in the ground. As is evident by the stacks of wheat in the field, the harvest is well underway. The sky in the background is slightly overcast, while a brace of trees provides a stark, green backdrop that contrasts the yellow field of wheat. Aspects of the painting consist of long, wavy brushstrokes, a style in tune with Sagent's impressionist proclivities.  Sargent spent the fall of 1885 in the Cotswolds of Southern England, where the image was painted.  \n", "\nArtist: John Singer Sargent\nArtwork Name: Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,lithography,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/carnation-lily-lily-rose-from-the-world-s-greatest-paintings-published-by-oldham-s-press-in-1886\n\nWikipedia Article:\nCarnation, Lily, Lily, Rose is an oil-on-canvas painting made by the Anglo-American painter John Singer Sargent in 1885-6.\r The painting depicts two small children dressed in white who are lighting paper lanterns as day turns to evening; they are in a garden strewn with pink roses, accents of yellow carnations and tall white lilies (possibly the Japanese mountain lily, Lilium auratum) behind them. The painting is dominated by green foliage, with no horizon or other horizontal line to give a sense of depth. The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them. The two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard \u2013 a friend of Sargent's. Dolly, left, was 11 years-old and Polly, right, 7 years-old; they were chosen for their blonde hair, replacing Sargent's original model, Francis Davis Millet's 5-year-old daughter, dark-haired Katherine. The title comes from the refrain of a popular song \"Ye Shepherds Tell Me\" by Joseph Mazzinghi, a pastoral glee for a trio of male voices, which mentions Flora wearing \"A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose\".\r The work is set in an English garden at Farnham House in Broadway in the Cotswolds, where Sargent spent the summer of 1885 with Millet shortly after moving to England from Paris to escape the scandal caused by his 1884 painting Portrait of Madame X. Sargent took inspiration from the lanterns that he saw hanging among trees and lilies while boating on the River Thames at Pangbourne with American artist Edwin Austin Abbey in September 1885. Sargent wanted to capture the exact level of light at dusk so he painted the picture en plein air \u2013 outdoors and in the Impressionist manner. Every day from September to November 1885, he painted in the few minutes when the light was perfect, giving the picture an overall purple tint of evening. The flowers in the garden died as summer turned to autumn, and they were replaced with artificial flowers. Sargent resumed painting the following summer at Millet's new home nearby in Broadway and finally finished the painting by the end of October 1886. In the course of working, Sargent cut down the rectangular canvas, removing approximately 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) from the left side, to leave an approximately square shape.\r The work received a mixed reception at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1887, with some criticising his \"Frenchified\" style. However, there was also much praise, and Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, encouraged the Tate Gallery to buy the painting later that year, using money from the Chantrey Bequest. It was the first of Sargent's works to be acquired by a public museum. The painting remains part of the Tate collection and is displayed at Tate Britain.\n", "\nArtist: Childe Hassam\nArtwork Name: The Avenue in the Rain\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/childe-hassam/the-avenue-in-the-rain\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Avenue in the Rain is a 1917 oil painting by the American painter Childe Hassam. The Impressionist work depicts Fifth Avenue in New York City in the rain, festooned with US flags. The painting is one of six works by Hassam in the permanent art collection of the White House in Washington DC.\r Between 1916 and 1919, Childe Hassam painted around 30 paintings of streets decorated with flags. This work was painted in February 1917, shortly before the US joined the First World War, at a time when patriotic fervour was rising in the US. The previous month, Germany extended its unrestricted submarine warfare to neutral ships, including vessels bearing the US flag. The Zimmermann Telegram became public knowledge at the end of February 1917, and the US declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917.\r The painting measures 42 by 22.25 inches (106.7\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a056.5\u00a0cm). It has dominant tones of red and blue, with whites for the stars and stripes; several dark figures in the middle distance are holding umbrellas, and those further away fade into the blue background. The flags seem to float in mid-air, flying from flagpoles that project out from the buildings on the street, but the buildings are not visible. The flags and human figures are reflected on the wet street and sidewalk. Childe Hassam may have been influenced by two similar works of Claude Monet depicting national celebrations in Paris on 30 June 1878.\r It was donated to the White House in 1963 by Thomas Mellon Evans. It was hung between the windows in John F. Kennedy's blue-themed President's Bedroom (now a private sitting room, adjacent to the Yellow Oval Room on the second floor of the White House), and then was in the President's Dining Room for many years. It was hung in the Oval Office by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n", "\nArtist: Richard Jack\nArtwork Name: Battle of Vimy Ridge\nArtwork Genre: battle painting\nArtwork Media: print\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-jack/battle-of-vimy-ridge-1918\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a military engagement fought primarily as part of the Battle of Arras, in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, during the First World War. The main combatants were the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in the First Army, against three divisions of the German 6th Army. The battle, which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the Battle of Arras, the first attack of the Nivelle Offensive, intended to attract German reserves from the French front.\r The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Th\u00e9lus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy\u2013M\u00e9ricourt line.\r Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation, meticulous planning, powerful artillery support and extensive training, as well as the failure of the German 6th Army properly to apply the new German defensive doctrine. The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice. A 100-hectare (250-acre) portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial.\r Vimy Ridge is an escarpment 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plain. The ridge rises gradually on its western side and drops more quickly on the eastern side. At approximately 7\u00a0km (4.3\u00a0mi) in length and culminating at an elevation of 145\u00a0m (476\u00a0ft) or 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) above the Douai Plains, the ridge provides a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.\r The ridge fell under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture the height of the ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Young Spartans Exercising\nArtwork Genre: history painting\nArtwork Media: board,canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/young-spartans-exercising-1860-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nYoung Spartans Exercising, also known as Young Spartans and also as Young Spartan Girls Challenging Boys, is an early oil on canvas painting by French impressionist artist Edgar Degas. The work depicts two groups of male and female Spartan youth exercising and challenging each other in some way. The work is now in the permanent collection of the National Gallery in London.\r The painting depicts as its subject matter two groups of older children, four girls and five boys, with the girls apparently taunting or beckoning the boys. The girls are positioned to the left of the painting, the boys to the right, while in-between the two groups in the background appear a third group watching them; their appearance striking as they are fully dressed while the youth in the foreground stand naked or topless. Behind the onlookers, identified as Lycurgus and the mothers of the children, lies the city of Sparta, dominated by Mount Taygetus, from which the bodies of the society's \"unfit\" children were supposedly thrown into a ravine, to die from trauma or exposure.\r The painting was begun in 1860 with Degas returning to the canvas to rework the piece over the following years, though it remained unfinished upon the artist's death. X-rays taken of the work during the early 21st century have revealed that Degas changed the positioning of the youths, their faces, and even their number; this last change resulted in the strange image of the four women in the foreground having ten legs among them. Degas' revisitation of the faces of the young people is often mentioned in art criticism, as it is believed the artist changed the features of the youths from the classic handsome Greek ideal, to a more urban modernistic look. The French art historian Andr\u00e9 Lemoisne, was first to note on this fact, remarking that the subjects had a contemporary Parisian look, more akin to the \"gamins of Montmartre\". More recent critics agree with Lemoisne, believing Degas was attempting to \"update\" his painting.\r A second full-scale version of the painting exists, held by the Art Institute of Chicago. This version is much less finished, but it shows a vastly different background, with a more detailed landscape and a large architectural structure, around which the characters in the background are resting. The work also shows how Degas changed the number of foreground figures with an additional boy on the right of the painting.\r Young Spartans Exercising was purchased by the National Gallery in 1924 and, as of late 2013, is displayed in Room 41.\r In 1879, Italian art critic Diego Martelli described the unfinished work as \"one of the most classicizing paintings imaginable\"; though after Martelli's remarks, Degas returned to the painting and removed the classicizing architecture.\r In a 1985 edition of The Art Bulletin, art critic Carol Salus hypothesises that the work \"... has traditionally been interpreted as representing young women challenging young men to wrestle or race, is instead a presentation of Spartan courtship rites\". This position was challenged in the same publication the following year, with Linda Nochlin arguing that the work could encompass a variety of meanings, and by referring to Degas' own reluctance to explain the work in any great detail, allows the viewer to interpret the work to their own merit. This view is echoed by Christopher Riopelle, curator of 19th-century painting at the National Gallery, who in 2004 stated that the painting, \"...starts as a traditional historical painting, closely based on classical accounts and meticulous research. It ends as something much more enigmatic.\"\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Comte Le Pic and his Sons\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/comte-le-pic-and-his-sons\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLudovic Lepic and His Daughters (French: Ludovic Lepic et ses filles) is a painting by Edgar Degas that was completed around 1871.

In it, Degas depicts his uncle Michel Musson's cotton brokerage business (which several years later went bankrupt in an economic crash, according to Michael McMahon of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette when the firm was swamped by the postwar growth of the much larger Cotton Exchange). In the painting, Musson is seen examining raw cotton for its quality while Degas' brother Rene reads The Daily Picayune. Another brother, Achille, rests against a window wall at left while others, including Musson's partners, go about their business.\r A Cotton Office in New Orleans was the first painting by Degas to be purchased by a museum, and the first by an Impressionist. Degas' sale of the piece marked a turning point in his career as he moved from being a struggling, unrecognized artist to a recognized and financially stable artist, according to Marilyn Brown in her book Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans.\r Degas traveled from Europe to New Orleans in late 1872 with his brother, Ren\u00e9, to visit his mother's brother, Michael Musson. After the American Civil War, Ren\u00e9 had joined his uncle's cotton business in New Orleans. Degas was to return to Europe in January 1873, but when his return trip was delayed, he was asked by his relatives to paint their portraits, and decided to show them as a group, at work in the family office.\r Degas crafted his work with the intent of selling it to a British textile manufacturer. But a drop in stock prices worldwide and declines in the cotton and art markets ended his hopes for that specific sale. Degas then exhibited A Cotton Office in New Orleans in the second Impressionist show in Paris in 1876. Degas finally sold the painting in 1878 to the newly founded Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau, France.\r The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as The Cotton Exchange at New Orleans, referring to the historic New Orleans Cotton Exchange.\n", "\nArtist: Edgar Degas\nArtwork Name: Place de la Concorde\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/place-de-la-concorde-1875\n\nWikipedia Article:\nPlace de la Concorde or Viscount Lepic and his Daughters Crossing the Place de la Concorde is an 1876 oil painting by Edgar Degas.

Completed in about 1879, the painting was already in the collection of the French banker Ernest May when it was listed in the catalogue of the fourth Impressionist exhibition that year. It may also have been shown in the next Impressionist exhibit in 1880, but it was not well known until it entered the collections of the Louvre in 1923. The canvas shows an interior corner of the open trading floor of the Paris Stock Exchange (The Paris Bourse). May stands in the centre of the picture wearing a top hat and pince-nez, listening to his colleague, a certain M. Bol\u00e2tre, leaning over his shoulder. They are likely discussing a document, possibly a bordereau, held aloft by a partially obscured third party.\r Although the owner and possible commissioner of the work was himself Jewish, art historian Linda Nochlin has interpreted the painting as an anti-Semitic depiction of Jews in Paris, due especially to the exaggerated features and postures of the subjects. British art historian Richard Shone has written about the oil painting and its pastel study without mentioning anti-Semitism. In stark contrast to Nochlin, he describes the figures as having \"humdrum features.\" May himself, according to Shone, is depicted as a \"seasoned figure\" whose \"expression gives nothing away.\"  While anti-Semitism has a long history in France, there is little evidence of Degas' holding this attitude until the time of the Dreyfus affair two decades later.\r The technique of Portraits at the Stock Exchange can be more closely related to Impressionism than many of Degas's earlier works. Evidence for this can be found in the painting's quickly applied, sketchy brushstrokes. The psychological perspective of the painting is one of detachment, a common viewpoint in Impressionist paintings. This painting currently resides in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.

It is in The Walters Art Museum collection.\r Alfred Sisley can be distinguished from other Impressionists by his commitment to landscape painting. In 1872, he moved his family to Louveciennes, where he painted the nearby view of the Seine Vally at St.-Germain-en-Laye. Over the course of his career he painted nearly 900 oil paintings, which were mainly landscapes spanning from the forest of Fontainebleau and Louveciennes, London to Moret and Wales. He would often focus on the serenity of pastoral settings.\r The Terrace at Saint-Germain, Spring represents a panoramic view of the Seine Valley and captures the light associated with Springtime. The painting portrays a seemingly limitless area of countryside. The river is shown winding away from Paris, in the foreground, laborers work in a vineyard and a lone female walks through the orchard. In the distance, there is a chateau, which housed the royal court until 1682.

It depicts a young Jewish woman, Rebecca Cl\u00e9mentine Stora, in Algerian costume and is untypical of Renoir's work, leading to debate about the place of the painting within his oeuvre. Renoir and Stora both later repudiated the work.\r Pierre-Auguste Renoir was closely associated with the Impressionist movement and the painting of modern life in France in the mid-nineteenth century. L'Alg\u00e9rienne is untypical of his output in depicting a named living subject in an oriental costume. Renoir did create a number of Orientalist works including Woman of Algiers (\"Odalisque\") (1870) and Parisian Women in Algerian Costume (The Harem) (1872), however, both were homages to existing works rather than portraits of living people, Ingres' Grande Odalisque (1814, Louvre) in the first case and Delacroix's Women of Algiers in their Apartment (1834, Louvre) in the second. Renoir did not travel abroad until 1881 when he visited Algeria.\r L'Alg\u00e9rienne has been described by Colin Bailey as \"proto-Impressionist\". The broad brush strokes and exuberant use of colour represent a high point in Renoir's temporary rejection of the realism of Gustave Courbet and Eduard Manet in favour of the influence of his hero Delacroix. Later, when his style had changed considerably, Renoir repudiated the work, complaining in connection with it, \"la manie des amateurs de toujours demander ma mani\u00e8re ancienne\".\r The painting depicts a young Sephardic Jewish woman, Rebecca Cl\u00e9mentine Stora, n\u00e9e Valensi (or Valensin), in Algerian costume. Cl\u00e9mentine Valensi was born in Algiers on 24 April 1851 and died in July 1917. She was the daughter of a maker of travel goods. The Stora and Valensi families moved to Paris in the late 1860s when there was growing anti-Semitic feeling in their native Algeria. Cl\u00e9mentine married Nathan Stora in Paris in 1868. He was an antiques dealer who specialised in goods from North Africa and had a shop at 24 Boulevard des Italiens named Au Pacha which later moved to the fashionable boulevard Hausmann. The tourist trade with French Algeria created a strong market for Algerian and North African themed material in France and the business claimed to be suppliers to the Government General of Algeria.\r Research using contemporary photographs has shown that the costume worn by Cl\u00e9mentine in the picture is authentic for a Jewish Algerian woman of her era. Comparisons have also been made with Charles Cordier's bust The Jewish Woman of Algiers, which was shown at the Salon of 1863 and the Exposition Universelle of 1867, and which depicts a woman in a similar costume. The costume was not, however, conventional for 1870's Paris and it is unclear whether the choice of an Algerian theme was an attempt at ethnic authenticity by Renoir or a demand of the Storas. Cl\u00e9mentine's pursed expression seems to indicate that she is not entirely happy with something. If it was the costume, that did not stop her depiction in similar form in 1877 by Brochart. The authenticity of the clothes and the fact that the painting is a portrait of a named living person rules out the idea that the picture is a work of oriental fantasy and places it more in the realm of conventional portraiture, however, questions remain about what Renoir and the Storas were trying to achieve in the work.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Mother and children\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: None\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/mother-and-children\n\nWikipedia Article:\nMother and Children (also known as La Promenade) is an Impressionist painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir that is housed in the Frick Collection.

Renoir\u2019s emphasis moves away from the human figure and towards how lighting affects the image. The painting shows the clothes worn by the people on the boulevard in detail, from which their social class can be inferred, but their individuality is hidden because Renoir chooses not to show any details of their faces. His focus is on the effect of sunshine on the buildings and trees. The painting shows great detail in the shadows created by the sun shining on the trees, and also the shadows created by the people as well as the horse-drawn carriage.

It is housed at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces. The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening.\r Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light.\r From 1879 to 1894 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre until it was transferred to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in 1986.\r Renoir painted a smaller version of the picture (78 \u00d7 114\u00a0cm) with the same title. The painting is now believed to be in a private collection in Switzerland. Apart from their size, the two paintings are virtually identical, although the smaller is painted in a more fluid manner than the d'Orsay version. One is presumably a copy of the original, but it is not known which is the original. It is not even known which was the one first exhibited at the 3rd Impressionist exhibition of 1877, because although the painting was catalogued and given favourable attention by critics, its entry did not indicate the size of the painting, information that would serve to identify it.\r For many years it was owned by John Hay Whitney. On May 17, 1990, his widow sold the painting for US$78 million at Sotheby's in New York City to Ryoei Saito (Sait\u014d Ry\u014dei), the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Company, Japan.\r At the time of sale, it was one of the top two most expensive artworks ever sold, together with van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was also purchased by Saito. Saito caused international outrage when he suggested in 1991 that he intended to cremate both paintings with him when he died. However, when Saito and his companies ran into severe financial difficulties, bankers who held the painting as collateral for loans arranged a confidential sale through Sotheby's to an undisclosed buyer. Although not known for certain, the painting is believed to be in the hands of a Swiss collector.\r As of January\u00a02013 the Bal du moulin de la Galette is sixth (when adjusted for the consumer price index) on the list of most expensive paintings ever sold.\r Renoir conceived his project of painting the dancing at Le Moulin de la Galette in May 1876 and its execution is described in full by his civil servant friend Georges Rivi\u00e8re in his memoir Renoir et ses amis. In the first place, Renoir needed to set up a studio near the mill. A suitable studio was found at an abandoned cottage in the rue Cortot with a garden described by Rivi\u00e8re as a \"beautiful abandoned park\". Several of Renoir's major works were painted in this garden at this time, including La balan\u00e7oire (The Swing). The gardens and its buildings have been preserved as the Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: The Promenade\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-promenade\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLa Promenade is an oil on canvas, early Impressionist painting by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created in 1870. The work depicts a young couple on an excursion outside of the city, walking on a path through a woodland. Influenced by the rococo revival style during the Second Empire, Renoir's La Promenade reflects the older style and themes of eighteenth-century artists like Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and Jean-Antoine Watteau. The work also shows the influence of Claude Monet on Renoir's new approach to painting.\r The forest was a popular landscape subject for nineteenth-century French artists, particularly the forest of Fontainebleau. Before Renoir, Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) painted Bazille and Camille (Study for \"D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe\") (1865), showing a couple together in the forest. In 1869, Renoir and Monet spent time painting together at La Grenouill\u00e8re. By 1870, Renoir was living in Louveciennes with his mother. Throughout this decade, the eighteenth-century rococo art movement was back in style and Renoir embraced it. France declared war against Germany on July 19, 1870, starting the Franco-Prussian War. Renoir was conscripted and served four months in the cavalry but never saw combat.\r A young man, possibly a canotier, boatman, given his distinctive boater hat, holds the hand of a young woman on a path surrounded by bushes, perhaps on the banks of the Seine, with the implication of an upcoming intimate encounter. The image of lovers walking through a woodland is based on a popular rococo theme. Interpretations of the figure models vary. It is generally believed that the model for the woman in La Promenade was Lise Tr\u00e9hot, Renoir's favorite model and companion during his early Salon period. In the past, it was believed that the man in the painting was landscape painter Alfred Sisley (1839\u20131899) and the woman was Rapha, a companion of musician Edmond Ma\u00eetre (1840\u20131898).\r The original title of the painting is unknown. It first received the title La Promenade by unnamed owners of the work when it was put up for sale in 1898. It was not until 1941 that questions about the original title came to light. Renoir was known to strenuously object to sentimental titles applied by others to his work. \"Why have they given names to my pictures which never represent the reason I painted such and such a subject? My joy consists in painting, and it has never been in my mind to paint a preconceived subject\", Renoir said in his later years. However, Renoir did exhibit a painting with the title of La Promenade in 1876, but that work is now known as Mother and Children.\r In a commentary for the exhibition Origins of Impressionism (1994\u201395), Henri Loyrette writes that La Promenade \"succeeds at last in what Renoir had for so long and so vainly sought: the integration of the figure in a landscape\". Loyrette notes the influence of Monet in La Promenade and the change in Renoir's style since Les Fianc\u00e9s (1868). The Impressionist influence on Renoir, Perrin Stein writes, led to his increasing use of the high-key palette. Renoir's \"lightness and delicacy of touch\" here is, according to art historian John House, reminiscent of rococo artist Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732\u20131806). Critics also view the influence of Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684\u20131721) on this work, particularly in Renoir's use of the intimate couple in the woods, a motif popularized in scenes found in Watteau's f\u00eate galante genre.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: Pink and Blue\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/pink-and-blue-1881\n\nWikipedia Article:\nAlice and Elisabeth Cahen d\u2019Anvers (most commonly referred to as Pink and Blue) is an oil painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Produced in Paris in 1881, the painting depicts the sisters Alice and Elisabeth, daughters of Louise Cahen d'Anvers and her husband the Jewish banker Louis Rapha\u00ebl Cahen d'Anvers. It is considered one of the most popular works in the collection of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, where it has been conserved since 1952.\r Renoir portrayed the 2 daughters of Louise Cahen d'Anvers and her banker husband Louis Rapha\u00ebl Cahen d'Anvers, the blonde, Elisabeth, born in December 1874, and the younger, Alice, in February 1876, when they were respectively six and five years old. The artist produced many portraits for the families of the Parisian Jewish community at the time, and Louis Cahen d'Anvers, who married Louise de Morpurgo, descendant of a rich family from Trieste, was one of the most wealthy.\r Renoir was commissioned to paint many portraits for this family, which he had met through the collector Charles Ephrussi, who was proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts and also Louise's lover.. The idea was to make individual portraits of each daughter. Renoir portrayed the couple's oldest daughter, Irene, in a painting nowadays conserved at the Foundation E.G. B\u00fchrle, in Z\u00fcrich. Afterwards, the family decided that the other two sisters would be painted together. Louise paid Renoir 1,500 francs for the painting. \r According to Camesasca, there were many sitting sessions until the end of February 1881, after what Renoir went to Algiers. After some decades, the youngest of the models would remember that \"the boredom of the sitting sessions was recompensed by the pleasure of wearing the elegant lace dress\".\r Alice lived until 1965 and died in Nice, aged 89. In 1895, Alice married the British Army officer Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend who led his command to its destruction at Kut al Amara in 1916. Elisabeth had a tragic destiny. After divorcing from her first husband, the diplomat and count Jean de Forceville, she married Alfred \u00c9mile Denfert Rochereau, whom she later divorced as well. In 1987, during an exhibition of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art collection in the Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny, Switzerland, Elisabeth's nephew, Jean de Monbrison, wrote a letter to the museum reporting her sad end: although she was converted to Catholicism at a young age, she was sent to Auschwitz because of her Jewish descent and died on the way to the concentration camp in March 1944, aged 69.\n", "\nArtist: Pierre-Auguste Renoir\nArtwork Name: The Luncheon of the Boating Party\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-luncheon-of-the-boating-party-1881-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLuncheon of the Boating Party (1881; French: Le d\u00e9jeuner des canotiers) is a painting by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Included in the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, it was identified as the best painting in the show by three critics. It was purchased from the artist by the dealer-patron Paul Durand-Ruel and bought in 1923 (for $125,000) from his son by industrialist Duncan Phillips, who spent a decade in pursuit of the work. It is now in The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light.\r The painting, combining figures, still-life, and landscape in one work, depicts a group of Renoir's friends relaxing on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise restaurant along the Seine river in Chatou, France. The painter and art patron, Gustave Caillebotte, is seated in the lower right. Renoir's future wife, Aline Charigot, is in the foreground playing with a small dog, an affenpinscher; she replaced an earlier woman who sat for the painting but with whom Renoir became annoyed. On the table is fruit and wine.\r The diagonal of the railing serves to demarcate the two halves of the composition, one densely packed with figures, the other all but empty, save for the two figures of the proprietor's daughter Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and her brother, Alphonse Fournaise, Jr, which are made prominent by this contrast. In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The singlets of both men in the foreground and the table-cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.\r As he often did in his paintings, Renoir included several of his friends in Luncheon of the Boating Party. Identification of the sitters was made in 1912 by Julius Meier-Graefe. Among them are the following:\r At the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition in 1882, the painting generally received praise from critics. \"It is fresh and free without being too bawdy,\" wrote Paul de Charry in Le Pays, March 10, 1882. In La Vie Moderne (March 11, 1882), Armand Silvestre wrote, \"...one of the best things [Renoir] has painted...There are bits of drawing that are completely remarkable, drawing- true drawing- that is a result of the juxtaposition of hues and not of line.

After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.\r Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in St. Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey, and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of Moulin Huet Bay in St. Martin. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his Paris studio. Guernsey lies 48\u00a0km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the \"by the sea\" criterion in the exhibition title.\r However, By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was Aline Charigot, his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.\r The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H.

A complementary painting on the same theme, named Dance in the City, was also painted by Renoir the same year.\r The painting, influenced by the artist's trip in Italy in 1881 where he found inspiration from Raphael, marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from Impressionism.\r The painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lh\u00f4te, a friend of the painter, and the woman is Aline Charigot, who later became the wife of the painter.

The one standing in the water in the foreground appears to be about to splash one of the women seated on the shore with water. That woman leans back to avoid the expected splash of water.\r The figures have a sculptural quality, while the landscape behind them shimmers with impressionistic light. With this new style, Renoir's intention was to reconcile the modern forms of painting with the painting traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly those of Ingres and Raphael. Renoir also admired Rubens and Titian's works, and he tried to find a compromise between the styles of these old masters and the new impressionist style.\r It is inspired at least in part by a sculpture by Fran\u00e7ois Girardon, The Bath of the Nymphs (1672), a low lead relief realized for a fountain park of Versailles. It also reflects the influence of the works of Ingres, and particularly the frescoes of Raphael, whose style he had absorbed during his trip to Italy. These two great artists influenced Renoir's entire way of painting and drawing: he began to paint in a more disciplined and more conventional manner, gave up painting outdoors, and made the female nude\u00a0\u2013 until then only an occasional subject\u2013 his main focus.\r Renoir worked on The Bathers for three years until he was content with its composition. During that time, he made numerous studies and sketches, including at least two full-sized figure drawings of the theme.\r The Bathers may also be regarded as Renoir's pictorial testament. The models for the three bathers included two of his favorites: Aline Charigot, the blonde sitting behind, whom Renoir married in 1890, and Suzanne Valadon, herself a painter and the mother of Maurice Utrillo.\r After completing The Large Bathers, Renoir received severe criticism because of his new style. Tired and disillusioned, he never again created paintings of this caliber.

It is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Edgar Degas made some changes in the painting.\r The museum page provenance suggests the painting was possibly shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879 as Portrait de petite fille.\r By 1877 Cassatt had come into frank conflict with the official French art establishment and had had both her submissions for that year rejected by the Salon. So when Edgar Degas invited her to join the Impressionists the same year, a group similarly disaffected by the Salon system, she accepted with alacrity. A planned 1878 exhibition did not take place, because of what Degas judged would be competition from the World's Fair held in Paris that year, but she did hold what amounted to a show of her own at the Spring 1879 Impressionist exhibition, exhibiting a dozen oils and pastels. Exactly which works these all were is not now known with certainty, but it is likely that Little Girl in a Blue Armchair was amongst them.\r Cassatt submitted the painting to the Art Gallery of the American pavilion at the 1878 World's Fair, along with another that cannot now be identified. To her intense annoyance it was rejected, although the other was accepted. She expressed her irritation in a 1903 letter to the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard, which makes it plain how much Degas had been involved (he also supplied the model, a daughter of friends of his): \"It was the portrait of a friend of M. Degas. I had done the child in the armchair and he found it good and advised me on the background and he even worked on it. I sent it to the American section of the big exposition [of 1878], they refused it ... I was furious, all the more so since he had worked on it. At that time this appeared new and the jury consisted of three people of which one was a pharmacist!\"  Indeed, the painting is often cited as an example of Degas' influence.\r Recent cleaning and infra-red photography at the National Gallery of Art has confirmed Degas' contribution.\r The painting is described as \"it dazzles with its predominant hue of deep turquoise\" and has been regarded to be a masterpiece by Karen Rosenberg in a New York Times review.\r The dog pictured lying in the armchair next the little girl's in Little Girl in a Blue Armchair is a Brussels Griffon. Cassatt was probably introduced to this breed while in Antwerp 1873. Degas presented her with a pup he had procured from fellow Impressionist Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic, a dog lover who bred them, and Cassatt went on to keep them the rest of her life.

This painting shows a view of the modern woman and is similar in style to Degas.\r This oil on canvas painting is 32 x 23 1/2 inches (81.3 x 59.7\u00a0cm). The painting shows a woman sitting on a large red chair in the balconies of the Paris Op\u00e9ra House. The figure is seated in front of a massive mirror that is reflecting the theater scene that the woman is experiencing; it is also giving us the view point that the woman is having. As with Degas, Cassatt paid close attention to the \"effects of artificial lighting on flesh tones\". The woman is sitting enjoying the sights, the city nightlife that most Impressionists were fascinated with, as she people watches. She is dressed up, as with what was expected of going to a theater, with a peach colored dress, makeup, pearls, gloves and hair pinned back. She is holding a fan and a flower is attached to the bodice of the dress. She looks bemused with what she is seeing. The quick painterly style of Impressionist paintings can be seen here as Cassatt was heavily inspired by it. The background is very gestural and loose as people are carved out in simple brush marks of color. An elaborate chandelier is also shown in the reflection of the mirror. The rich colors of the painting draw the viewer in, deep shadows create contrast against the brightness of the light source. The brush strokes within the dress itself give a texture to it and a liveliness to the piece. The view in which the viewer is given brings an intimacy to the painting, making as though the viewer is there with the woman as she enjoys her evening.\r This painting shows the modern woman because it is not showing a piece for the male gaze. This piece is more about the woman than it is about the viewer. She is shown to be enjoying herself and is neither seductive nor nude. It is depicting an average night out in Paris and humanizing women in ways that male artists had not explored. Being a genre painter she was able to reproduce scenes of everyday life, domestic settings and parties, which she would romanticize to help create an ethereal air of wonder around the women she painted.\r Besides the quick brush strokes that was indicative of Impressionist paintings, Cassatt also implemented the tipped perspective that was common in many of Degas' paintings. This caused the viewers to never be quite able to figure out where in the painting they would be standing if they were present in that scene.\r Cassatt depicted the modern woman, giving her an elegance and beauty. \"There is nothing more graciously honest and aristocratic than her portraits of young women\". \"Glamour, fashionable costume, exquisitely tasteful settings served to create an idea that was understood to be intensely modern, a pale legacy of the poet\". She painted women of the emerging middle/upper class engaged in leisure activities such as attending the theater. Because of this she is considered a Realist because of her portrayal of women in daily lives, such as working women or women of leisure. The way in which she depicted the working class woman in \"maternal solicitude or personal anxiety are framed within\" these narratives. She was also considered to be a Post-Impressionist.\n", "\nArtist: Mary Cassatt\nArtwork Name: The Boating Party\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/mary-cassatt/the-boating-party-1894\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Boating Party is an 1893 oil painting by American artist Mary Cassatt.\r It has been in the collection of the National Gallery of Art since 1963.\r Cassat painted The Boating Party during the winter of 1893\u20131894 in Antibes, on the French Riviera.\r Cassat spent January and February 1894 at the Villa \"La Cigaronne,\" in Cap d'Antibes with her mother.\r Cassat was 49 years old when she painted The Boating Party. 1893 had been a successful year for Cassatt. She had completed the mural Modern Woman, commissioned for the Woman's Building at Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Her exhibition in 1893 at Durand-Ruel's gallery had been well received. (footnote: The exhibition contained ninety-eight items.) The French state had decided to purchase one of her paintings for the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg.\r The Boating Party depicts an unknown woman, a baby and a man in a sailboat.\r The boat has a canoe stern, is boomless, and has three thwarts. The inside of the boat is described as yellow.\r It is an unusual painting in Cassatt's \u0153uvre. While it does show her familiar theme of a mother and child, most of her other paintings are set in interiors or in gardens. It is also one of her largest oil paintings.\r In 1890 Cassatt visited the great Japanese Print exhibition at the ecole de Beaux-arts in Paris.\r Mary Cassatt owned Japanese prints by Kitagawa Utamaro (1753\u20131806).\r The exhibition at Durand-Ruel of Japanese art proved the most important influence on Cassatt.\r Frederick A. Sweet suggests that Cassatt may have been inspired by Edouard Manet's Boating from 1874.\r Boating was exhibited at the (fourth?) Impressionist Exhibition of 1879, where it was not well received. Cassatt however, convinced her friend Louisine Havemeyer to buy it. Much of the work from the Havemeyer collection was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, but some works were left to the Havemeyer children and have since ended up elsewhere.\r Art historian and museum administrator Frederick A. Sweet calls it \"One of the most ambitious paintings she ever attempted\". His 1966 analysis focusses on the balance of the \"powerful dark silhouette of the boatman\", the angle between the oar and the arm that \"thrusts powerfully into the centre of the composition towards the mother and child\" and \"delicate, feminine ones\".\r Cassatt placed the horizon at the top of the frame in Japanese fashion.\r colorplate 75 35 7/16x46 1/8 in.

The oil on canvas painting measures 117 by 82 centimetres (46\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a032\u00a0in).\r The painting depicts the artist's brother, Ren\u00e9 Caillebotte, wearing informal clothes and standing at a balcony. He is standing at a window from the family home in the Rue de Miromesnil in Paris, looking outwards into Boulevard de Malesherbes (the large, oblique cross-street in the background). It is a comparatively early work in Caillebotte's oeuvre and reveals his interest in urban Realism.\r In its theme of a figure seen from behind at an open window, the composition has precedents in German Romanticism, a notable example being Caspar David Friedrich's Woman at the Window (1822). Other examples include Goethe at the Window of His Room in Rome (1787) by Johann Heinrich Tischbein and The Morning Hour (1857\u201360) by Moritz von Schwind.\r Caillebotte's painting differs from his German antecedents in several ways, however. The man does not gaze upon nature, but rather looks out upon an urban scene. According to the art historian Kirk Varnedoe, \"a standard charm of the window view is our bemused curiosity as to what the observer is looking at; but Caillebotte's structure replaces this curiosity with something quite different.\" By placing the onlooking man off-center and depicting him from a somewhat elevated viewpoint, Caillebotte's painting creates a tense relationship between the dominant foreground figure, the emphatic perspectival diagonals, and the detailed street scene beyond. Varnedoe says \"the normal interior-exterior oppositions of the window are thus combined in a charged relationship, competitive or covalent, that is seemingly unprecedented\".\r Caillebotte presented this painting at the Impressionism exhibition of 1876 alongside a few of his other works, including Les raboteurs de parquet. Writer \u00c9mile Zola was impressed with technical achievement of the works, but was not enthusiastic about the style: \"Photography of reality which is not stamped with the original seal of the painter's talent\u2014that's a pitiful thing.\" He called the painting \"anti-artistic... because of the exactitude of the copying.\"\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: The Parquet Planers (The Floor Scrapers)\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-parquet-planers-1875\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLes raboteurs de parquet (English title: The Floor Scrapers) is an oil painting by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 by 146.5 centimetres (40.2\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a057.7\u00a0in). It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.\r Caillebotte\u2019s originality lay in his attempt to combine the careful drawing, modeling and exact tonal values encouraged by the Acad\u00e9mie with vivid colors, bold perspectives, keen sense of natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement. Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment\u2014now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation. Caillebotte\u2019s interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality. It must be noted, however, that it was part of a larger trend, not necessarily limited to homosexual artists, that was first introduced by Courbet in a painting of two wrestlers (Sz\u00e9pm\u00fcv\u00e9zeti Museum, Budapest). This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban working class. It reintroduces the subject of the male nude in the painting, but in a strikingly updated form. Instead of the heroes of antiquity, here are the heroes of modern life\u2014sinewy and strong\u2014in stooped poses that would appear demeaning if they did not convey a sense of masculine strength and honest labor. There is a motif of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers. The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, Edgar Degas.\r Despite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a \"vulgar subject matter\". He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a second, different version of Raboteurs from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme \u00e0 sa fen\u00eatre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as \"vulgar\".\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: Paris, a Rainy Day\nArtwork Genre: sketch and study\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/paris-a-rainy-day\n\nWikipedia Article:\nParis Street; Rainy Day (French Rue de Paris, temps de pluie) is a large 1877 oil painting by the French artist Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u20131894), and is his best known work. It shows a number of individuals walking through the Place de Dublin, in 1877 known as the Carrefour de Moscou, at an intersection to the east of the Gare Saint-Lazare in north Paris. Although Caillebotte was a friend and patron of many of the impressionist painters, and this work is part of that school, it differs in its realism and reliance on line rather than broad brush strokes.\r Caillebotte's interest in photography is evident. The figures in the foreground appear \"out of focus\", those in the mid-distance (the carriage and the pedestrians in the intersection) have sharp edges, while the features in the background become progressively indistinct. The severe cropping of some figures \u2013 particularly the man to the far right \u2013 further suggests the influence.\r The first showing of the painting was at the Third Impressionist Exhibition of 1877. It currently is owned by the Art Institute of Chicago. AIC curator Gloria Groom described the work as \"the great picture of urban life in the late 19th century.\"\r The tone of the light indicates that the painting is set on a wintery afternoon, and the two main figures walk underneath an umbrella. They are dressed in the height of contemporary Parisian fashion. She wears a hat, veil, diamond earring, demure brown dress, and a fur lined coat, described in 1877 as \"modern \u2013 or should I say, the latest fashion\". The man wears a moustache, topcoat, frock coat, top hat, bow tie, starched white shirt, buttoned waistcoat and an open long coat with collar turned up. They are unambiguously middle class, yet some working class figures may be seen in the background; a maid in a doorway, the decorator carrying a ladder, cut-off by the umbrella above him. Caillebotte juxtaposes the figures and the perspective in a playful manner, with one man appearing to jump from the wheel of a carriage; another pair of legs appear below the rim of an umbrella.\r The painting does not present a convivial mood. The figures seem mostly isolated, and their expressions are largely downcast. They appear to hurry rather than stroll through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts. The umbrellas shield them, in the words of Rose-Marie Hagen, \"not just from the rain, but, also it seems, from other passers by\". Characteristic of the positioning of the figures, the heads and eyes of the main couple are faced away from the man approaching them from their right. Hagen believes that given their close quarters, they will both be unable to comfortably step out of the man's way, but also their averted gaze applies equally to the viewer, who looks from a perspective equal to us. Caillebotte reproduces the effect of a camera lens in that the points at the center of the image seem to bulge. He also recreates the focusing effect of the camera in the way that it sharpens certain subjects of an image, but not others. The same purpose is seen in the overall clarity of the image. The foreground is in focus, but slightly smudged; the middle ground has sharp, clear edges and well defined subjects, and the background fades into the distance, becoming more and more blurry the farther back the eye travels. He makes the middle ground section more clear, mimicking the effect of a camera.\n", "\nArtist: Gustave Caillebotte\nArtwork Name: A Balcony in Paris\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/a-balcony-in-paris-1881\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Balcony in Paris (French: Un balcon \u00e0 Paris) is an oil on canvas painting by the French Impressionist painter Gustave Caillebotte.

It is held by the Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais in Geneva, Switzerland. The finished canvas measures 125 by 181 centimetres (49\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a071\u00a0in).\r The image shows pedestrians in the Place de l'Europe in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. The plaza is a large bridge joining six avenues, each named for a European capital, over the railroad yards at Gare Saint-Lazare. The view is from the rue de Vienne, looking towards the center of the plaza. One of the bridge's trusses is very prominent, visible in half of the image.\r Three individuals are seen in the foreground: a couple walking toward the observer, and a working-class man peering off the bridge toward the train station. A dog walks away from the observer, and other individuals appear in the mid-background. The man of the couple is a fl\u00e2neur, an upper-class street observer. He is strolling with a woman dressed in black. She has often been interpreted to be a prostitute, according to contemporary social norms regarding women in public, especially in the area of the train station. Alternatively, the man has been thought to be Caillebotte himself, and the woman to be Caillebotte's companion, Anne-Marie Hagen. The fl\u00e2neur is looking past his companion in the direction of the other man. Feminist art historian Norma Broude has suggested that Caillebotte, a lifelong bachelor, is signalling his own homosexuality with this gaze. In this reading, Caillebotte is an upper-class man cruising for a lower-class male prostitute in this unsavory neighborhood of Paris. However, Caillebotte's sexual orientation is not definitively known.\r Caillebotte displayed this image at the impressionist exhibition of 1877, alongside his Rue de Paris, temps de pluie and Claude Monet's Le Pont de l'Europe, Gare Saint-Lazare, which gives an alternate view of the bridge.\r Caillebotte, as in many of his works, employs perspective. The vanishing point is located behind the head of the man, which is far to the side of the picture, creating oblique perspective. Caillebotte was influenced by Japanese art, especially the work of Hiroshige, and by photography, then a burgeoning artistic field. In turn, this painted composition may have been an influence in photographer Jeff Wall's work from 1982, Mimic, which features similar exaggerated perspective and class tension between the three similarly situated characters.\r Caillebotte\u2019s The Europe Bridge shows how obeying the rules of society can work: the social classes indeed coexist, they meet each other on the streets, but they do not correlate. Hausmann\u2019s spacious boulevards allow such state of things. Paris won\u2019t ever come back to its Medieval past. \n", "\nArtist: Valentin Serov\nArtwork Name: Girl with Peaches\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/valentin-serov/girl-with-peaches-1887\n\nWikipedia Article:\nGirl with Peaches (Russian: \u0414\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438, Devochka s Persikami) is an 1887 painting by the Russian painter Valentin Serov.\r It is considered to be one of Serov's greatest works and one of his most famous.

According to the book 1000 Drawings of Genius, although the style of the painting (and Serov's early style in general) \"has much in common with the French Impressionists, [Serov] did not become acquainted with their work until after he had painted [it]\".\r The painting depicts 12-year-old Vera Mamontova, a daughter of Russian entrepreneur and patron of the arts Savva Mamontov.\r It was painted at Abramtsevo, an estate not far from Moscow. By the time Mamontov had bought the place from writer Sergei Aksakov in 1870, Abramtsevo had become one of the centers of Russian culture. He continued the tradition. Among people who stayed there were painter Ilya Repin, writer Ivan Turgenev, painter Mikhail Vrubel, and sculptor Mark Antokolsky. It was a comfortable place for artists not only to gather and discuss important topics, but to live and create.\r Valentin Serov knew Vera Mamontova from her babyhood, as he frequently visited Mamontov's Abramtsevo estate, sometimes even lived there for lengthy periods of time.\r Serov later recalled,\r In 1887 the painting won first prize at the Exhibition of the Moscow Society of Lovers of Art.\r The model, Vera Mamontova, married the head of the Moscow Nobility League, future Chief Prosecutor of the Most Holy Synod Alexander Dmitrievich Samarin\u00a0(ru) in 1903. They had three children. In 1907, at the age of 32, she contracted pneumonia and died just a few days later.

It is one of a series of painting Pissarro did of Pont Bo\u00efeldieu and the industrial quays surrounding it. Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On his 1896 trip he stayed at the H\u00f4tel de Paris in Rouen, from January to April 1896, and it is in this period that this painting was made. His room overlooked the Seine, and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.\r The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather is a return to Impressionism after a decade of experimenting with Post-Impressionism and Pointalism. Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.\r In a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: \"The theme is the bridge near the Placede la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain.\" He further wrote, \"what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.\r The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by Reuben Wells Leonard upon his death in 1937.

To their right, seated, is sculptor and critic Zacharie Astruc. Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne Manet is in foreground, right of centre, with white trousers; the composer Jacques Offenbach with glasses and moustache sits against a tree to the right; critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier stands against a tree in brown suit and full beard, while author Charles Baudelaire is to the left of Gautier. Henri Fantin-Latour is further left, with beard, looking at the viewer. The fair-haired child in the centre is L\u00e9on Leenhoff.\r The work measures 76.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0118.1 centimetres (30.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a046.5\u00a0in). It was first exhibited in 1863, and Manet sold the painting to opera singer and collector Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1883. It was sold on to dealer Durand-Ruel in 1898, and then to collector Sir Hugh Lane in 1903. After Lane's death, when RMS Lusitania was sunk in 1915, an unwitnessed codicil to his will left the painting to the Dublin City Gallery (now known as The Hugh Lane). The codicil was found to be invalid, and in 1917 a court case decided that his previous will left the work to the National Gallery in London. After intervention from the Irish government, the two galleries reached a compromise in 1959, agreeing to share the paintings, with half of the Lane Bequest lent and shown in Dublin every five years. The agreement was varied in 1993 so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland, and four of the remaining eight would be lent to Dublin for 6 years at a time.\r The colors in greater areas of this painting are generally subdued and executed in ochres or in mixtures of several pigments. The dark green foliage in the upper part contains a glaze of emerald green and Scheele's green mixed with yellow lake with small addition of ivory black and yellow ochre. The strong colourful accents in the bonets and clothes of the children are painted in almost pure pigments such as cobalt blue, vermilion or chrome orange.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Races at Longchamp\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/races-at-longchamp\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Races at Longchamp is an 1866 painting by the French artist \u00c9douard Manet. The Impressionist painting depicts a horse racing at Longchamp and is currently conserved at the Art Institute of Chicago. It has been exhibited many times, the first one at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in January 1884.\r The work is particularly innovative. About the painting, the Art Institute of Chicago said it \"is startling. We find ourselves on the racecourse with a cluster of onrushing horses and jockeys bearing directly down on us.

Partially a portrait of 16-year-old L\u00e9on Leenhoff \u2014 the son of Suzanne Leenhoff before her 1863 marriage to Manet, and possibly the son of Manet or Manet's father Auguste \u2014 it is also an enigmatic work that has received limited attention within Manet's oeuvre. Critic Nan Stalnaker notes that \"despite continued questions about its meaning, the work is acknowledged to be brilliantly painted and a major Manet work\".\r In the summer of 1868 Manet traveled to Boulogne-sur-Mer for his summer vacation, where he painted Luncheon in the Studio and other works. Luncheon was posed in the dining room of Manet's rented house.\r Leenhoff is the focus of the painting, with his back to the other two people, who have at various points been identified as his mother and Manet. These identifications are now seen as incorrect; the man seated at the table, smoking a cigar and enjoying a coffee and a digestif, is anonymous\u2014although he bears a resemblance to Manet (his friend, the painter Auguste Rousselin has also been suggested). The woman gazing toward the viewer is a servant. Given the uncertain status of Leenhoff's paternity, Meyers proposes that the two figures may nevertheless represent Suzanne and \u00c9douard symbolically, specifically \"their belated recognition and acceptance of Auguste [Manet]'s son\".\r In an otherwise muted color scheme, the yellow in Leenhoff's tie, pants, and straw hat connect with the lemon on the table. The armour that appears incongruently in the bottom-left corner recalls its symbolism and collectibility before and during the Second Empire, when it was also the subject of still lifes. The table holds more conventional subjects of the genre, including a peeled lemon, oysters, a Delft sugar bowl, and a knife that protrudes off the table. In this way Manet represents both the \"romantic\" and \"naturalistic\" modes of his art, according to Collins, who also notes, given the presence of the man in the background, that smoking was popular among \"young romantics\".\r The painting was exhibited in the 1869 Paris Salon along with Manet's The Balcony, another work that lacked a simple genre affiliation, and in which at least one of the figures seems to confront the viewer as if challenging the \"fourth wall\". Both pieces were found wanting by art critics of the day; by this time a common criticism of Manet was that his goal was to \"attract attention at any price\". The reviewer Jules-Antoine Castagnary criticized the two paintings in a quote that well reflects the conventional expectations of a painting in this period, just before the further turbulence that Impressionism brought upon art:\r Another critic, Marius Chaumelin, echoed this sentiment (speaking of both paintings): \"The personages... are not at all handsome [except for the seated woman in The Balcony, Berthe Morisot], their faces having something morose and disagreeable about them, like the faces of persons who pose, and in fact all these figures have the air of saying to us: Look at me!... Thus, no expression, no feeling, no composition.\" He spoke of \"types without character, scenes devoid of all interest\" and said disparagingly (yet insightfully from the point of view of modern criticism) that \"Manet had made the portrait of a Balcony and a Luncheon\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The reading\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-reading-1869\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Reading is an oil painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet, circa 1865 - 1873.\r The painting was first exhibited in 1880 in one of the regular solo exhibitions mounted by Manet in his workshop. The picture was also part of the great posthumous exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his death.\r The work first belonged to the private collection of Winnaretta Singer, Princess Edmond de Polignac, where it remained until 1944, after the death of the Princess. It was offered as a gift to the French State and deposited in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. In 1947, it was transferred to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a showroom located in the Jardin des Tuileries and which belongs to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986, when, with the creation of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, it was brought to this museum, like the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, in room 31 of level 5.\r The painting depicts the artist's wife, Suzanne Manet (born Suzanne Leenhoff), seated, and their son, Leon, standing and reading a book. Leon was a recurrent model for Manet who portrayed him in several pictures, such as The Lunch, The Boy Carrying a Sword and The Bubbles of Soap.\r In this work the white woman's dress dominates, and the sofa and curtains are treated with broad strokes of high brightness, in counterpoint to the dark tone of the belt and collar. According to Peter H. Feist, in this painting \"Manet reacts more sensitive than usual, and looks especially to shades of white that are offered to his eyes\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Effect of Snow at Petit-Montrouge\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/effect-of-snow-at-petit-montrouge-1870\n\nWikipedia Article:\nEffect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge (French: Effet de neige \u00e0 Petit-Montrouge) is an 1870 landscape painting by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet.\r The oil on canvas painting shows a winter view of Petit-Montrouge, an area in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Manet painted this picture while a member of the National Guard during the 1870\u201371 Siege of Paris of the Franco-Prussian War. As opposed to the history painters of his time, Manet does not show a heroic view of battle, but rather the dusky ambiance of a looming battle. The image reflects Manet's loss of hope about the military situation, his profound loneliness, and the deprivation he suffered during this time. It is one of the few landscapes in Manet's oeuvre, and is one of Manet's first plein air paintings. Today it is in the collection of the National Museum Cardiff.\r Manet uses earthly and muted tones to illustrate an urban snow landscape; between the large peaks of white and diagonals of murky brown the Paris district of Petit-Montrouge is illustrate, overshadowed by the brown dirty snow and bleak beige sky. The buildings in the background were painted with muted colours to give an appearance of balancing precariously on a huge expanse of brown.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Berthe Morisot with a bouquet of violets\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/berthe-morisot-with-a-bouquet-of-violets-1872\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBerthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets (French: Berthe Morisot au bouquet de violettes) is an 1872 oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet. It depicts fellow painter Berthe Morisot dressed in black mourning dress, with a barely visible bouquet of violets. The painting, sometimes known as Portrait of Berthe Morisot, Berthe Morisot in a black hat or Young woman in a black hat, is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. Manet also created an etching and two lithographs of the same composition.\r Manet became acquainted with Berthe Morisot in 1868. She was the grand-niece of Fragonard, and also a painter; Morisot and Manet influenced each other's work. He painted her portrait many times, including his earlier work The Balcony. She married Manet's brother Eug\u00e8ne in 1874.\r Manet had remained in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71, and served in the Garde Nationale to defend the city in the Siege of Paris. He was unable to paint while he was serving, and left Paris after the city surrendered at the end of January 1871. He returned to painting later in 1871, and returned to Paris after the defeat of the Paris Commune in May 1871.\r This painting was one of several portraits of a black-clad Morisot by Manet in 1872-74: others show her with a pink shoe, with a fan, and veiled.\r The half-length portrait is on a canvas measuring 55.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040.5 centimetres (21.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015.9\u00a0in) \u2014 71.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a057.5 centimetres (28.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022.6\u00a0in) with frame \u2014 and is signed \"Manet 72\" in the upper right corner. It is a study in shades of black. Unusually for Manet's portraits, which typically have an even light, Morisot is lit from one side, so that she is brightly illuminated on her right side and the left is in deep shadow. She wears black mourning dress and hat, with her face surrounded by black ribbons and scarves, against a lighter background, and an earring in each ear. The violet flowers are barely perceptible where the neckline of Morisot's dress dips towards her chest. Manet also painted violets in his Woman with a Parrot of 1866.\r Manet painted Morisot with black eyes, although her eyes were actually green. The dark costume and eyes may allude to Manet's impression that she looked Spanish. Manet had earlier painted a similar portrait of his own mother in mourning, made in 1863, which shows his mother clad in black, on a dark background.\r The painting was followed by a similar etching - probably the first copy, with the pose reversed - and two lithographs, all made in 1872 to 1874. Manet made a similar painting of Morisot in mourning dress in 1874, after the death of her father, Edm\u00e9 Tiburce Morisot.\r The work was quickly considered a masterpiece of Manet's work. It was praised by Paul Val\u00e9ry in the catalogue of Manet's retrospective at the Orangerie in 1932 for the centenary of his birth. Val\u00e9ry knew the painting well: he was married to Morisot's niece, Jeannie Gobillard, the daughter of Morisot's sister Yves and her husband Theodore Gobillard, and so he also related by marriage to Manet; indeed, his wedding in 1900 was a double celebration at the same time as the marriage of Morisot's daughter Julie Manet to Ernest Rouart. Val\u00e9ry compared Manet's painting to Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring: \"I do not rank anything in Manet's work higher than a certain portrait of Berthe Morisot dated 1872\".\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Railway\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/railway-1873\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Railway, widely known as Gare Saint-Lazare, is an 1873 painting by \u00c9douard Manet. It is the last painting by Manet of his favourite model, the fellow painter Victorine Meurent, who was also the model for his earlier works Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1874, and donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956.\r Meurent is depicted sitting to the left side of the frame, in front of an iron fence near the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris. The pensive subject is wearing a dark hat and sombre deep blue dress with white details, and is looking towards the viewer, while a sleeping puppy, a fan and an open book rest in her lap. Next to her is a little girl, modelled by the daughter of Manet's neighbour Alphonse Hirsch, a contrasting figure wearing a white dress with large blue bow, standing her back to the viewer, watching through the railings as a train passes beneath them. The black band in the girl's hair echoes the black band around the neck of the woman. Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opted for the iron grating which \"boldly stretches across the canvas\" (Gay 106). The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. Modern apartment buildings can be seen in the background, including the house on the Rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg, near the Place de l'Europe, where Manet had rented a studio since July 1872, and also a signal box and the Pont de l'Europe.\r The arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus, separated from the background by the row of railings. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored. Resting on a parapet to the right of the painting is a bunch of grapes, perhaps indicating that the painting was made in the autumn. The dog may be a reference to Titian's Venus of Urbino; Manet had earlier echoed Titian's composition in his Olympia.\r Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: \"Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. Caricaturists ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today\". The painting is currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\r Shortly after it was completed, the painting was sold to baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure. It was sold in 1881 for 5,400 francs to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who gave it several names: Enfant regardant le chemin de fer, Le pont de l'Europe, A la Gare St. Lazare, and later just Gare St. Lazare. It was sold on 31 December 1898 for 100,000 francs to American Henry Osborne Havemeyer. His wife Louisine Havemeyer left 2,000 artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on her death in 1929, but she divided a small collection, including The Railway, among her three children. The painting was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956 on the death of her son Horace Havemeyer.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Nana\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/nana-1877\n\nWikipedia Article:\nNana is a painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet. It was completed in 1877 and was refused at the Salon of Paris the same year. The work is now at the Kunsthalle Hamburg art museum in Germany.\r The painting shows a young and beautiful woman who stands before a mirror with two extinguished candles, her face turned to the spectator. Her dress is incomplete; she wears a white chemise, blue corset, silk stockings and high-heeled footwear. The interior suggests that it is a boudoir. Behind the woman is a sofa with two pillows. An elegantly dressed man, sitting on the sofa, can be partly seen on the right of the painting. On the left side, there is a chair, a table and a flowerpot.\r Both the title and the numerous details suggest that the picture represents a high class prostitute and her client. \"Nana\" was a popular assumed name for female prostitutes during the second half of the 19th century (much like the connotation \"Candy\" has had for English-speakers more recently). Even today the French word \"nana\" is used to describe a frivolous woman (or simply \"a female\" in argot).\r Manet wanted to present the painting at the Salon of Paris but it was rejected because it was deemed to be contemptuous of the morality of the time. French society was not prepared for such frank depictions of prostitution, and the critics did not see the artistic qualities of the work and concentrated solely on the scene which was represented. One of the defenders of Manet was \u00c9mile Zola who in 1880 published a novel of the same name as the ninth volume of Les Rougon-Macquart series. However, there is no clear evidence of mutual inspiration in the choice of the theme and the title as the book was published three years later. Perhaps Manet found inspiration in L'Assommoir, Zola's previous book, in which the character of Nana appears for the first time.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Plum\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/plum-1878\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Plum (French: La Prune) - also known as Plum Brandy - is an oil-on-canvas painting by \u00c9douard Manet. It is undated but thought to have been painted about 1877.\r The painting is a study in loneliness, depicting a quiet, almost melancholy, scene of a young working girl seated in a caf\u00e9. The subject is viewed from nearby, perhaps by another seated customer. She may be a prostitute waiting for a client, or possibly a shop worker hoping for some conversation. On the table is a plum soaked in brandy, a speciality of Parisian caf\u00e9s at the time (originally painted as a glass of beer), which gives the painting its title. She may be waiting for a waiter to bring a spoon to eat her plum. The plum may be a reference to the woman's sexuality, as the fruit was later used in James Joyce's Ulysses. She leans forward, with her cheek resting on her right hand, and her right elbow on the marble tabletop, looking into the distance with a blank pensive look. Her left hand rests on the table holding an unlit cigarette. She wears a pink dress with embroidered cuffs, a white blouse, and a black hat draped with silk and lace. Her head is framed by the decorative grille behind her, above the red upholstered banquette on which she sits.\r Manet may have based the painting on observations at the Caf\u00e9 de la Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes on the Place Pigalle in Paris. However, the background - the decorative grille and its gold frame - does not match other depictions of the caf\u00e9, and suggests the painting was made in Manet\u2019s studio, where he is known to have had a caf\u00e9-style marble table on iron legs. Manet uses a simple style: for example, the plum in its glass and the fingers of the woman's left hand are created with just a few dabs of colour.\r The model is the actress Ellen Andr\u00e9e, who was also depicted with Marcellin Desboutin in the similar 1876 painting L'Absinthe (or In a Caf\u00e9) by Edgar Degas. The similarities between the two paintings suggest that Manet's The Plum may be a response to Degas's L'Absinthe. Degas's painting shows a bleak scene of despair blunted by absinthe; Manet's is a more hopeful scene, where there is the chance that the sitter's loneliness may be broken. Andr\u00e9e also appears in Renoir's 1881 painting Luncheon of the Boating Party. Edward Hopper's 1927 painting Automat has a similar theme.\r The painting measures 73.6 centimetres (29.0\u00a0in) by 50.2 centimetres (19.8\u00a0in). Manet sold the painting to collector Charles Deudon in about 1881. It was inherited by Deudon's wife on his death in 1914 and sold before 1919. It came into the collection of Arthur Sachs and was then sold by M. Knoedler & Co to Paul Mellon in 1961. It was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in 1971.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: At the Cafe-Concert\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/at-the-cafe-concert\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Caf\u00e9-Concert is an 1879 painting by the French painter \u00c9douard Manet, who often captured caf\u00e9 scenes depicting social life at the end of the nineteenth century similar to those depicted in this painting.\r The setting has been identified as the Brasserie Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart. Manet shows us men and women in the new brasseries and cafes of Paris, which presents the viewer with an alternate view of new Parisian life. Manet claimed he was painting \u201cdes oeuvres sinceres\u201d or \u201csincere works\u201d. The women depicted in these scenes were courting certain risks with regards to perception and morality.\r In The Caf\u00e9-Concert, Manet presents a caf\u00e9-concert in which three central figures form a triangle but are all engaged in opposite directions. The scene of a caf\u00e9-concert, supposedly casual, is hinted by Manet to be one of separation. The waitress enjoys a beer, while the woman at the bar smokes a cigarette and appears subdued and the man appears to be at ease as he watches the performance (the singer known as \u201cLa Belle Polonaise\u201d is reflected in the mirror in the background of the painting). It is noted that the man evokes confidence, because men unlike women could frequent caf\u00e9\u2019s without insecurity. The painting was posed and completed in a studio but gives the appearance of being freshly observed.\r In this painting, concepts of conventional composition are rejected. The figures of the individuals represented are not clearly defined but modeled with brushstrokes. The colors are placed directly on the canvas with loose, repetitive strokes instead of applying layers of pigments and glazes over a dark background.\r Currently, The Caf\u00e9-Concert is being featured in Off the Wall, an open-air exhibition on the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of The Walters Art Museum collection, will be on display at the CFG Community Bank (Fell's Point). The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S..

This late impressionistic work is one of his two self-portraits. Velasquez's self-portrait in Las Meninas was a particular inspiration for Manet's painting which despite its allusion to the previous artist's work is very modern in its focus upon the personality of the artist and loose paint handling.\r A long series of prominent collectors have owned this painting. Most recently, it sold for $29.48 million at Sotheby's on 22 June 2010.\r The 83 \u00d7 67\u00a0cm (33 \u00d7 26 in) painting shows a half-length portrait of the painter \u00c9douard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier in front of a dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.\r Because Manet was almost certainly not left-handed, the painting is a mirror image.\r As has been established by X-ray analysis, Manet painted his Self-Portrait with Palette over a portrait in profile of his wife Suzanne Manet. In this picture she was depicted in a pose similar to that in the painting Madame Manet at the Piano (1868, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay).\r The dating of the painting goes back to Manet's friend Th\u00e9odore Duret, who asked L\u00e9on Leenhof, the son of Manet's wife, about it after the painter's death. Moreover, Manet had used the same suit jacket that he wore in Self-Portrait with Palette in the painting At \"P\u00e8re Lathuille\" (also from 1879), for the depiction of the son of the restaurant's owner.\r Las Meninas, in which Diego Vel\u00e1zquez depicted himself in a similar pose with brush and palette, is considered an important precedent for the Self-Portrait with Palette. There the painter stands almost in the background of his studio, while his models, the five-year-old Margarita Teresa of Spain and her servants, occupy the foreground. From here Manet appropriated the pose of the painter and his equipment, but as opposed to Vel\u00e1zquez, he makes himself the thematic center of the image. At the same time, however, he is working on a painting, but leaves its subject matter, as well as his surroundings, to the imagination of the viewer. Manet himself between 1865 and 1870 portrayed Vel\u00e1zquez in a studio scene in which the Spanish painter is posed similarly to his self-portrait.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The conservatory\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-conservatory-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nIn the Conservatory (French: Dans la serre) is an 1879 oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin, depicting Manet's friends, a couple, in a conservatory. There is an ambiguity in the painting that has led art critics to characterize the couple's relationship in divergent ways.\r The setting is a conservatory at 70 Rue d'Amsterdam in Paris, then owned by painter Otto Rosen and which Manet used as a studio for nine months in 1878 and 1879. Such a conservatory may have been more than a greenhouse; French painter Alix-Louise Enault's Consolation depicted the Parisian conservatory as a \"luxuriously decorated and intimate locale\u2014a secluded indoor area conducive to private rendezvous\". At first glance, we see a double portrait of a fashionable and attractive couple of some social rank. They are Manet's friends, the Guillemets, who owned a clothing shop. Their married status is conveyed by their rings, and the proximity of their hands is the nearest hint of intimacy. The woman becomes the focus of the portrait, however, being more prominently placed and colourfully dressed. Their physical separation\u2014with the husband Jules slouching in dark clothing behind the bench\u2014their lack of engagement with the viewer, and their abstract gazes create a sense of detachment, which has been the primary theme in modern criticism of the work.\r The interplay of lines formally defines the work. The woman has an erect posture echoed by the vertical slats of the bench, and the man, though leaning forward, does not break that vertical. The bench continues off the right side, reinforcing the horizontal and the separation of foreground and background. The diagonal pleats on the woman's dress provide some relief from the linearity of the composition.\r Since the painting's exhibition, critics have interpreted the couple's relationship diversely. Huysmans called the subjects \"marvelously detached from the envelope of green surrounding them\". As Collins summarizes:\r The painting was exhibited in the 1879 Paris Salon and was regarded as surprisingly conservative for Manet. Jules-Antoine Castagnary wrote, with tongue in cheek, \"But what is this? Face and hands more carefully drawn than usual: is Manet making concessions to the public?\"\u2014and said it portrayed \"the elegance of fashionable life\".\r Manet's Chez le P\u00e8re Lathuille (see Gallery), having similar subjects and painted later in the same year, may be seen as a companion to In the Conservatory. It was not included in the 1879 Salon.\r Jean-Baptiste Faure bought In the Conservatory from Manet, along with three other paintings, for the \"paltry sum\" of 11,000 francs. In 1896 the Deutsche Nationalgalerie in Berlin purchased it, becoming the first museum worldwide that purchased a picture of Manet.\r In 1945 by the end of the Second World War In the Conservatory was among the objects evacuated from the German National Gallery and the Berlin State Museums and put for safekeeping in a mine in Merkers. After the war the picture was discovered and secured by the Monuments Men. Its salvage was documented in several photographs which show soldiers from the U.S. Army posing with Manet\u2019s painting in the mine in Merkers. These photographs have gained iconographic status over the years and are often falsely used as an illustration of Nazi looted art in prestigious publications like the Deutsche Welle, The Washington Post, The New York Times and even in academic papers.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: The Suicide\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-suicide\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Suicid\u00e9 is a small oil painting by \u00c9douard Manet, completed between 1877 and 1881. The painting has been little studied within Manet's oeuvre, as if art historians have had difficulty finding a place for the work within the development of Manet's art.\r The pictorial content of the painting is limited to a man who appears to have just shot himself\u2014still holding a gun while slouched on a bed\u2014and a few pieces of furniture. Manet has removed the trappings of earlier depictions of suicide, and provided next to no narrative content or \"moralizing tendency\". Ilg associates the painting with the realism of Gustave Courbet, noting that Courbet also used a depiction of death in his Burial at Ornans (1849\u201350), a work that Courbet later indicated marked the beginning of his new artistic approach.\r The realism of Le Suicid\u00e9 has fueled speculation that it depicts an actual suicide, but the subject, if any, is not known. Speculation has concerned an assistant of Manet who committed suicide in Manet's studio more than a decade earlier. Another suicide proposed to be connected with the painting was that of an artist whom \u00c9mile Zola had written about in 1866. Recent critics have downplayed these associations.\r Manet's approach to this depiction may represent his continuing desire to break from academic tradition, in which a depiction of suicide could only fit within the genre of history painting\u2014where death and suicide would be placed within a narrative associated with sacrifice, idealism, or heroism. Examples in the French language include The Death of Socrates (1787) by Jacques-Louis David, which depicts Socrates' choice to kill himself by hemlock rather than go into exile. There is no such grand statement underlying Manet's painting. The artist has not given us a time, a place, or a protagonist. The painting is plainly constructed rather than carefully styled. This departure from tradition would have been controversial with contemporary viewers.\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: A Bar at the Folies-Bergere\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/a-bar-at-the-folies-bergere-1882-1\n\nWikipedia Article:\nA Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re (French: Un bar aux Folies Berg\u00e8re), painted and exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1882, is considered the last major work of French painter \u00c9douard Manet. It depicts a scene in the Folies Berg\u00e8re nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, who was Manet's neighbor. Chabrier hung it over his piano. The painting is currently in The Courtauld Gallery in London, England.\r The painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to Realism in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.\r The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics\u2014accusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting\u2014have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet. According to this reconstruction, \"the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick\u2014the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her.\" As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective.\r Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters. It provides a meaningful parallel with Las Meninas, a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book The Order of Things (1966).\r The art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: \u201cBehind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty has called a mirror \u2018the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.\u2019 We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet\u2019s \u2018preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.\u2019 Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she\u2019s self-protectively withdrawn and remote.\u201d\r The painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings. T.J. Clark says that the barmaid is \"intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Berg\u00e8re was well-known\", who is represented \"as both a salesperson and a commodity\u2014something to be purchased along with a drink.\"\n", "\nArtist: Edouard Manet\nArtwork Name: Spring (Study of Jeanne Demarsy)\nArtwork Genre: portrait\nArtwork Media: aquatint,canvas,etching,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/spring-study-of-jeanne-demarsy-1882\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSpring is a painting by \u00c9douard Manet that was created in 1881. It debuted at the Paris Salon of 1882 and was considered the greatest and final public success of Manet's Salon career. It depicts Parisian actress Jeanne DeMarsy in a floral dress with parasol and bonnet against a background of lush foliage and blue sky, as the embodiment of Spring. The painting also became the first work of art ever to be published in color.\r Spring was the first of a planned quartet of allegorical works using chic Parisian women to depict the four seasons. The idea came from Manet\u2019s friend, Antonin Proust, who suggested a series of seasons personified by contemporary ideals of women, fashion and beauty. The series was never finished and Manet died a year after finishing only the second of the series, Autumn.\r In November 2014, the J.

It is a large work painted en plein air; the size of the canvas necessitated Monet painting its upper half with the canvas lowered into a trench he had dug, so that he could maintain a single point of view for the entire work. The setting is the garden of a property he was renting. His companion Camille posed for the figures. Monet finished the work indoors, and used magazine illustrations to render fashionable clothing.\r Monet at this time was early in his career, experimenting with method and subject matter. His earlier paintings were successful at Paris Salons, but Women in the Garden was rejected in 1867 on the grounds of subject and narrative weakness. The Salon was also troubled by Monet's heavy brushstrokes, a style which would, of course, become one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. A judge commented, \"Too many young people think of nothing but continuing in this abominable direction. It is high time to protect them and save art!\" The painting was purchased by fellow artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille to help support Monet at a time when he had no money.\r Although the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the painting's owner, comments that \"Monet has skilfully rendered the white of the dresses, anchoring them firmly in the structure of the composition\", Christoph Heinrich, author of a Monet biography, notes how posterity has found the painting lacking. In this view, the figures appear poorly integrated into the scene, with the woman at right \"gliding across the ground as if she had a trolley concealed beneath her dress\". The painting's treatment of light and shadow is lauded, however, and in this respect the work may have shown Monet where his artistic path lay.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Garden at Sainte-Adresse\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/garden-at-sainte-adresse\n\nWikipedia Article:\nThe Garden at Sainte-Adresse is a painting by the French impressionist painter, Claude Monet. (Oil on canvas, 98.1\u00a0cm x 129.9\u00a0cm). The painting was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art after an auction sale at Christie's in December 1967, under the French title La terrasse \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse. The painting was exhibited at the 4th Impressionist exhibition, Paris, April 10\u2013May 11, 1879, as no. 157 under the title Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse.\r Monet spent the summer of 1867 at the resort town of Sainte-Adresse on the English Channel, near Le Havre (France). It was there, in a garden with a view of Honfleur on the horizon, that he painted this picture, which combines smooth, traditionally rendered areas with sparkling passages of rapid, separate brushwork, and spots of pure colour.\r The models were probably Monet's father, Adolphe, in the foreground, Monet's cousin Jeanne Margu\u00e9rite Lecadre at the fence; Dr. Adolphe Lecadre, her father; and perhaps Lecadre's other daughter, Sophie, the woman seated with her back to the viewer.\r Although the scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monet's relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artist's liaison with his companion, Camille Doncieux, his wife to be.\r Monet called this work in his correspondence \"the Chinese painting in which there are flags\"; his friend, Renoir referred to it as \"the Japanese painting\". In the 1860s, the composition's flat horizontal bands of colour would have reminded the sophisticated of Japanese colour wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture, \"Turban-shell Hall of the Five-Hundred-Rakan Temple\" (1830), remains today at Monet's house-museum at Giverny.\r The elevated vantage point and relatively even sizes of the horizontal areas emphasize the two-dimensionality of the painting. The three horizontal zones of the composition seem to rise parallel to the picture plane instead of receding into space. The subtle tension resulting from the combination of illusionism and the two-dimensionality of the surface remained an important characteristic of Monet's style.\r The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

It was painted in 1867 and is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r This painting and The Beach in Sainte-Adresse (Art Institute of Chicago) were probably conceived as a pair. They are identical in size, and their viewing point differs by only a few yards.\r Sainte-Adresse, the well-to-do suburb of Le Havre, was the home of Monet's father. Destitute, Monet spent the summer of 1867 with his father and aunt Sophie Lecadre at the cost of abandoning his companion, Camille Doncieux, and their newborn son, Jean. Monet attended the birth in Paris and returned to the coast a few days later.\r The pair of paintings juxtaposes this sunny regatta watched at high tide by well dressed bourgeois, with an overcast scene at low tide, fishing boats hauled onto the beach peopled with sailors and workers. Since Monet never exhibited the paintings side by side, the contrast between them was probably not intended as a social manifesto but instead reflected differing conditions under which the same place could be painted.\r On 25 June 1867, Monet reported that he was working on about twenty pictures:\r The painting is signed at the lower left.\r ?Henri Hecht, Paris (1873; bought in January for Fr 500 from the artist);\u00a0?sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, April 5, 1884, no. 25, as \"Sainte-Adresse\"; [Durand-Ruel, Paris, about 1888\u201391, sold on August 20, 1891 to Widener]; P.

Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in \u00c9tretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.\r Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.\r The Magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet. His first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter. The Magpie was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting. It was followed by The Red Cape (1869\u20131871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.\r The canvas of The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows. The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul earlier in the century.\r At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.\r In the late 1850s, French landscape painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin (1824\u20131898) introduced Monet (1840\u20131926) to the art of painting en plein air\u2014\"in the open air\", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. \"If I have become a painter,\" Monet said, \"I owe it to Boudin.\"\r The landscape paintings of Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819\u20131891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. \"Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master,\" Monet later reminisced. \"It was he who completed the education of my eye\". This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: The\u00a0Grenouill\u00e8re\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/the-grenouill%C3%A8re\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBain \u00e0 la Grenouill\u00e8re is a painting by the impressionist painter, Claude Monet.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who has just spent two months here, also wants to do this painting.\" Monet and Renoir, both desperately poor, were quite close at the time.\r The painting here and one in the London National Gallery (Bathers at La Grenouillere, oil on canvas, 73 x 92\u00a0cm) are probably the sketches mentioned by Monet in his letter. A bigger size painting, now lost but formerly in the Arnhold collection in Berlin, may well have been the \"tableau\" that he dreamed of. The broad, constructive brushstrokes here are clearly those of a sketch. For his exhibition pictures Monet usually sought a more delicate and carefully calibrated surface at this time. An almost identical composition of the same subject by Renoir is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. The two friends were undoubtedly working side by side.\r La Grenouill\u00e8re was a popular middle-class resort consisting of a spa, a boating establishment and a floating caf\u00e9. Optimistically promoted as \"Trouville-sur-Seine\", it was located on the Seine near Bougival, easily accessible by train from Paris and had just been favoured with a visit by Emperor Napoleon III with his wife and son. Monet and Renoir both recognized in La Grenouill\u00e8re an ideal subject for the images of leisure they hoped to sell.\r As in his earlier picture of the Garden at Sainte-Adresse, Monet concentrated on repetitive elements \u2013 the ripples on the water, the foliage, the boats, the human figures \u2013 to weave a fabric of brushstrokes which, although emphatically brushstrokes, retain a strong descriptive quality.\r The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Shown at what would later be known as the \"Exhibition of the Impressionists\" in April 1874, the painting is attributed to giving rise to the name of the Impressionist movement. Impression, Sunrise depicts the port of Le Havre, Monet's hometown, and is his most famous painting of the harbor.\r Impression, Sunrise is displayed at the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in Paris.\r Monet visited his hometown of Le Havre in the Northwest of France in 1872 and proceeded to create a series of works depicting the port of Le Havre. The six painted canvases depict the port \"during dawn, day, dusk, and dark and from varying viewpoints, some from the water itself and others from a hotel room looking down over the port\".\r Impression, Sunrise became the most famous in the series after being debuted in April 1874 in Paris at an exhibition by the group \"Painters, Sculptors, Engravers etc. Inc.\" Among thirty participants, the exhibition was led by Monet, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, and showed over two hundred works that were seen by about 4,000 people, including some rather unsympathetic critics.\r In 1985 the painting was stolen from the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet by Philippe Jamin and Youssef Khimoun. It was recovered and returned to the museum in 1990,, and put back on display in 1991.\r Monet claimed that he titled the painting Impression, Sunrise due to his hazy painting style in his depiction of the subject: \"They asked me for a title for the catalogue, it couldn't really be taken for a view of Le Havre, and I said: 'Put Impression.'\" In addition to this explanation for the title of the work, art historian Paul Smith claims that Monet might have named the painting Impression to excuse his painting from accusations of being unfinished or lacking descriptive detail, but Monet received these criticisms regardless of the title.\r While the title of the painting seemed to be chosen in haste for the catalogue, the term \"Impressionism\" was not new. It had been used for some time to describe the effect of paintings from the Barbizon school. Both associated with the school, Daubigny and Manet had been known to use the term to describe their own works.\r In critic Louis Leroy's review of the 1874 exhibition, \"The Exhibition of the Impressionists\" for the newspaper Le Charivari, he used \"Impressionism\" to describe the new style of work displayed, which he said was typified by Monet\u2019s painting of the same name.\r Before the 1860s and the debut of Impression, Sunrise, the term \"impressionism\" was originally used to describe the effect of a natural scene on a painter, and the effect of a painting on the viewer. By the 1860s, \"impression\" was used by transference to describe a painting which relayed such an effect. In turn, impression came to describe the movement as a whole.\r Initially used to describe and deprecate a movement, the term Impressionism \"was immediately taken up by all parties\" to describe the style, and Monet\u2019s Impression, Sunrise considered to encapsulate the start of the movement and its name.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: Boulevard of Capucines\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/boulevard-of-capucines-1874\n\nWikipedia Article:\nBoulevard des Capucines is an oil on canvas street scene painting of Boulevard des Capucines by French Impressionist artist Claude Monet created in 1873.\r From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists, met with rejection from the conservative Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris.

This painting\u2014number\u00a0352 in Wildenstein\u2019s catalogue of the works of Monet\u2014is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.\r Most of Monet\u2019s Snow at Argenteuil pictures from the winter of 1874\u20131875 were painted from locations close to the house on the boulevard\u00a0Saint-Denis (now number 21\u00a0boulevard\u00a0Karl Marx) into which Monet and his family had just moved.

She bequeathed it to the Art Gallery (now National Museum Cardiff) in Cardiff, Wales. The painting is normally on display there.\r There is a version in the Bridgestone Museum of Art.\r San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo is approximately two-by-three feet and painted in oil on canvas. It depicts mysterious buildings that seem to magically appear from the surrounding landscape, they almost seem to float in the background. The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity. The painting focuses on the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of Santa Maria della Salute and the mouth of the Grand Canal.\r Monet painted the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in six lighting conditions. With this varied approach, the paintings focused on the \u2018nature of experience.\u2019 He was particularly impressed by the Venetian sunsets, \u201cthese splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.\u201d He had previously been inspired by other sunsets, such as those of Normandy (in Rouen Cathedral and Haystacks, his series of the 1890s) and London (Houses of Parliament).\r Monet and his wife Alice stayed at the Palazzo Barbaro for a couple of weeks, and then moved to the Hotel Britannia, where they stayed until December. According to Mme. Monet, the Britannia had a view, \"if such a thing were possible, even more beautiful than that of Palazzo Barbaro...\" Monet painted looking out from this hotel, but not, it seems, in the case of this particular painting. Although the view from the hotel included the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, the painting appears to have been viewed from the waterfront known as the Riva degli Schiavoni, where the island forms a focal point of the view.\r Monet was reportedly reluctant to paint from the waterfront out of fear of conforming to other artists who were drawn to Venice, such as Renoir or Manet. San Giorgio Maggiore was a favorite subject for painters, including the proto-Impressionist Turner.\r Monet felt Venice was a city \"too beautiful to be painted\", which may be why he returned with many paintings unfinished to Giverny, his home in France. However, he had already retreated from his earlier practice of painting from life, in front of the subject. He worked on the Venetian scenes at home and the death of his wife Alice in 1911 seems to have been a factor in their completion. In 1912 he held a successful exhibition Claude Monet Venise at the gallery Bernheim-Jeune in Paris.\n", "\nArtist: Claude Monet\nArtwork Name: The Grand Canal 03\nArtwork Genre: cityscape\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet/the-grand-canal-03\n\nWikipedia Article:\nLe Grand Canal is an oil on canvas painting by French Impressionist painter Claude Monet (1840 - 1926). This painting is part of a series of paintings Monet undertook during 1908. This painting series en plein air, is a classic view of the Grand Canal, an attempt to capture the ever-changing face of Venice, as seen from the Palazzo Barbaro, where he stayed during his trip, was painted during a period that is generally regarded by art historians as the peak of his career. One of the paintings from this series of Venetian waterscapes by Claude Monet was sold for more than $35 million at 2015 Sotheby's auction. Sotheby's called this painting \"one of the most celebrated Venice paintings\". Previously it has been in the private collection of the New Orleans sugar magnate, Hunt Henderson, who was a noted art collector.\r This painting was undertaken on Monet's trip to Venice in the autumn of the year 1908, when the artist responded to an invitation from the American woman Mary Young Hunter, to visit her at the Palazzo Barbaro, in Venice. Monet was 68 years old this year. Hunter was a friend of Monet's wife, Alice, who invited the couple to come to visit her in Venice, where she rented this palazzo. Initially Monet was not keen but he did decide to travel. Monet and his wife arrived in Italy on October 1.\r While there Monet completed a series of artwork on the Canale Grande painting the same motif at different times of the day. Monet had the habit of studying the same subject in a varying light, at different times of the day, which resulted during his active career in many distinct Monet series, like for example the Water Lilies series, Poplar series, Rouen Cathedral series, Haystacks series and Charing Cross Bridge series. Monet painted 37 works of Venice during his three-month stay in Italy, from October to December, including this painting and five more depicting the same theme, Canale Grande. One is hosted at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.\r This painting depicts the view, from the Palazzo Barbaro. Monet\u2019s series introduced a fresh approach of a theme that was painted by many notable artist before him. The series are a pictorial exploration of the light upon the ancient city. The painter captured the sensations according to how the appearance of the motif changed as the light shifted on the water and its surroundings. The painter used the mooring-poles to counterbalance the buildings of the background including the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute. Monet was more preoccupied with capturing the light on the water and the sun rays reflections in this painting than the well known panoramas and sites or buildings in Venice, even if he stated that the city was very beautiful.\n", "\nArtist: Berthe Morisot\nArtwork Name: Summer's Day\nArtwork Genre: genre painting\nArtwork Media: canvas,oil\nWikiart URL: https://www.wikiart.org/en/berthe-morisot/summer-s-day-1879\n\nWikipedia Article:\nSummer's Day is a painting by French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot.

The painting was stolen from the Tate by two Irish students while it was on display there in order to protest the Lane Bequest. It was later returned after being left anonymously at the Irish Embassy.\r Morisot employed a rather unusual palette in this painting. She painted the dark blue coat of the woman on the right with cerulean blue which was rarely used by the Impressionists. The green foliage is painted in a mixture of emerald green, viridian, lead white and cadmium yellow.

Boldini also painted portraits of the Subercaseaux family.\r While Boldini's portraits of the Subercaseaux boys portray them conventionally as aware of the viewer, Zorn's portrait of the girls captures their private world, unaware of the viewer's gaze. To this end, Zorn adopts an unusual perspective, tilting the plane of the floor upwards and assuming the position of the girls himself.
