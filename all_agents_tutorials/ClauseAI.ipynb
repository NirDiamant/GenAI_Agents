    "## Contract Review Nodes Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines the key nodes in the workflow that perform tasks such as classifying contracts, retrieving clauses, generating review plans, and creating final reports. Each node plays a crucial role in the AI-driven contract analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Classify Contract**\n",
    "This node analyzes the contract to classify:\n",
    "- **Contract Type**: Identifies the type of contract (e.g., NDA, Employment Agreement, License Agreement).\n",
    "- **Industry**: Determines the relevant industry based on the context, if identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification provides a foundation for tailoring the subsequent review and analysis steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Retrieve Clauses**\n",
    "This node retrieves relevant clauses by:\n",
    "- Extracting **General Clauses** that apply universally.\n",
    "- Retrieving **Specific Clauses** related to the identified contract type.\n",
    "- Filtering clauses for **relevancy** using semantic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output includes formatted clauses for analysis and integration into the review workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Create Review Plan**\n",
    "Generates a detailed review plan based on the contract type and specific focus areas. Each step in the plan represents a legal role or perspective, such as:\n",
    "- Employment Law Specialist.\n",
    "- Compliance Officer.\n",
    "- Intellectual Property Counsel.\n",
    "- Financial Terms Analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "The review plan ensures a comprehensive and role-based approach to contract evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Execute Step**\n",
    "Executes a specific step from the review plan, focusing on:\n",
    "- Analyzing the contract from the perspective of a particular role.\n",
    "- Identifying and suggesting modifications with clear justifications.\n",
    "- Providing a summary of findings for that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative process progresses through all the steps defined in the review plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Execute Clause Analysis**\n",
    "This node evaluates individual clauses for clarity and completeness:\n",
    "- Checks if clauses are clearly represented and unambiguous.\n",
    "- Identifies missing elements or unclear language.\n",
    "- Suggests modifications if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that all critical clauses are accurate and appropriately integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Generate Final Report**\n",
    "Compiles a comprehensive report summarizing:\n",
    "- The contract's classification, objectives, and specific focus areas.\n",
    "- Key findings from the review steps and clause analysis.\n",
    "- Highlights of suggested modifications with legal justifications.\n",
    "- Compliance and risk assessment insights.\n",

    "These nodes collectively form an AI-powered workflow for contract analysis, ensuring:\n",
    "- Accurate classification of contracts.\n",
    "- Context-aware clause retrieval and review.\n",
    "- Comprehensive role-based evaluation.\n",
    "- Clear and actionable outputs for legal professionals.\n"

      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The contract does not include a 'Definitions' clause, which is essential for providing specific meanings for key terms used throughout the agreement. This omission could lead to misunderstandings or ambiguities regarding the interpretation of important terms. It is recommended to add a 'Definitions' section to ensure clarity and consistency in understanding the contract's terminology.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The \"Entire Agreement\" clause in the Microsoft Employment Agreement is clearly represented. It states that the agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the employee's employment and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and representations. This aligns with the key elements of an \"Entire Agreement\" clause, which is to declare that the written agreement is the complete and final understanding between the parties, superseding all prior negotiations and agreements. The language used is clear and unambiguous, and no modifications are necessary.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The contract does not contain a specific Severability clause. The description provided is a general explanation of what a Severability clause should entail, but it is not included in the actual contract text. To ensure clarity and enforceability, a specific Severability clause should be added to the contract. The suggested modification provides a clear and standard version of a Severability clause that can be included in the contract.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The clause titled \"Amendments\" in the provided Microsoft Employment Agreement is clearly represented. It specifies that any amendments to the agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties, which aligns with the standard requirements for contract modifications. The language used is clear and unambiguous, ensuring that both parties understand the necessity of written and signed amendments for any changes to be valid. No modifications are necessary as the clause is complete and clearly articulated.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The Governing Law clause in the Microsoft Employment Agreement is clearly represented. It specifies that the agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. This is a standard and clear statement that identifies the jurisdiction whose laws will apply to the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement. No modifications are necessary as the clause is complete and unambiguous.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The contract does not contain a specific 'Notices' clause. The description provided is vague and lacks detail on the methods of delivery, addresses, and timeframes for notices, which are essential components of a clear Notices clause. Without these details, the clause is not clearly represented in the contract. It is recommended to include a detailed Notices clause specifying the acceptable methods of delivery (e.g., email, postal mail), the addresses to which notices should be sent, and any required timeframes for delivery.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The Force Majeure clause is not present in the provided Microsoft Employment Agreement. The clause is generally clear in its intent to release parties from liability due to extraordinary events beyond their control. However, it could benefit from a more detailed list of potential events that qualify as force majeure to avoid ambiguity. Including examples such as acts of God, government actions, pandemics, or other significant disruptions would enhance clarity and comprehensiveness.\n",
      "- ### Clause Analysis\n",
      "The contract provided does not contain an explicit 'Assignment' clause. The description provided in the task is not present in the contract text. To ensure clarity and enforceability, an 'Assignment' clause should be explicitly included in the contract. The suggested modification provides a clear and unambiguous statement of the assignment restriction, which is currently missing from the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highlights of Suggested Modifications:\n",
      "--------------------------------------\n",
      "The modifications to the contract focus on enhancing clarity, compliance, and enforceability from a legal perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Definitions Section**: The contract lacks a 'Definitions' section, which is crucial for clarifying key terms used throughout the agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Severability Clause**: The original text describes a severability clause but lacks the actual language. The modification provides a standard clause to ensure enforceability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Notices Clause**: The original text is vague about delivery methods and timeframes for formal communications. The modification specifies acceptable methods, addresses, and timeframes for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Force Majeure Clause**: The original text is vague about extraordinary events. The modification includes examples like acts of God, government actions, and pandemics to prevent ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Assignment Restriction**: The original text describes the clause but lacks clarity. The modification provides a direct statement restricting assignment without consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **At-Will Employment**: The modification clarifies that at-will employment is subject to all applicable laws, which may impose restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Non-Compete Clause**: Modifications ensure the clause is reasonable and enforceable by defining 'competing business' and limiting geographic scope, complying with local laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Severance Benefits**: The modification clarifies conditions for severance benefits, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Non-Solicitation Clause**: Ensures compliance with applicable law by specifying reasonable scope and duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Confidentiality Obligation**: Specifies the duration of confidentiality post-employment, strengthening protection of confidential information.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Intellectual Property**: Clarifies the scope of what is related to Microsoft's business and exceptions for independently developed inventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **NDA Incorporation**: Incorporates the NDA by reference into the agreement, providing a comprehensive legal framework for confidentiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Data Protection Compliance**: Modifications ensure compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) by explicitly mentioning personal data handling and obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **Salary and Bonus Clarity**: Specifies salary payment frequency and includes performance metrics for bonuses, providing transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Equity Awards and Relocation**: Clarifies conditions for equity awards and relocation assistance, aligning with standard practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. **Governing Law**: Acknowledges compliance with data protection laws in all jurisdictions, not just state law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these modifications aim to reduce legal risks, prevent disputes, and ensure the contract is comprehensive and enforceable.\n",
      "\n",
