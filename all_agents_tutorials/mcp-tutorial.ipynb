    "# Building an Agent with MCP: Seamless Integration of AI and External Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through implementing MCP in your AI agent applications, demonstrating how it can enhance your agents' capabilities by providing seamless access to external resources, tools, and data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why MCP Matters for Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of connecting AI models with external resources often involve custom integrations for each data source or tool. This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration Complexity**: Each new data source requires a unique implementation\n",
    "- **Scalability Issues**: Adding new tools becomes progressively harder\n",
    "- **Maintenance Overhead**: Updates to one integration may break others\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP solves these challenges by providing a standardized protocol that enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified Access**: A single interface for multiple data sources and tools\n",
    "- **Plug-and-Play Extensions**: Easy addition of new capabilities\n",
    "- **Stateful Communication**: Real-time, two-way communication between AI and resources\n",
    "- **Dynamic Discovery**: AI can find and use new tools on the fly\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concise paragraph highlighting the official MCP Server examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Official MCP Server Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP community maintains a collection of reference server implementations that showcase best practices and demonstrate various integration patterns. These official examples, available at [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src), provide valuable starting points for developers looking to create their own MCP servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build Your MCP Servers and Use It**: Build a MCP server with customized tools and connect to Claude Desktop\n",
    "2. **Customized Tool-Enabled Agent**: Create an customized agent that can use external tools via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how MCP can enhance your AI agents by providing them with access to the broader digital ecosystem, making them more capable, context-aware, and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding the MCP architecture and setting up our environment!"

    "## MCP Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "![MCP Architecture](../images/mcp_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP follows a client-server architecture with three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Host**: The AI application (like Claude Desktop, Cursor or a customized agent) that needs access to external resources\n",
    "- **Clients**: Connectors that maintain connections with servers\n",
    "- **Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose capabilities (data, tools, prompts) via the MCP protocol\n",
    "- **Data Sources**: Both local (files, databases) and remote services (APIs) that MCP servers can access\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication within MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket connections, ensuring real-time, bidirectional communication between components."
