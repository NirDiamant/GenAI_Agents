    "For knowledge retrieval, this tutorial uses [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) which is knowledge graph based RAG implementation. Compared to GraphRAG, LightRAG is more accurate for single topic datasets, and uses 1,000x less tokens for retrieval. Furthermore, documents can be added to LightRAG incrementally without rebuilding the knowledge graph. See the full results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05779).\n",

      "Down on His Luck is an 1889 painting by the Australian artist Frederick McCubbin. It depicts a seemingly disheartened swagman, sitting by a campfire sadly brooding over his misfortune. According to an 1889 review, \"The face tells of hardships, keen and blighting in their influence, but there is a nonchalant and slightly cynical expression, which proclaims the absence of all self-pity ... McCubbin's picture is thoroughly Australian in spirit.\" The surrounding bush is painted in subdued tones, reflecting his somber and contemplative mood.\r The artist's model was Louis Abrahams, a friend and successful tobaccanist in Melbourne who earlier supplied the cigar box lids for the famous 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition. The scene was staged near the Box Hill artists' camp outside Melbourne, but it is thought that McCubbin would have made additional studies of Abrahams under studio conditions.\r The painting was owned by William Fergusson up to 1986 until it was purchased by the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth.\n",

The artwork is characterized by its vibrant colors and dynamic brushwork, showcasing a bustling Parisian atmosphere filled with elegantly dressed figures. The scene reflects the warmth and vitality of the season, as pedestrians stroll under the trees, with the blooming flowers adding to the picturesque backdrop.

Renoir's work serves as a snapshot of Parisian life during the late 19th century, celebrating leisure, fashion, and the social dynamics of its bourgeois class. The painting serves not only as an artistic expression of the Impressionist movement but also as a cultural reflection of the societal changes occurring in Paris at the time, where art and life intertwine amidst the lively urban scene.\",\n",
