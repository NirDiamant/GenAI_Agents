        "1. **Scenario-Based Testing**\n",
        "   - **Input**: Accepts a predefined scenario (e.g., `\"high\"` severity).\n",
        "   - **Data Simulation**: Uses `get_simulated_weather_data(scenario)` to initialize a test state with relevant simulated weather data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Workflow Execution**\n",
        "   - **Process**: Executes the workflow using `app.invoke` with the test state.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Validates the system's functionality in handling the simulated scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Result Logging**\n",
        "   - **Logs**: Captures and records the results of the test run.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Provides insights into system behavior and outcomes for debugging or evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Error Handling**\n",
        "   - **Graceful Management**: Catches and manages errors during the test run.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: Ensures uninterrupted testing and meaningful error reports.\n",
