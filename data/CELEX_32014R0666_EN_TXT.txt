COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 666/
```
```
of 12 March 2014
establishing substantive requirements for a Union inventory system and taking into account
changes in the global warming potentials and internationally agreed inventory guidelines pursuant
to Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council
```
```
(Text with EEA relevance)

```
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
```
```
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
```
```
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a
mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and
Union level relevant to climate change and repealing Decision No 280/2004/EC (^1 ), and in particular Article 6(2) and
Article 7(6)(b) thereof,
```
```
Whereas:
```
```
(1) The mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to enable the assessment of
the actual progress towards meeting the Union's and the Member States' commitments relating to the limitation
or reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) approved by Council Decision 94/69/EC (^2 ), its Kyoto Protocol approved by Council Decision
2002/358/EC (^3 ) and the set of Union legal acts, adopted in 2009, collectively referred to as the ‘Climate and
Energy Package’.
```
```
(2) Decision 19/CMP.1 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC serving as the meeting of the Parties to the
Kyoto Protocol lays down the guidelines for national systems the Parties should apply. The rules on the Union
inventory system should therefore be specified in order to fulfil the obligations pursuant to that Decision,
ensuring the timeliness, transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability and completeness of reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC Secretariat.
```
```
(3) To ensure the quality of the Union inventory system, it is necessary to establish further rules on the Union green­
house gas inventory quality assurance and quality control programme.
```
```
(4) In order to ensure completeness of the Union's inventory in accordance with the guidelines for preparing the
national greenhouse gas inventories it is necessary to provide for the methodologies and the data to be used by
the Commission when, in consultation and close cooperation with the Member State concerned, preparing esti­
mates for data missing from a Member State inventory pursuant to Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013.
```
```
(5) In order to ensure the timely and effective implementation of Union's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol of the
UNFCCC it is necessary to set the timescales for cooperation and coordination during the annual reporting
process and the UNFCCC review between Member States and the Union.
```
```
(6) Account should be taken of changes in the global warming potential values and internationally agreed guidelines
for national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks in accordance with relevant
decisions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.
```
```
(7) In order to ensure consistency with the implementation of monitoring and reporting requirements under the
UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2015,

removals by sinks for the territory of the European Union in accordance with Article 52 of the Treaty on European
Union and is established on the basis of the Member States' greenhouse gas inventories, as reported pursuant to Article 7
of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, for the complete time series of inventory years.
2. This Regulation lays down rules on the requirements for a Union inventory system, further specifying rules on the
preparation and administration of the Union greenhouse gas inventory including rules on cooperation with the Member
States during the annual reporting process and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) inventory review.
3. This Regulation also lays down rules with regard to the global warming potential values and the internationally
agreed inventory guidelines to be used by the Member States and the Commission in the determination and reporting of
the greenhouse gas inventory.

lation (EU) No 525/2013;
```
```
(b) that the Union greenhouse gas inventory provides a transparent aggregation of Member States' greenhouse gas emis­
sions and removals by sinks and reflects in a transparent manner the contribution of Member States' emissions and
removals by sinks to the Union greenhouse gas inventory;
```
```
(c) that the total of the Union's greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks for a reporting year is equal to the
sum of Member States' greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks reported pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 5 of
Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 for that same year;
```
```
(d) that the Union greenhouse gas inventory includes a consistent time series of emissions and removals by sinks for all
reported years.
```
2. The Commission and the Member States shall strive to increase the comparability of Member States' greenhouse
gas inventories.

Gap filling
```
1. The Commission estimates for data missing from a Member State's greenhouse gas inventory as referred to in
Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 shall be based on the following methodologies and data:

```
(a) where a Member State has submitted in the previous reporting year a consistent time series of estimates for the rele­
vant source category that has not been subject to adjustments under Article 5(2) of the Kyoto Protocol and any of
the following occurs:
```
```
(i) that Member State has submitted an approximated greenhouse gas inventory for the year X – 1 pursuant to
Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 that includes the missing estimate, on the data from that approxi­
mated greenhouse gas inventory;
```
```
(ii) that Member State has not submitted an approximated greenhouse gas inventory for the year X – 1 under
Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, but the Union has estimated approximated greenhouse gas emis­
sions for the year X – 1 for the Member States in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 525/2013, on the data from that Union approximated greenhouse gas inventory;
```
```
(iii) the use of the data from the approximated greenhouse gas inventory is not possible or may lead to a highly
inaccurate estimation, for missing estimates in the energy sector, on the data obtained in accordance with Regu­
lation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (^1 );
```
```
(iv) the use of the data from the approximated greenhouse gas inventory is not possible or may lead to a highly
inaccurate estimation, for missing estimates in non-energy sectors, on estimation based on the technical
guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5(2) of the Kyoto Protocol without application of the
conservativeness factor defined in that guidance.
```
```
(b) where an estimate for the relevant source category was subject to adjustments under Article 5(2) of the Kyoto
Protocol in previous years and the Member State concerned has not submitted a revised estimate, on the basic adjust­
ment method used by the expert review team as set out in the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments
under Article 5(2) of the Kyoto Protocol without application of the conservativeness factor defined in that guidance;
```
```
(c) where an estimate for the relevant category was subject to technical corrections under point (c) of Article 19(3) of
Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 in previous years and the Member State concerned has not submitted a revised esti­
mate, on the method used by the technical expert review team to calculate the technical correction;
```
```
(d) where a consistent time series of reported estimates for the relevant source category is not available and the estimate
of the source category has not been subject to adjustments under Article 5(2) of the Kyoto Protocol, on the technical
guidance for adjustments, without application of the conservativeness factor defined in that guidance.
```
2. The Commission shall prepare the estimates referred to in paragraph 1 by 31 March of the reporting year in
consultation with the Member State concerned.
3. The Member State concerned shall use the estimates referred to in paragraph 1 for its national submission to the
UNFCCC Secretariat of 15 April to ensure consistency between the Union greenhouse gas inventory and the Member
States' greenhouse gas inventories.
