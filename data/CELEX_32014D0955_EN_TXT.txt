2. ‘heavy metal’ selenium, tellurium, thallium means any compoand tin, as well as these materials in metallic und of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium form, as far as these are classified (VI), copper, lead, mercury, nickel, as hazar­
    dous substances;

3. ‘polychlorinated biphenyls Directive 96/59/EC ( (^1) ); and polychlorinated terphenyls’ (‘PCBs’) means PCBs as defined in Article 2(a) of Council

4. ‘transition copper, yttrium, niobium, metals’ means any of the following metals: hafnium, tungsten, titanium, any compound chromium, iron, nickel, zinc, zirconium, of scandium, vanadium, manganesemolybdenum , cobalt, and

5. ‘stabilisation’ dous waste into non-hazardous means processes which waste; change the hazardousness of the constituents in the waste and transform hazar­
6. ‘solidification’ the chemical propermeans ties of the waste; processes which only change the physical state of the waste by using additives without changing
7. ‘partly stabilised not been changed completely into non-hazardous wastes’ means wastes containing, after the stabilisation constituents and could be released process, hazardous into the environment constituents which in the have

LIST OF WASTE
The different types of waste in the list are fully defined by the six-digit and four-digit chapter headings. This implies that the following steps should code for the waste and the respective be taken to identify a waste in the list: two-digit
— Identify of the waste (excluding the source generating codes ending the waste in Chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20 and identify with 99 of these chapters). Note that a specific production the appropriate six-digit unit may need to code
classify (wastes from shaping its activities in several and surface chapters. For instance, treatment of metals), a car manufacturer 11 (inorganic wastes containing may find its wastes metals from metal treatment listed in Chapters 12
and the coating of metals) and 08 (wastes from the use of coatings), depending on the different process steps.
— If no approprexamined to identify iate waste code can be found in Chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20, the Chapters 13, 14 and 15 must be the waste.
— If none of these waste codes apply, the waste must be identified according to Chapter 16.
— If the waste is not in Chapter 16 either, the 99 code (wastes not otherwise specified) the list corresponding to the activity identified in step one. must be used in the section of
