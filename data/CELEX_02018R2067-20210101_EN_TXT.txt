Reliability of verification
```
## ▼M

```
A verified emissions report, tonne-kilometre report, baseline data report,
new entrant data report or annual activity level report shall be reliable
for users. It shall represent faithfully that, which it either purports to
represent or may reasonably be expected to represent.
```
## ▼B

```
The process of verifying operator's or aircraft operator's report shall be
an effective and reliable tool in support of quality assurance and quality
control procedures, providing information upon which an operator or
aircraft operator can act to improve performance in monitoring and
reporting emissions or data relevant for free allocation.
```
## ▼B


```
Article 7
```
```
General obligations of the verifier
```
1. The verifier shall carry out the verification and the activities
required by this Chapter with the aim of providing a verification
report that concludes with reasonable assurance that the operator's or
aircraft operator's report is free from material misstatements.
2. The verifier shall plan and perform the verification with an attitude
of professional scepticism, recognising that circumstances may exist that
cause the information in the operator's or aircraft operator's report to
contain material misstatements.
3. The verifier must carry out verification in the public interest, and
be independent of the operator or aircraft operator and the competent
authorities responsible for Directive 2003/87/EC.
4. During the verification, the verifier shall assess whether:

## ▼M

```
(a) the operator’s or aircraft operator’s report is complete and meets
the requirements laid down in Annex X to Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, in Annex IV to Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2019/331 or Article 3(2) of Implementing Regu­
lation (EU) 2019/1842, as appropriate;
```
## ▼B

```
(b) the operator or aircraft operator has acted in compliance with the
requirements of the greenhouse gas emissions permit and the moni­
toring plan approved by the competent authority, where the verifi­
cation of an operator's emission report is concerned, and with the
requirements of the monitoring plan approved by the competent
authority, where the verification of an aircraft operator's emission
or tonne-kilometre report is concerned;
```
## ▼M

```
(c) where the verification of an operator’s baseline data report, new
entrant data report or annual activity level report is concerned, the
operator has acted in conformance with the requirements of the
monitoring methodology plan pursuant to Article 8 of Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2019/331 approved by the competent authority;
```
## ▼B

```
(d) the data in the operator's or aircraft operator's report are free from
material misstatements;
```
```
(e) information can be provided in support of the operator's or aircraft
operator's data flow activities, control system and associated
procedures to improve the performance of their monitoring and
reporting.
```
## ▼B


```
By way of derogation from point (c), the verifier shall assess whether
the operator's monitoring methodology plan is in compliance with the
requirements of Delegated Regulation (EU) ►M1 2019/331 ◄ where
the monitoring methodology plan is not subject to approval of the
competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report. If
the verifier discovers that a monitoring methodology plan does not
comply with Delegated Regulation (EU) ►M1 2019/331 ◄, the
operator shall modify the monitoring methodology plan so that it
complies with that Regulation.
```
```
For the purpose of point (d) of this paragraph, the verifier shall obtain
clear and objective evidence from the operator or aircraft operator to
support the reported aggregated emissions, tonne-kilometres or data
relevant for free allocation taking into account all other information
provided in the operator's or aircraft operator's report.
```
## ▼M

5. If the verifier discovers that an operator or an aircraft operator is
not complying with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 or the
operator is not complying with, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 or
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1842, that irregularity shall be
included in the verification report even if the monitoring plan or moni­
toring methodology plan concerned, as appropriate, has been approved
by the competent authority.

## ▼B

6. If the monitoring plan has not been approved by the competent
authority pursuant to Article 12 of Implementing Regulation (EU)
2018/2066, is incomplete or if significant modifications referred to in
Article 15(3) or (4) of that Implementing Regulation have been made
during the reporting period which have not been accordingly approved
by the competent authority, the verifier shall advise the operator or
aircraft operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent
authority.

```
If the monitoring methodology plan is subject to the approval of the
competent authority prior to submission of the baseline data report
pursuant to Article 8(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU)
►M1 2019/331 ◄ and the monitoring methodology plan has not
been approved or is incomplete, or where significant modifications
referred to in Article 9(5) of that Regulation have been made which
have not been approved by the competent authority, the verifier shall
advise the operator to obtain the necessary approval from the competent
authority.
```
```
Following the approval by the competent authority, the verifier shall
continue, repeat or adapt the verification activities accordingly.
```
```
If the approval has not been obtained before the issue of the verification
report, the verifier shall report this in the verification report.
```
```
