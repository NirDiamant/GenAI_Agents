# Completeness

# Monitoring and reporting shall be complete and cover all process and

# combustion emissions from all emission sources and source streams

# belonging to activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC and

# other relevant activities included pursuant to Article 24 of that Directive,

# and of all greenhouse gases specified in relation to those activities,

# while avoiding double-counting.

# Operators and aircraft operators shall take appropriate measures to

# prevent any data gaps within the reporting period.

# Article 6

# Consistency, comparability and transparency

# 1. Monitoring and reporting shall be consistent and comparable over

# time. To that end, operators and aircraft operators shall use the same

# monitoring methodologies and data sets, subject to changes and dero­

# gations approved by the competent authority.

# 2. Operators and aircraft operators shall obtain, record, compile,

# analyse and document monitoring data, including assumptions, refer­

# ences, activity data and calculation factors, in a transparent manner

# that enables the reproduction of the determination of emissions by the

# verifier and the competent authority.

# Article 7

# Accuracy

# Operators and aircraft operators shall ensure that emission determination

# is neither systematically nor knowingly inaccurate.

# They shall identify and reduce any source of inaccuracies as far as

# possible.

# (h) a change to the default value for a calculation factor, where the

# value is to be laid down in the monitoring plan;

# (i) the introduction of new methods or changes to existing methods

# related to sampling, analysis or calibration, where this has a direct

# impact on the accuracy of emissions data;

# (j) the implementation or adaption of a quantification methodology for

# emissions from leakage at storage sites.

# 4. Significant changes to the monitoring plans of an aircraft operator

# include:

# (a) with regard to the emission monitoring plan:

# (i) a change of emission factor values laid down in the monitoring

# plan;

# (ii) a change between calculation methods as laid down in Annex

# III, or a change from the use of a calculation method to the use

# of estimation methodology in accordance with Article 55(2) or

# vice versa ;

# (iii) the introduction of new source streams;

# (iv) changes in the status of the aircraft operator as a small emitter

# 2003/87/EC;

# (b) with regard to the tonne-kilometre data monitoring plan:

# (i) a change between a non-commercial and commercial status of

# (ii) a change in the object of the air transport service, the object

# being passengers, freight or mail.

# Article 16

# Implementation and record-keeping of modifications

# 1. Before receiving approval or information in accordance with

# Article 15(2), the operator or aircraft operator may carry out monitoring

# and reporting using the modified monitoring plan where it can

# reasonably assume that the proposed modifications are not significant,

# or where monitoring in accordance with the original monitoring plan

# would lead to incomplete emission data.

# ▼B


# In case of doubt, the operator or aircraft operator shall use in parallel

# both the modified and the original monitoring plan to carry out all

# monitoring and reporting in accordance with both plans, and it shall

# keep records of both monitoring results.

# ▼B

# 2. Upon receipt of approval or information in accordance with

# Article 15(2), the operator or aircraft operator shall only use the data

# relating to the modified monitoring plan and carry out all monitoring

# and reporting using only the modified monitoring plan from the date

# from which that version of the monitoring plan is applicable.

# 3. The operator or aircraft operator shall keep records of all modifi­

# cations of the monitoring plan. Each record shall contain:

# (a) a transparent description of the modification;

# (b) a justification for the modification;

# (c) the date of notification of the modification to the competent

# authority pursuant to Article 15(1);

# (d) the date on which the competent authority acknowledged receipt of

# the notification referred to in Article 15(1), where available, and the

# date of the approval or information referred to in Article 15(2);

# (e) the starting date of implementation of the modified monitoring plan

# in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.

# SECTION 2

# Technical feasibility and unreasonable costs

# Article 17

# Technical feasibility

# Where an operator or aircraft operator claims that applying a specific

# monitoring methodology is technically not feasible, the competent

# authority shall assess the technical feasibility taking the operator's or

# aircraft operator's justification into account. That justification shall be

# based on the operator or aircraft operator having technical resources

# capable of meeting the needs of a proposed system or requirement

# that can be implemented in the required time for the purposes of this

# Regulation. Those technical resources shall include the availability of

# the requisite techniques and technology.

# Article 18

# Unreasonable costs

# 1. Where an operator or aircraft operator claims that applying a

# specific monitoring methodology would incur unreasonable costs, the

# competent authority shall assess whether the costs are unreasonable,

# taking into account the operator's justification.

# ▼M


# The competent authority shall consider costs unreasonable where the

# cost estimate exceeds the benefit. To that end, the benefit shall be

# calculated by multiplying an improvement factor by a reference price

# of EUR 20 per allowance and costs shall include an appropriate

# depreciation period based on the economic lifetime of the equipment.

# 2. When assessing the unreasonable nature of the costs with regard to

# the operator's choice of tier levels for activity data, the competent

# authority shall use as the improvement factor referred to in paragraph

# 1 the difference between the uncertainty currently achieved and the

# uncertainty threshold of the tier that would be achieved by the

# improvement multiplied by the average annual emissions caused by

# that source stream over the three most recent years.

# In the absence of such data on the average annual emissions caused by

# that source stream over the three most recent years, the operator or

# aircraft operator shall provide a conservative estimate of the annual

# average emissions, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass

# and before subtraction of transferred CO 2. For measuring instruments

# under national legal metrological control, the uncertainty currently

# achieved may be substituted by the maximum permissible error in

# service allowed by the relevant national legislation.

# 3. When assessing the unreasonable nature of the costs with regard to

# measures increasing the quality of reported emissions but without direct

# impact on the accuracy of activity data, the competent authority shall

# use an improvement factor of 1 % of the average annual emissions of

# the respective source streams in the three most recent reporting

# periods. Those measures may include:

# (a) switching from default values to analyses to determine calculation

# factors;

# (b) an increase of the number of analyses per source stream;

# (c) where the specific measuring task does not fall under national legal

# metrological control, the substitution of measuring instruments with

# instruments complying with relevant requirements of legal metro­

# logical control of the Member State in similar applications, or to

# measuring instruments meeting national rules adopted pursuant to

# Directive 2014/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Coun­

# cil ( 1 ) or Directive 2014/32/EU;

# (d) shortening calibration and maintenance intervals of measuring

# instruments;

# (e) improvements to data-flow activities and control activities that

# significantly reduce the inherent or control risk.

# 4. Measures relating to the improvement of an installation's moni­

# toring methodology shall not be deemed to incur unreasonable costs up

# to an accumulated amount of EUR 2 000 per reporting period. For

# installations with low emissions that threshold shall be EUR 500 per

# reporting period.

## CHAPTER III

## MONITORING OF EMISSIONS FROM STATIONARY INSTAL­

## LATIONS

# SECTION 1

# General provisions

# Article 19

# Categorisation of installations, source streams and emission sources

# 1. For the purpose of monitoring emissions and determining the

# minimum requirements for tiers, each operator shall determine the

# category of its installation pursuant to paragraph 2, and, where

# relevant, of each source stream pursuant to paragraph 3 and of each

# emission source pursuant to paragraph 4.

# 2. The operator shall classify each installation in one of the following

# categories:

# (a) a category A installation, where the average verified annual

# emissions in the trading period immediately preceding the current

# trading period, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass

# and before subtraction of transferred CO 2 , are equal to or less than

50 000 tonnes of CO (^) 2(e);

# (b) a category B installation, where the average verified annual

# emissions of the trading period immediately preceding the current

# trading period, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass

# and before subtraction of transferred CO 2 , are more than 50 000

tonnes of CO (^) 2(e) and equal to or less than 500 000 tonnes of CO (^) 2(e) ;

# (c) a category C installation, where the average verified annual

# emissions of the trading period immediately preceding the current

# trading period, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass

# and before subtraction of transferred CO 2 , are more than 500 000

tonnes of CO (^) 2(e).

# By way of derogation from Article 14(2), the competent authority may

# allow the operator not to modify the monitoring plan where, on the

# basis of verified emissions, the threshold for the classification of the

# installation referred to in the first subparagraph is exceeded, but the

# operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority

# that this threshold has not already been exceeded within the past

# five reporting periods and will not be exceeded again in subsequent

# reporting periods.

# 3. The operator shall classify each source stream in one of the

# following categories, comparing it against the sum of all absolute

values of fossil CO 2 and CO (^) 2(e) corresponding to all source streams

# included in calculation-based methodologies and of all emissions of

# emission sources monitored using measurement-based methodologies,

# before subtraction of transferred CO 2 :

# ▼B


# (a) minor source streams, where the source streams selected by the

operator jointly account for less than 5 000 tonnes of fossil CO (^2)

# per year or less than 10 %, up to a total maximum of 100 000

# tonnes of fossil CO 2 per year, whichever is greater in terms of

# absolute value;

# (b) de minimis source streams, where the source streams selected by the

# operator jointly account for less than 1 000 tonnes of fossil CO 2 per

# year or less than 2 %, up to a total maximum of 20 000 tonnes of

# fossil CO 2 per year, whichever is greater in terms of absolute value;

# (c) major source streams, where the source streams do not fall within

# the categories referred to in points (a) and (b).

# By way of derogation from Article 14(2), the competent authority may

# allow the operator not to modify the monitoring plan where, on the

# basis of verified emissions, the threshold for the classification of a

# source stream as a minor source stream or a de minimis source

# stream referred to in the first subparagraph is exceeded, but the

# operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority

# that this threshold has not already been exceeded within the past five

# reporting periods and will not be exceeded again in subsequent

# reporting periods.

# 4. The operator shall classify each emission source for which a

# measurement-based methodology is applied in one of the following

# categories:

# (a) minor emission sources, where the emission source emits less than

5 000 tonnes of fossil CO (^) 2(e) per year or less than 10 % of the

# installation's total fossil emissions, up to a maximum of 100 000

tonnes of fossil CO (^) 2(e) per year, whichever is greater in terms of

# absolute value;

# (b) major emission sources, where the emission source does not classify

# as a minor emission source.

# By way of derogation from Article 14(2), the competent authority may

# allow the operator not to modify the monitoring plan where, on the

# basis of verified emissions, the threshold for the classification of an

# emission source as a minor emission source referred to in the first

# subparagraph is exceeded, but the operator demonstrates to the satis­

# faction of the competent authority that this threshold has not already

# been exceeded within the past five reporting periods and will not be

# exceeded again in subsequent reporting periods.

# 5. Where the average annual verified emissions in the trading period

# immediately preceding the current trading period for the installation are

# not available or no longer representative for the purpose of paragraph 2,

# the operator shall use a conservative estimate of annual average

# emissions, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass and

# before subtraction of transferred CO 2 , to determine the category of

# the installation.

# Article 20

# Monitoring boundaries

# 1. Operators shall define the monitoring boundaries for each instal­

# lation.

# ▼B


# Within those boundaries, the operator shall include all relevant

# greenhouse gas emissions from all emission sources and source

# streams belonging to activities carried out at the installation and listed

# in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, and from activities and greenhouse

# gases included by the Member State in which the installation is situated,

# pursuant to Article 24 of that Directive.

# The operator shall also include emissions from regular operations and

# abnormal events, including start-up, shut-down and emergency situ­

# ations, over the reporting period, with the exception of emissions

# from mobile machinery for transportation purposes.

# 2. When determining the monitoring and reporting process, the

# operator shall include the sector-specific requirements laid down in

# Annex IV.

# 3. Where leakages from a storage complex within the meaning of

# Directive 2009/31/EC are identified and lead to emissions or release of

# CO 2 to the water column, they shall be considered as emission sources

# for the installation in question and shall be monitored in accordance

# with section 23 of Annex IV to this Regulation.

# The competent authority may allow the exclusion of a leakage emission

# source from the monitoring and reporting process, once corrective

# measures pursuant to Article 16 of Directive 2009/31/EC have been

# taken and emissions or release into the water column from that

# leakage can no longer be detected.

# Article 21

# Choice of the monitoring methodology

# 1. For the monitoring of the emissions of an installation, the operator

# shall choose to apply either a calculation-based methodology or a

# measurement-based methodology, subject to specific provisions of this

# Regulation.

# A calculation-based methodology shall consist in determining emissions

# from source streams on the basis of activity data obtained by means of

# measurement systems and additional parameters from laboratory

# analyses or default values. The calculation-based methodology may be

# implemented according to the standard methodology set out in Article 24

# or the mass-balance methodology set out in Article 25.

# A measurement-based methodology shall consist in determining

# emissions from emission sources by means of continuous measurement

# of the concentration of the relevant greenhouse gas in the flue gas and

# of the flue-gas flow, including the monitoring of CO 2 transfers between

# installations where the CO 2 concentration and the flow of the transferred

# gas are measured.

# Where the calculation-based methodology is applied, the operator shall

# determine for each source stream, in the monitoring plan, whether the

# standard methodology or the mass-balance methodology is used,

# including the relevant tiers in accordance with Annex II.

# ▼B


# 2. Subject to approval by the competent authority, the operator may

# combine standard methodology, mass-balance and measurement-based

# methodologies for different emission sources and source streams

# belonging to one installation, provided that neither gaps nor double

# counting concerning emissions occur.

# 3. Where sector-specific requirements laid down in Annex IV require

# the use of a specific monitoring methodology, the operator shall use that

# methodology or a measurement-based methodology. The operator may

# choose a different methodology only if it provides the competent

# authority with evidence that the use of the required methodology is

# technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs, or that the alter­

# native methodology leads to a higher overall accuracy of emissions data.

# Article 22

# Monitoring methodology not based on tiers

# By way of derogation from Article 21(1), the operator may use a

# monitoring methodology that is not based on tiers (hereinafter ‘the

# fall-back methodology’) for selected source streams or emission

# sources, provided that all of the following conditions are met:

# (a) applying at least tier 1 under the calculation-based methodology for

# one or more major source streams or minor source streams and a

# measurement-based methodology for at least one emission source

# related to the same source streams is technically not feasible or

# would incur unreasonable costs;

# (b) the operator assesses and quantifies each year the uncertainties of all

# parameters used for the determination of the annual emissions in

# accordance with the ISO guide to the expression of uncertainty in

# measurement (JCGM 100:2008) or another equivalent inter­

# nationally accepted standard, and includes the results in the

# annual emissions report;

# (c) the operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent

# authority that by applying such a fall-back monitoring methodology,

# the overall uncertainty thresholds for the annual level of greenhouse

# gas emissions for the whole installation do not exceed 7,5 % for

# category A installations, 5,0 % for category B installations and

# 2,5 % for category C installations.

# Article 23

# Temporary changes to the monitoring methodology

# 1. Where it is for technical reasons temporarily not feasible to apply

# the monitoring plan as approved by the competent authority, the

# operator concerned shall apply the highest achievable tier, or a conser­

# vative no-tier approach if application of a tier is not achievable, until the

# conditions for application of the tier approved in the monitoring plan

# have been restored.

# ▼B


# The operator shall take all necessary measures to allow the prompt

# resumption of the application of the monitoring plan as approved by

# the competent authority.

# 2. The operator concerned shall notify the competent authority of the

# temporary change referred to in paragraph 1 to the monitoring

# methodology without undue delay to the competent authority, spec­

# ifying:

# (a) the reasons for deviating from the monitoring plan as approved by

# the competent authority;

# (b) the details of the interim monitoring methodology that the operator

# is using to determine the emissions until the conditions for the

# application of the monitoring plan as approved by the competent

# authority have been restored;

# (c) the measures the operator is taking to restore the conditions for the

# application of the monitoring plan as approved by the competent

# authority;

# (d) the anticipated point in time when application of the monitoring

# plan as approved by the competent authority will be resumed.

# SECTION 2

# Calculation-based methodology

# S u b s e c t i o n 1

# G e n e r a l

# Article 24

# Calculation of emissions under the standard methodology

# 1. Under the standard methodology, the operator shall calculate

# combustion emissions source stream by multiplying the activity data

# related to the amount of fuel combusted, expressed as terajoules

# based on net calorific value (NCV), by the corresponding emission

# factor, expressed as tonnes of CO 2 per terajoule (t CO 2 /TJ) consistent

# with the use of NCV, and the corresponding oxidation factor.

# The competent authority may allow the use of emission factors for fuels

# expressed as t CO 2 /t or t CO 2 /Nm 3. In such cases, the operator shall

# determine combustion emissions by multiplying the activity data related

# to the amount of fuel combusted, expressed as tonnes or normal cubic

# metres, by the corresponding emission factor and the corresponding

# oxidation factor.

# 2. The operator shall determine process emissions per source stream

# by multiplying the activity data related to the material consumption,

# throughput or production output, expressed in tonnes or normal cubic

# metres, by the corresponding emission factor, expressed in t CO 2 /t or

# t CO 2 /Nm 3 , and the corresponding conversion factor.

# 3. Where a tier 1 or tier 2 emission factor already includes the effect

# of incomplete chemical reactions, the oxidation factor or conversion

# factor shall be set to 1.

# ▼B


# Article 25

# Calculation of emissions under the mass balance methodology

# 1. Under the mass balance methodology, the operator shall calculate

# the quantity of CO 2 corresponding to each source stream included in the

# mass balance by multiplying the activity data related to the amount of

# fuel or material entering or leaving the boundaries of the mass balance,

# with the fuel's or material's carbon content multiplied by 3,664 t CO 2 /t C,

# applying section 3 of Annex II.

# 2. Notwithstanding Article 49, the emissions of the total process

# covered by the mass balance shall be the sum of the CO 2 quantities

# corresponding to all source streams covered by the mass balance. CO

# emitted to the atmosphere shall be calculated in the mass balance as

# emission of the molar equivalent amount of CO 2.

# Article 26

# Applicable tiers

# 1. When defining the relevant tiers for major and minor source

# streams in accordance with Article 21(1), to determine the activity

# data and each calculation factor, each operator shall apply the following:

# (a) at least the tiers listed in Annex V, in the case of a category A

# installation, or where a calculation factor is required for a source

# stream that is a commercial standard fuel;

# (b) in other cases than those referred to in point (a), the highest tier as

# defined in Annex II.

# However, for major source streams the operator may apply a tier one

# level lower than required in accordance with the first subparagraph for

# category C installations and up to two levels lower for category A and

# B installations, with a minimum of tier 1, where it shows to the satis­

# faction of the competent authority that the tier required in accordance

# with the first subparagraph is technically not feasible or incurs unreas­

# onable costs.

# The competent authority may, for a transitional period agreed with the

# operator, allow an operator to apply tiers for major source streams that

# are lower than those referred to in the second subparagraph, with a

# minimum of tier 1, provided that:

# (a) the operator shows to the satisfaction of the competent authority that

# the tier required pursuant to the second subparagraph is technically

# not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs; and

# (b) the operator provides an improvement plan indicating how and by

# when at least the tier required pursuant to the second subparagraph

# will be reached.

# ▼B


# 2. For minor source streams, the operator may apply a lower tier than

# required in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, with

# a minimum of tier 1, where it shows to the satisfaction of the competent

# authority that the tier required in accordance with the first subparagraph

# of paragraph 1 is technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.

# 3. For de minimis source streams, the operator may determine

# activity data and each calculation factor by using conservative

# estimates instead of using tiers, unless a defined tier is achievable

# without additional effort.

# 4. For the oxidation factor and conversion factor, the operator shall,

# as a minimum, apply the lowest tiers listed in Annex II.

# 5. Where the competent authority has allowed the use of emission

# factors expressed as t CO 2 /t or t CO 2 /Nm 3 for fuels, and for fuels used

# as process input or in mass balances in accordance with Article 25, the

# net calorific value may be monitored using a conservative estimate

# instead of using tiers, unless a defined tier is achievable without ad­

# ditional effort.

# S u b s e c t i o n 2

# A c t i v i t y d a t a

# Article 27

# Determination of activity data

# 1. The operator shall determine the activity data of a source stream in

# one of the following ways:

# (a) on the basis of continual metering at the process which causes the

# emissions;

# (b) on the basis of aggregation of metering of quantities delivered

# separately, taking into account relevant stock changes.

# 2. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, the quantity of fuel

# or material processed during the reporting period shall be calculated as

# the quantity of fuel or material received during the reporting period,

# minus the quantity of fuel or material moved out of the installation, plus

# the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the beginning of the reporting

# period, minus the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the end of the

# reporting period.

# Where it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to

# determine quantities in stock by direct measurement, the operator may

# estimate those quantities on the basis of one of the following:

# (a) data from previous years correlated with output for the reporting

# period;

# ▼B


# (b) documented procedures and respective data in audited financial

# statements for the reporting period.

# Where it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to

# determine activity data for the entire calendar year, the operator may

# choose the next most appropriate day to separate one reporting year

# from the subsequent year, and reconcile accordingly to the calendar

# year required. The deviations involved for one or more source

# streams shall be clearly recorded, form the basis of a value representa­

# tive for the calendar year, and be considered consistently in relation to

# the next year.

# Article 28

# Measurement systems under the operator's control

# 1. To determine activity data in accordance with Article 27, the

# operator shall use metering results based on measurement systems

# under its own control at the installation, provided that all of the

# following conditions are complied with:

# (a) the operator must carry out an uncertainty assessment and ensures

# that the uncertainty threshold of the relevant tier level is met;

# (b) the operator must ensure at least once a year and after each cali­

# bration of a measuring instrument that the calibration results

# multiplied by a conservative adjustment factor are compared with

# the relevant uncertainty thresholds. The conservative adjustment

# factor shall be based on an appropriate time series of previous

# calibrations of that or similar measuring instruments for taking

# into account the effect of uncertainty in service.

# Where tier thresholds approved in accordance with Article 12 are

# exceeded or equipment found not to conform with other requirements,

# the operator shall take corrective action without undue delay and notify

# the competent authority thereof.

# 2. When notifying a new monitoring plan or when it is relevant for a

# change to the approved monitoring plan, the operator shall provide the

# competent authority with the uncertainty assessment referred to in point

# (a) of paragraph 1.

# The assessment shall cover the specified uncertainty of the applied

# measuring instruments, uncertainty associated with the calibration, and

# any additional uncertainty connected to how the measuring instruments

# are used in practice. The uncertainty assessment shall cover uncertainty

# related to stock changes where the storage facilities are capable of

# containing at least 5 % of the annual used quantity of the fuel or

# material considered. When carrying out the assessment, the operator

# shall take into account the fact that the stated values used to define

# tier uncertainty thresholds in Annex II refer to the uncertainty over the

# full reporting period.

# ▼B


# The operator may simplify the uncertainty assessment by assuming that

# the maximum permissible errors specified for the measuring instrument

# in service or, where lower, the uncertainty obtained by calibration,

# multiplied by a conservative adjustment factor for taking into account

# the effect of uncertainty in service, are to be regarded as the uncertainty

# over the whole reporting period as required by the tier definitions in

# Annex II, provided that measuring instruments are installed in an envi­

# ronment appropriate for their use specifications.

# 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the competent authority may allow

# the operator to use metering results based on measurement systems

# under its own control at the installation, where the operator provides

# evidence that the measuring instruments applied are subject to relevant

# national legal metrological control.

# For that purpose, the maximum permissible error in service allowed by

# the relevant national legislation on legal metrological control for the

# relevant measuring task may be used as the uncertainty value without

# providing further evidence.

# Article 29

# Measurement systems outside the operator's own control

# 1. Where, based on a simplified uncertainty assessment, the use of

# measurement systems outside the operator's own control, as compared

# with the use of those within the operator's own control pursuant to

# Article 28, allows the operator to comply with at least as high a tier,

# gives more reliable results and is less prone to control risks, the operator

# shall determine the activity data from measurement systems outside its

# own control.

# To that end, the operator may revert to one of the following data

# sources:

# (a) amounts from invoices issued by a trade partner, provided that a

# commercial transaction between two independent trade partners

# takes place;

# (b) direct readings from the measurement systems.

# 2. The operator shall ensure compliance with the applicable tier

# pursuant to Article 26.

# To that end, the maximum permissible error in service allowed by

# relevant legislation for national legal metrological control for the

# relevant commercial transaction may be used as uncertainty without

# providing further evidence.

# Where the applicable requirements under national legal metrological

# control are less stringent than the applicable tier pursuant to Article 26,

# the operator shall obtain evidence on the applicable uncertainty from the

# trade partner responsible for the measurement system.

# Article 30

# Determination of calculation factors

# 1. The operator shall determine calculation factors either as default

# values or values based on analysis, depending on the applicable tier.

# 2. The operator shall determine and report calculation factors

# consistently with the state used for related activity data, referring to

# the fuel's or material's state in which the fuel or material is purchased

# or used in the emission-causing process, before it is dried or otherwise

# treated for laboratory analysis.

# Where such an approach incurs unreasonable costs or where higher

# accuracy can be achieved, the operator may consistently report

# activity data and calculation factors referring to the state in which

# laboratory analyses are carried out.

# The operator shall be required to determine the biomass fraction only

# for mixed fuels or materials. For other fuels or materials the default

# value of 0 % for the biomass fraction of fossil fuels or materials shall be

# used, and a default value of 100 % biomass fraction for biomass fuels

# or materials consisting exclusively of biomass.

# Article 31

# Default values for calculation factors

# 1. Where the operator determines calculation factors as default

# values, it shall use one of the following values, in accordance with

# the requirement of the applicable tier as set out in Annexes II and VI:

# (a) standard factors and stoichiometric factors listed in Annex VI;

# (b) standard factors used by the Member State for its national inventory

# submission to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework

# Convention on Climate Change;

# (c) literature values agreed with the competent authority, including

# standard factors published by the competent authority, which are

# compatible with factors referred to in point (b), but representative

# of more disaggregated sources of fuel streams;

# (d) values specified and guaranteed by the supplier of a fuel or material

# where the operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the

# competent authority that the carbon content exhibits a 95 %

# confidence interval of not more than 1 %;

# ▼B


# (e) values based on analyses carried out in the past, where the operator

# can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that

# those values are representative for future batches of the same fuel or

# material.

# 2. The operator shall specify all default values used in the monitoring

# plan.

# Where the default values change on an annual basis, the operator shall

# specify the authoritative applicable source of that value in the moni­

# toring plan.

# 3. The competent authority may approve a change of default values

# for a calculation factor in the monitoring plan pursuant to Article 15(2)

# only where the operator provides evidence that the new default value

# leads to a more accurate determination of emissions.

# 4. Upon application by the operator, the competent authority may

# allow that the net calorific value and emission factors of fuels are

# determined using the same tiers as required for commercial standard

# fuels provided that the operator submits, at least every three years,

# evidence that the 1 % interval for the specified calorific value has

# been met during the last three years.

# 5. Upon application by the operator, the competent authority may

# accept that the stoichiometric carbon content of a pure chemical

# substance be considered as meeting a tier that would otherwise

# require analyses carried out in accordance with Articles 32 to 35, if

# the operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent

# authority that using analyses would lead to unreasonable costs and

# that using the stoichiometric value will not lead to under-estimation

# of the emissions.

# Article 32

# Calculation factors based on analyses

# 1. The operator shall ensure that any analyses, sampling, calibrations

# and validations for the determination of calculation factors are carried

# out by applying methods based on corresponding EN standards.

# Where such standards are not available, the methods shall be based on

# suitable ISO standards or national standards. Where no applicable

# published standards exist, suitable draft standards, industry best-

# practice guidelines or other scientifically proven methodologies shall

# be used, limiting sampling and measurement bias.

# 2. Where online gas chromatographs or extractive or non-extractive

# gas analysers are used to determine emissions, the operator shall obtain

# the competent authority's approval for the use of such equipment. The

# equipment shall be used only with regard to composition data of

# gaseous fuels and materials. As minimum quality assurance measures,

# the operator shall ensure that an initial validation and annually repeated

# validations of the instrument are performed.

# ▼B


# 3. The result of any analysis shall be used only for the delivery

# period or batch of fuel or material for which the samples have been

# taken, and for which the samples were intended to be representative.

# When determining a specific parameter, the operator shall use the results

# of all analyses made with regard to that parameter.

# Article 33

# Sampling plan

# 1. Where calculation factors are determined by analyses, the operator

# shall submit to the competent authority for approval, for each fuel or

# material a sampling plan in the form of a written procedure, which

# contains information on methodologies for the preparation of samples,

# including information on responsibilities, locations, frequencies and

# quantities, and methodologies for the storage and transport of samples.

# The operator shall ensure that the derived samples are representative for

# the relevant batch or delivery period and free of bias. Relevant elements

# of the sampling plan shall be agreed with the laboratory carrying out the

# analysis for the respective fuel or material, and evidence of that

# agreement shall be included in the plan. The operator shall make the

# plan available for the purposes of verification pursuant to Implementing

# Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.

# 2. The operator shall, in agreement with the laboratory carrying out

# the analysis for the respective fuel or material and subject to the

# approval of the competent authority, adapt the elements of the

# sampling plan where analytical results indicate that the heterogeneity

# of the fuel or material significantly differs from the information on

# heterogeneity on which the original sampling plan for that specific

# fuel or material was based.

# Article 34

# Use of laboratories

# 1. The operator shall ensure that laboratories used to carry out

# analyses for the determination of calculation factors are accredited in

# accordance with EN ISO/IEC 17025, for the relevant analytical

# methods.

# 2. Laboratories not accredited in accordance with EN ISO/IEC 17025

# may be used for the determination of calculation factors only where the

# operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority

# that access to laboratories referred to in paragraph 1 is technically not

# feasible or would incur unreasonable costs, and that the non-accredited

# laboratory meets requirements equivalent to EN ISO/IEC 17025.

# ▼B


# 3. The competent authority shall deem a laboratory to meet

# requirements equivalent to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within the meaning of

# paragraph 2 where the operator provides, to the extent feasible, in the

# form and to a similar level of detail required for procedures pursuant to

# Article 12(2), evidence in accordance with the second and the third sub­

# paragraph of this paragraph.

# With respect to quality management, the operator shall produce an

# accredited certification of the laboratory in conformity with EN

# ISO/IEC 9001, or other certified quality management systems that

# cover the laboratory. In the absence of such certified quality

# management systems, the operator shall provide other appropriate

# evidence that the laboratory is capable of managing its personnel,

# procedures, documents and tasks in a reliable manner.

# With respect to technical competence, the operator shall provide

# evidence that the laboratory is competent and able to generate tech­

# nically valid results using the relevant analytical procedures. Such

# evidence shall cover at least the following elements:

# (a) management of the personnel's competence for the specific tasks

# assigned;

# (b) suitability of accommodation and environmental conditions;

# (c) selection of analytical methods and relevant standards;

# (d) where applicable, management of sampling and sample preparation,

# including control of sample integrity;

# (e) where applicable, development and validation of new analytical

# methods or application of methods not covered by international or

# national standards;

# (f) uncertainty estimation;

# (g) management of equipment, including procedures for calibration,

# adjustment, maintenance and repair of equipment, and record

# keeping thereof;

# (h) management and control of data, documents and software;

# (i) management of calibration items and reference materials;

# (j) quality assurance for calibration and test results, including regular

# participation in proficiency testing schemes, applying analytical

# methods to certified reference materials, or inter-comparison with

# an accredited laboratory;

# ▼B


# (k) management of outsourced processes;

# (l) management of assignments, customer complaints, and ensuring

# timely corrective action.

# Article 35

# Frequencies for analyses

# 1. The operator shall apply the minimum frequencies for analyses for

# relevant fuels and materials listed in Annex VII.

# 2. The competent authority may allow the operator to use a

# frequency that differs from those referred to in paragraph 1, where

# minimum frequencies are not available or where the operator demon­

# strates one of the following:

# (a) based on historical data, including analytical values for the

# respective fuels or materials in the reporting period immediately

# preceding the current reporting period, any variation in the

# analytical values for the respective fuel or material does not

# exceed 1/3 of the uncertainty value to which the operator has to

# adhere with regard to the activity data determination of the relevant

# fuel or material;

# (b) using the required frequency would incur unreasonable costs.

# Where an installation operates for part of the year only, or where fuels

# or materials are delivered in batches that are consumed over more than

# one calendar year, the competent authority may agree with the operator

# a more appropriate schedule for analyses, provided that it results in a

# comparable uncertainty as under point (a) of the first subparagraph.

**Emission factors for CO** (^2)

# 1. The operator shall determine activity-specific emission factors for

# CO 2 emissions.

# 2. Emission factors of fuels, including those used as process input,

# shall be expressed as t CO 2 /TJ.

# The competent authority may allow the operator to use an emission factor

# for a fuel expressed as t CO 2 /t or t CO 2 /Nm 3 for combustion emissions,

# ▼B


# where the use of an emission factor expressed as t CO 2 /TJ incurs unreas­

# onable costs or where at least equivalent accuracy of the calculated

# emissions can be achieved by using such an emission factor.

# 3. For the conversion of the carbon content into the respective value

# of a CO 2 related emission factor or vice versa , the operator shall use the

# factor 3,664 t CO 2 /t C.

# Article 37

# Oxidation and conversion factors

# 1. The operator shall use tier 1 as a minimum to determine oxidation

# or conversion factors. The operator shall use a value of 1 for oxidation

# or for a conversion factor where the emission factor includes the effect

# of incomplete oxidation or conversion.

# However, the competent authority may require operators to always use

# tier 1.

# 2. Where several fuels are used within an installation and tier 3 is to

# be used for the specific oxidation factor, the operator may ask for the

# approval of the competent authority for one or both of the following:

# (a) the determination of one aggregate oxidation factor for the whole

# combustion process and to apply it to all fuels;

# (b) the attribution of the incomplete oxidation to one major source

# stream and use of a value of 1 for the oxidation factor of the

# other source streams.

# Where biomass or mixed fuels are used, the operator shall provide

# evidence that application of points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph

# does not lead to an under-estimation of emissions.

# S u b s e c t i o n 5

# T r e a t m e n t o f b i o m a s s

# Article 38

# Biomass source streams

# 1. The operator may determine the activity data of a biomass source

# stream without using tiers and providing analytical evidence regarding

# the biomass content, where that source stream consists exclusively of

# biomass and the operator can ensure that it is not contaminated with

# other materials or fuels.^

# 2. The emission factor of biomass shall be zero.

# ▼B


# The emission factor of each fuel or material shall be calculated and

# reported as the preliminary emission factor, determined in accordance

# with Article 30, multiplied by the fossil fraction of the fuel or material.

# 3. Peat, xylite and fossil fractions of mixed fuels or materials shall

# not be considered biomass.

# 4. Where the biomass fraction of mixed fuels or materials is equal or

# higher than 97 %, or where, due to the amount of the emissions asso­

# ciated with the fossil fraction of the fuel or material, it qualifies as a de

# minimis source stream, the competent authority may allow the operator

# to apply no-tier methodologies, including the energy balance method,

# for determining activity data and relevant calculation factors.

# Article 39

# Determination of biomass and fossil fraction

# 1. For mixed fuels or materials, the operator may either assume the

# absence of biomass and apply a default fossil fraction of 100 %, or

# determine a biomass fraction in accordance with paragraph 2, applying

# tiers as defined in section 2.4 of Annex II.

# 2. Where, subject to the tier level required, the operator has to carry

# out analyses to determine the biomass fraction, it shall do so on the

# basis of a relevant standard and the analytical methods therein, provided

# that the use of that standard and analytical method are approved by the

# competent authority.

# Where, subject to the tier level required, the operator has to carry out

# analyses to determine the biomass fraction, but the application of the

# first subparagraph is technically not feasible or would incur unreas­

# onable costs, the operator shall submit an alternative estimation

# method to determine the biomass fraction to the competent authority

# for approval. For fuels or materials originating from a production

# process with defined and traceable input streams, the operator may

# base the estimation on a mass balance of fossil and biomass carbon

# entering and leaving the process.

# The Commission may provide guidelines on further applicable esti­

# mation methods.

# 3. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2 and Article 30,

# where the guarantee of origin has been established in accordance with

# Articles 2(j) and 15 of Directive 2009/28/EC for biogas injected into

# and subsequently removed from a gas network, the operator shall not

# use analyses to determine the biomass fraction.

# SECTION 3

# Measurement-based methodology

# Article 40

# Use of the measurement-based monitoring methodology

# The operator shall use measurement-based methodologies for all

# emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) as laid down in Annex IV, and to

# quantify CO 2 transferred pursuant to Article 49.

# In addition, the operator may use measurement-based methodologies for

# CO 2 emission sources where it can provide evidence that for each

# emission source the tiers required in accordance with Article 41 are

# complied with.

# Article 41

# Tier requirements

# 1. For each major emission source, the operator shall apply the

# following:

# (a) in the case of a category A installation, at least the tiers listed in

# section 2 of Annex VIII;

# (b) in other cases, the highest tier listed in section 1 of Annex VIII.

# However, the operator may apply a tier one level lower than required in

# accordance with the first subparagraph for category C installations and

# up to two levels lower for category A and B installations, with a

# minimum of tier 1, where it shows to the satisfaction of the

# competent authority that the tier required in accordance with the first

# subparagraph is technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.

# 2. For emissions from minor emission sources, the operator may

# apply a lower tier than required in accordance with the first subpara­

# graph of paragraph 1, with a minimum of tier 1, where it shows to the

# satisfaction of the competent authority that the tier required in

# accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 is technically

# not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.

# Article 42

# Measurement standards and laboratories

# 1. All measurements shall be carried out applying methods based on:

# (a) EN 14181 (Stationary source emissions — Quality assurance of

# automated measuring systems);

# (b) EN 15259 (Air quality — Measurement of stationary source

# emissions — Requirements for measurement sections and sites

# and for the measurement objective, plan and report);

# ▼B


# (c) other relevant EN standards, in particular EN ISO 16911-2

# (Stationary source emissions — Manual and automatic deter­

# mination of velocity and volume flow rate in ducts).

# Where such standards are not available, the methods shall be based on

# suitable ISO standards, standards published by the Commission or

# national standards. Where no applicable published standards exist,

# suitable draft standards, industry best practice guidelines or other scien­

# tifically proven methodologies shall be used, limiting sampling and

# measurement bias.

# The operator shall consider all relevant aspects of the continuous

# measurement system, including the location of the equipment, cali­

# bration, measurement, quality assurance and quality control.

# 2. The operator shall ensure that laboratories carrying out measure­

# ments, calibrations and relevant equipment assessments for CEMS are

# accredited in accordance with EN ISO/IEC 17025 for the relevant

# analytical methods or calibration activities.

# Where the laboratory does not have such accreditation, the operator

# shall ensure that equivalent requirements of Article 34(2) and (3) are

# met.

# Article 43

# Determination of emissions

# 1. The operator shall determine the annual emissions from an

# emission source over the reporting period by summing up over the

# reporting period all hourly values of the measured greenhouse gas

# concentration multiplied by the hourly values of the flue gas flow,

# where the hourly values shall be averages over all individual

# measurement results of the respective operating hour.

# In the case of CO 2 emissions, the operator shall determine annual

# emissions on the basis of equation 1 in Annex VIII. CO emitted to

# the atmosphere shall be treated as the molar equivalent amount of CO 2.

# In the case of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), the operator shall determine annual

# emissions on the basis of the equation in subsection B.1 of section 16 of

# Annex IV.

# 2. Where several emission sources exist in one installation and

# cannot be measured as one emission source, the operator shall

# measure emissions from those sources separately and add the results

# to obtain the total emissions of the gas in question over the reporting

# period.

# 3. The operator shall determine the greenhouse gas concentration in

# the flue gas by continuous measurement at a representative point

# through one of the following:

# ▼B


# (a) direct measurement;

# (b) in the case of high concentration in the flue gas, calculation of the

# concentration using an indirect concentration measurement applying

# equation 3 in Annex VIII and taking into account the measured

# concentration values of all other components of the gas stream as

# laid down in the operator's monitoring plan.

4. Where relevant, the operator shall determine separately any CO (^2)

# amount stemming from biomass and subtract it from the total measured

# CO 2 emissions. For this purpose the operator may use:

# (a) a calculation based approach, including approaches using analyses

# and sampling based on EN ISO 13833 (Stationary source emissions

# — Determination of the ratio of biomass (biogenic) and fossil-

# derived carbon dioxide — Radiocarbon sampling and deter­

# mination);

# (b) another method based on a relevant standard, including ISO 18466

# (Stationary source emissions — Determination of the biogenic

# fraction in CO 2 in stack gas using the balance method);

# (c) an estimation method published by the Commission.

# Where the method proposed by the operator involves continuous

# sampling from the flue gas stream, EN 15259 (Air quality —

# Measurement of stationary source emissions — Requirements for

# measurement sections and sites and for the measurement objective,

# plan and report) shall be applied.

# 5. The operator shall determine the flue gas flow for the calculation

# in accordance with paragraph 1 by one of the following methods:

# (a) calculation by means of a suitable mass balance, taking into account

all significant parameters on the input side, including for CO (^2)

# emissions at least input material loads, input airflow and process

# efficiency, and on the output side, including at least the product

# output and the concentration of oxygen (O 2 ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 )

and nitrogen oxides (NO (^) x );

# (b) determination by continuous flow measurement at a representative

# point.

# Article 44

# Data aggregation

# 1. The operator shall calculate hourly averages for each parameter,

# including concentrations and flue gas flow, relevant for determining

# emissions using a measurement-based methodology by using all data

# points available for that specific hour.

# ▼B


# Where an operator can generate data for shorter reference periods

# without additional cost, the operator shall use those periods for the

# determination of the annual emissions in accordance with Article 43(1).

# 2. Where the continuous measurement equipment for a parameter is

# out of control, out of range or out of operation for part of the hour or

# reference period referred to in paragraph 1, the operator shall calculate

# the related hourly average pro rata to the remaining data points for that

# specific hour or shorter reference period, provided that at least 80 % of

# the maximum number of data points for a parameter are available.

# Article 45(2) to (4) shall apply where fewer than 80 % of the maximum

# number of data points for a parameter are available.

# Article 45

# Missing data

# 1. Where a piece of measurement equipment within a CEMS is out

# of operation for more than five consecutive days in any calendar year,

# the operator shall inform the competent authority without undue delay

# and propose adequate measures to improve the quality of the CEMS in

# question.

# 2. Where a valid hour or shorter reference period in accordance with

# Article 44(1) of data cannot be provided for one or more parameters of

# the measurement-based methodology due to the equipment being out of

# control, out of range or out of operation, the operator shall determine

# values for substituting each missing hour of data.

# 3. Where a valid hour or shorter reference period of data cannot be

# provided for a parameter directly measured as concentration, the

# operator shall calculate a substitution value as the sum of an average

# concentration and twice the standard deviation associated with that

# average, using equation 4 in Annex VIII.

# Where the reporting period is not applicable for determining such

# substitution values due to significant technical changes at the instal­

# lation, the operator shall agree with the competent authority a represen­

# tative timeframe for determining the average and standard deviation,

# where possible with a duration of one year.

# 4. Where a valid hour of data cannot be provided for a parameter

# other than concentration, the operator shall obtain substitute values of

# that parameter through a suitable mass balance model or an energy

# balance of the process. The operator shall validate the results by

# using the remaining measured parameters of the measurement-based

# methodology and data at regular working conditions, considering a

# time period of the same duration as the data gap.

# ▼B


# Article 46

# Corroborating with calculation of emissions

# The operator shall corroborate emissions determined by a measurement-

# based methodology, with the exception of N 2 O emissions from nitric

# acid production and greenhouse gases transferred to a transport network

# or a storage site, by calculating the annual emissions of each greenhouse

# gas in question for the same emission sources and source streams.

# The use of tier methodologies shall not be required.

# SECTION 4

# Special provisions

# Article 47

# Installations with low emissions

# 1. The competent authority may allow the operator to submit a

# simplified monitoring plan in accordance with Article 13, provided

# that it operates an installation with low emissions.

# The first subparagraph shall not apply to installations carrying out

# activities for which N 2 O is included pursuant to Annex I to Directive

# 2003/87/EC.

# 2. For the purposes of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, an

# installation shall be considered an installation with low emissions

# where at least one of the following conditions is met:

# (a) the average annual emissions of that installation reported in the

# verified emissions reports during the trading period immediately

preceding the current trading period, with the exclusion of CO (^2)

# stemming from biomass and before subtraction of transferred

CO 2 , were less than 25 000 tonnes of CO (^) 2(e) per year;

# (b) the average annual emissions referred to in point (a) are not

# available or are no longer applicable because of changes to the

# installation's boundaries or changes to the operating conditions of

# the installation, but the annual emissions of that installation for the

# next five years, with the exclusion of CO 2 stemming from biomass

# and before subtraction of transferred CO 2 , will be, based on a

conservative estimation method, less than 25 000 tonnes of CO (^) 2(e)

# per year.

# 3. The operator of an installation with low emissions shall not be

# required to submit the supporting documents referred to in the third

# subparagraph of Article 12(1), and shall be exempt from the

# requirement of submitting an improvement report as referred to in

# Article 69(4) in response to recommendations for improvement

# reported by the verifier in the verification report.

# ▼B


# 4. By way of derogation from Article 27, the operator of an instal­

# lation with low emissions may determine the amount of fuel or material

# by using available and documented purchasing records and estimated

# stock changes. The operator shall also be exempt from the requirement

# to provide the uncertainty assessment referred to in Article 28(2) to the

# competent authority.

# 5. The operator of an installation with low emissions shall be exempt

# from the requirement in Article 28(2) to include uncertainty related to

# stock changes in an uncertainty assessment.

# 6. By way of derogation from Articles 26(1) and 41(1), the operator

# of an installation with low emissions may apply as a minimum tier 1 for

# the purposes of determining activity data and calculation factors for all

# source streams and for determining emissions by measurement-based

# methodologies, unless higher accuracy is achievable without additional

# effort for the operator, without providing evidence that applying higher

# tiers is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs.

# 7. For the purpose of determining calculation factors on the basis of

# analyses in accordance with Article 32, the operator of an installation

# with low emissions may use any laboratory that is technically competent

# and able to generate technically valid results using the relevant

# Article 48

**Inherent CO** (^2)

# 1. Inherent CO 2 that is transferred into an installation, including that

# contained in natural gas, a waste gas (including blast furnace or coke

# oven gas) or in process inputs (including synthesis gas), shall be

# included in the emission factor for that source stream.

# ▼B


# 2. Where inherent CO 2 originates from activities covered by Annex I

# to Directive 2003/87/EC or included pursuant to Article 24 of that

# Directive and is subsequently transferred out of the installation as part

# of a source stream to another installation and activity covered by that

# Directive, it shall not be counted as emissions of the installation where

# it originates.

# However, where inherent CO 2 is emitted, or transferred out of the

# installation to entities not covered by that Directive, it shall be

# counted as emissions of the installation where it originates.

# 3. The operators may determine quantities of inherent CO 2 trans­

# ferred out of the installation both at the transferring and at the

# receiving installation. In that case, the quantities of respectively trans­

# ferred and received inherent CO 2 shall be identical.

# Where the quantities of transferred and received inherent CO 2 are not

# identical, the arithmetical average of both determined values shall be

# used in both the transferring and receiving installations' emissions

# reports, where the deviation between the values can be explained by

# the uncertainty of the measurement systems or the determination

# method. In such cases, the emissions report shall refer to the

# alignment of that value.

# Where the deviation between the values cannot be explained by the

# approved uncertainty range of the measurement systems or the deter­

# mination method, the operators of the transferring and receiving instal­

# lations shall align the values by applying conservative adjustments

# approved by the competent authority.

# Article 49

**Transferred CO** (^2)

# 1. The operator shall subtract from the emissions of the installation

# any amount of CO 2 originating from fossil carbon in activities covered

# by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC that is not emitted from the instal­

# lation, but:

# (a) transferred out of the installation to any of the following:

# (i) a capture installation for the purpose of transport and long-term

# geological storage in a storage site permitted under

# Directive 2009/31/EC;

# (ii) a transport network with the purpose of long-term geological

# storage in a storage site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC;

# (iii) a storage site permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC for the

# (b) transferred out of the installation and used to produce precipitated

# calcium carbonate, in which the used CO 2 is chemically bound.

# ▼B


# 2. In its annual emissions report, the operator of the transferring

# installation shall provide the receiving installation's installation identifi­

# cation code recognised in accordance with the acts adopted pursuant to

# Article 19(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC, if the receiving installation is

# covered by that Directive. In all other cases, the operator of the trans­

# ferring installation shall provide the name, address and contact

# information of a contact person for the receiving installation.

# The first subparagraph shall also apply to the receiving installation with

# respect to the transferring installation's installation identification code.

# 3. For the determination of the quantity of CO 2 transferred from one

# installation to another, the operator shall apply a measurement-based

# methodology, including in accordance with Articles 43, 44 and 45.

# The emission source shall correspond to the measurement point and

# the emissions shall be expressed as the quantity of CO 2 transferred.

# For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 1, the operator shall apply a

# calculation-based methodology.

# 4. For determining the quantity of CO 2 transferred from one instal­

# lation to another, the operator shall apply the highest tier as defined in

# section 1 of Annex VIII.

# However, the operator may apply the next lower tier provided that it

# establishes that applying the highest tier as defined in section 1 of

# Annex VIII is technically not feasible or incurs unreasonable costs.

# For determining the quantity of CO 2 chemically bound in precipitated

# calcium carbonate, the operator shall use data sources representing

# highest achievable accuracy.

# 5. The operators may determine quantities of CO 2 transferred out of

# the installation both at the transferring and at the receiving installation.

# In such cases, Article 48(3) shall apply.

# Article 50

# Use or transfer of N 2 O

# 1. Where N 2 O originates from activities covered by Annex I to

# Directive 2003/87/EC for which that Annex specifies N 2 O as relevant

# and an installation does not emit the N 2 O but transfers it to another

# installation that monitors and reports emissions in accordance with this

# Regulation, it shall not be counted as emissions of the installation where

# it originates.

# An installation that receives N 2 O from an installation and activity in

# accordance with the first subparagraph shall monitor the relevant gas

# streams using the same methodologies, as required by this Regulation,

# as if the N 2 O were generated within the receiving installation itself.

# ▼B


# However, where N 2 O is bottled or used as a gas in products so that it is

# emitted outside the installation, or where it is transferred out of the

# installation to entities not covered by Directive 2003/87/EC, it shall

# be counted as emissions of the installation where it originates, except

# for quantities of N 2 O in respect of which the operator of the installation

# where the N 2 O originates can demonstrate to the competent authority

# that the N 2 O is destroyed using suitable emissions abatement

# equipment.

# 2. In its annual emissions report, the operator of the transferring

# installation shall provide the receiving installation's installation identifi­

# cation code recognised in accordance with the acts adopted pursuant to

# Article 19(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC, if relevant.

# The first subparagraph shall also apply to the receiving installation with

# respect to the transferring installation's installation identification code.

# 3. To determine the quantity of N 2 O transferred from one installation

## CHAPTER IV

## MONITORING OF EMISSIONS AND TONNE-KILOMETRE DATA

# FROM AVIATION

# Article 51

# General provisions

# 1. Each aircraft operator shall monitor and report emissions from

# aviation activities for all flights included in Annex I to Directive

# 2003/87/EC that are performed by that aircraft operator during the

# reporting period and for which the aircraft operator is responsible.

# To that end, the aircraft operator shall attribute all flights to the calendar

# year according to the time of departure measured in Coordinated

# Universal Time.

# ▼B


# 2. The aircraft operator intending to apply for an allocation of

# allowances free of charge pursuant to Articles 3e or 3f of Directive

# 2003/87/EC shall also monitor tonne-kilometre data for the same

# flights during the respective monitoring years.

# 3. For the purpose of identifying the unique aircraft operator referred

# to in point (o) of Article 3 of Directive 2003/87/EC that is responsible

# for a flight, the call sign used for air traffic control purposes, shall be

# used. The call sign shall be one of the following:

# (a) the ICAO designator laid down in box 7 of the flight plan;

# (b) where the ICAO designator of the aircraft operator is not available,

# the registration markings of the aircraft.

# 4. Where the identity of the aircraft operator is not known, the

# competent authority shall consider the owner of the aircraft as aircraft

# operator unless it proves the identity the aircraft operator responsible.

# Article 52

# Submission of monitoring plans

# 1. At the latest four months before an aircraft operator commences

# aviation activities covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, it shall

# submit to the competent authority a monitoring plan for the monitoring

# and reporting of emissions in accordance with Article 12.

# By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an aircraft operator

# that performs an aviation activity covered by Annex I to Directive

# 2003/87/EC for the first time that could not be foreseen four months

# in advance of the activity shall submit a monitoring plan to the

# competent authority without undue delay, but no later than six weeks

# after performance of that activity. The aircraft operator shall provide

# adequate justification to the competent authority why a monitoring plan

# could not be submitted four months in advance of the activity.

# Where the administering Member State referred to in Article 18a of

# Directive 2003/87/EC is not known in advance, the aircraft operator

# shall without undue delay submit the monitoring plan when information

# on the competent authority of the administering Member State becomes

# available.

# 2. Where the aircraft operator is intending to apply for an allocation

# of allowances free of charge pursuant to Article 3e or 3f of Directive

# 2003/87/EC, it shall also submit a monitoring plan for the monitoring

# and reporting of tonne-kilometre data. That monitoring plan shall be

# submitted at the latest four months prior to the start of one of the

# following:

# (a) the monitoring year mentioned in Article 3e(1) of Directive

# 2003/87/EC for applications pursuant to that Article;

# ▼B


# (b) the second calendar year of the period referred to in Article 3c(2) of

# Directive 2003/87/EC for applications pursuant to Article 3f of that

# Directive.

# Article 53

# Monitoring methodology for emissions from aviation activities

# 1. Each aircraft operator shall determine the annual CO 2 emissions

# from aviation activities by multiplying the annual consumption of each

# fuel (expressed in tonnes) by the respective emission factor.

# 2. Each aircraft operator shall determine the fuel consumption for

# each flight and for each fuel, including fuel consumed by the

# auxiliary power unit. For that purpose, the aircraft operator shall use

# one of the methods laid down in section 1 of Annex III. The aircraft

# operator shall choose the method that provides for the most complete

# and timely data combined with the lowest uncertainty without incurring

# unreasonable costs.

# 3. Each aircraft operator shall determine the fuel uplift referred to in

# section 1 of Annex III based on one of the following:

# (a) the measurement by the fuel supplier, as documented in the fuel

# delivery notes or invoices for each flight;

# (b) data from aircraft onboard measurement systems recorded in the

# mass and balance documentation, in the aircraft technical log or

# transmitted electronically from the aircraft to the aircraft operator.

# 4. The aircraft operator shall determine fuel contained in the tank

# using data from aircraft onboard measurement systems and recorded

# in the mass and balance documentation, in the aircraft technical log

# or transmitted electronically from the aircraft to the aircraft operator.

# 5. Where the amount of fuel uplift or the amount of fuel remaining in

# the tanks is determined in units of volume, expressed in litres, the

# aircraft operator shall convert that amount from volume to mass by

# using density values. The aircraft operator shall use the fuel density

# (which may be an actual or a standard value of 0,8 kg per litre) that

# is used for operational and safety reasons.

# The procedure for informing the use of actual or standard density shall

# be described in the monitoring plan along with a reference to the

# relevant aircraft operator documentation.

# 6. For the purposes of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1, the

# aircraft operator shall use the default emission factors set out in table 1

# in Annex III.

# ▼B


# For fuels not listed in that table, the aircraft operator shall determine the

# emission factor in accordance with Article 32. For such fuels, the net

# calorific value shall be determined and reported as a memo-item.

# 7. By way of derogation from paragraph 6, the aircraft operator may,

# upon approval by the competent authority, derive the emission factor or

# the carbon content, on which it is based, or the net calorific value for

# commercially traded fuels from the purchasing records for the fuel in

# question, as provided by the fuel supplier, provided that those have been

# derived on the basis of internationally accepted standards and the

# emission factors listed in table 1 of Annex III cannot be applied.

# Article 54

# Specific provisions for biomass

# Article 39 shall apply accordingly to the determination of the biomass

# fraction of a mixed fuel.

# Notwithstanding Article 39(2), the competent authority shall allow the

# use of a methodology uniformly applicable in all Member States for the

# determination of the biomass fraction, as appropriate.

# Under that methodology, the biomass fraction, net calorific value and

# emission factor or carbon content of the fuel used in an EU ETS

# aviation activity listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC shall be

# determined using fuel purchase records.

# The methodology shall be based on the guidelines provided by the

# Commission to facilitate its consistent application in all Member States.

# The use of biofuels for aviation shall be assessed in accordance with

# Article 18 of Directive 2009/28/EC.

# Article 55

# Small emitters

# 1. Aircraft operators operating fewer than 243 flights per period for

# three consecutive four-month periods and aircraft operators operating

# flights with total annual emissions lower than 25 000 tonnes CO 2 per

# year shall be considered small emitters.

# 2. By way of derogation from Article 53, small emitters may

# estimate the fuel consumption using tools implemented by Eurocontrol

# or another relevant organisation, which can process all relevant air

# traffic information and avoid any underestimations of emissions.

# ▼B


# The applicable tools may only be used if they are approved by the

# Commission including the application of correction factors to

# compensate for any inaccuracies in the modelling methods.

# 3. By way of derogation from Article 12, a small emitter that intends

# to make use of any of the tools referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article

# may submit only the following information in the monitoring plan for

# emissions:

# (a) information required pursuant to point 1 of section 2 of Annex I;

# (b) evidence that the thresholds for small emitters set out in paragraph 1

# of this Article are met;

# (c) the name of or reference to the tool as referred to in paragraph 2 of

# this Article that will be used for estimating the fuel consumption.

# A small emitter shall be exempted from the requirement to submit the

# supporting documents referred to in the third subparagraph of

# Article 12(1).

# 4. Where an aircraft operator uses any of the tools referred to in

# paragraph 2 and exceeds the thresholds referred to in paragraph 1

# during a reporting year, the aircraft operator shall notify the

# competent authority thereof without undue delay.

# The aircraft operator shall, without undue delay, submit a significant

# modification of the monitoring plan within the meaning of point (iv) of

# Article 15(4)(a) to the competent authority for approval.

# However, the competent authority shall allow that the aircraft operator

# continues to use a tool referred to in paragraph 2 provided that that

# aircraft operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent

# authority that the thresholds referred to in paragraph 1 have not

# already been exceeded within the past five reporting periods and will

# not be exceeded again from the following reporting period onwards.

# Article 56

# Sources of uncertainty

# 1. The aircraft operator shall consider sources of uncertainty and their

# associated levels of uncertainty when selecting the monitoring

# methodology pursuant to Article 53(2).

# 2. The aircraft operator shall regularly perform suitable control activ­

# ities, including cross-checks between the fuel uplift quantity as provided

# by invoices and the fuel uplift quantity indicated by on-board

# measurement, and take corrective action if notable deviations are

# observed.

# ▼B


# Article 57

# Determination of tonne-kilometre data

# 1. Aircraft operators intending to apply for an allocation of

# allowances free of charge pursuant to Article 3e or 3f of Directive

# 2003/87/EC shall monitor tonne-kilometre data for all flights covered

# by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC in the monitoring years relevant for

# such applications.

# 2. The aircraft operator shall calculate tonne-kilometre data by multi­

# plying the distance, calculated in accordance with section 3 of Annex III

# and expressed in kilometres (km), by the payload, calculated as the sum

# of the mass of freight, mail, passengers and checked baggage expressed

# in tonnes (t).

# 3. The aircraft operator shall determine the mass of freight and mail

# on the basis of the actual or standard mass contained in the mass and

# balance documentation for the relevant flights.

# Aircraft operators not required to have a mass and balance documen­

# tation shall propose in the monitoring plan a suitable methodology for

# determining the mass of freight and mail, while excluding the tare

# weight of all pallets and containers that are not payload and the

# service weight.

# 4. The aircraft operator shall determine the mass of passengers using

# one of the following tiers:

# (a) tier 1: consisting in a default value of 100 kg for each passenger

# including their checked baggage;

# (b) tier 2: consisting in the mass for passengers and checked baggage

# contained in the mass and balance documentation for each flight.

# However, the tier selected shall apply to all flights in the monitoring

# years relevant for applications pursuant to Article 3e or 3f of Directive

# 2003/87/EC.

# not contain misstatements and is in conformance with the monitoring

# plan, those written procedures and this Regulation.

# ▼B


# Where the aircraft operator intends to apply for an allocation of

# allowances free of charge pursuant to Article 3e or 3f of Directive

# 2003/87/EC, the first subparagraph shall also apply to the monitoring

# and reporting of tonne-kilometre data.

# 2. Descriptions of written procedures for data flow activities in the

# monitoring plan shall at least cover the following elements:

# (e) relevant electronic data processing and storage systems used and the

# interaction between such systems and other inputs, including

# manual input;

# (f) the way outputs of data flow activities are recorded.

# Article 59

# Control system

# 1. The operator or aircraft operator shall establish, document,

# implement and maintain an effective control system to ensure that the

# annual emissions report and, where applicable, the tonne-kilometre

# report resulting from data flow activities does not contain misstatements

# and is in conformity with the monitoring plan and this Regulation.

# 2. The control system referred to in paragraph 1 shall consist of the

# following:

# (a) an operator's or aircraft operator's assessment of inherent risks and

# control risks based on a written procedure for carrying out the

# assessment;

# (b) written procedures related to control activities that are to mitigate

# out pursuant to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.

# Whenever the control system is found to be ineffective or not commen­

# surate with the risks identified, the operator or aircraft operator shall

# seek to improve the control system and update the monitoring plan or

# the underlying written procedures for data flow activities, risk

# assessments and control activities as appropriate.

# Article 60

# Quality assurance

# 1. For the purposes of point (a) of Article 59(3), the operator shall

# ensure that all relevant measuring equipment is calibrated, adjusted and

# checked at regular intervals, including prior to use, and checked against

# measurement standards traceable to international measurement stan­

# dards, where available, in accordance with the requirements of this

# Regulation and proportionate to the risks identified.

# Where components of the measuring systems cannot be calibrated, the

# by analysis, calculated or obtained from the supplier of the fuel

# or material, with national or international reference factors of

# comparable fuels or materials;

# (iii) a comparison of emissions obtained from measurement-based

# methodologies and the results of the corroborating calculation

# pursuant to Article 46;

# (iv) a comparison of aggregated data and raw data.

# 2. The operator or aircraft operator shall, to the extent possible,

# ensure the criteria for rejecting data as part of the review and validation

# are known in advance. For that purpose the criteria for rejecting data

# shall be laid down in the documentation of the relevant written

# procedures.

# Article 64

# Corrections and corrective action

# 1. Where any part of the data flow activities referred to in Article 58

# or control activities referred to in Article 59 is found not to function

# effectively, or to function outside boundaries that are set in documen­

# tation of procedures for those data flow activities and control activities,

# the operator or aircraft operator shall make appropriate corrections and

# correct rejected data while avoiding underestimation of emissions.

# 2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the operator or aircraft operator

# shall at least proceed to all of the following:

# (a) assessment of the validity of the outputs of the applicable steps in

# Article 66

# Treatment of data gaps

# 1. Where data relevant for the determination of the emissions of an

# installation are missing, the operator shall use an appropriate estimation

# method to determine conservative surrogate data for the respective time

# period and missing parameter.

# Where the operator has not laid down the estimation method in a

# written procedure, it shall establish such a written procedure and

# submit to the competent authority for approval an appropriate modifi­

# cation of the monitoring plan in accordance with Article 15.

# 2. Where data relevant for the determination of an aircraft operator's

# emissions for one or more flights are missing, the aircraft operator shall

# use surrogate data for the respective time period calculated in

# accordance with the alternative method defined in the monitoring plan.

# Where surrogate data cannot be determined in accordance with the first

# subparagraph of this paragraph, the emissions for that flight or those

# flights may be estimated by the aircraft operator from the fuel

# consumption determined by using a tool referred to in Article 55(2).

# ▼B


# Where the number of flights with data gaps referred to in the first two

# sub-paragraphs exceed 5 % of the annual flights that are reported, the

# operator shall inform the competent authority thereof without undue

# delay and shall take remedial action for improving the monitoring

# methodology.

# Article 67

# Records and documentation

# 1. The operator or aircraft operator shall keep records of all relevant

# data and information, including information as listed in Annex IX, for at

# authority may be considered to be retained by the operator or aircraft

# operator, if they can access those data.

# 2. The operator or aircraft operator shall ensure that relevant

# documents are available when and where they are needed to perform

# the data flow activities and control activities.

# The operator or aircraft operator shall, upon request, make those

# documents available to the competent authority and to the verifier

# verifying the emissions report or tonne-kilometre report in accordance

# with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.

## CHAPTER VI

# REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

# Article 68

# Timing and obligations for reporting

# 1. The operator or aircraft operator shall submit to the competent

# authority by 31 March of each year an emissions report that covers

# the annual emissions in the reporting period and that is verified in

# accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.

# However, competent authorities may require operators or aircraft

# operators to submit the verified annual emission report earlier than by

# 31 March, but by 28 February at the earliest.

# 2. Where the aircraft operator chooses to apply for the allocation of

# emission allowances free of charge pursuant to Article 3e or 3f of

# Directive 2003/87/EC, the aircraft operator shall submit to the

# competent authority by 31 March of the year following the monitoring

# year referred to in Article 3e or 3f of that Directive a tonne-kilometre

# report that covers the tonne-kilometre data of the monitoring year and

# that is verified in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU)

# 2018/2067.

# ▼B


# 3. The annual emissions reports and tonne-kilometre reports shall

# contain at least the information listed in Annex X.

# Article 69

# Reporting on improvements to the monitoring methodology

# 1. Each operator or aircraft operator shall regularly check whether the

# monitoring methodology applied can be improved.

# An operator of an installation shall submit to the competent authority

# for approval a report containing the information referred to in paragraph

# 2 or 3, where appropriate, by the following deadlines:

# (a) for a category A installation, by 30 June every four years;

# (b) for a category B installation, by 30 June every two years;

# (c) for a category C installation, by 30 June every year.

# However, the competent authority may set an alternative date for

# submission of the report, but no later date than 30 September of the

# same year.

# By way of derogation from the second and third subparagraphs, and

# without prejudice to the first subparagraph, the competent authority may

# approve, together with the monitoring plan or the improvement report,

# an extension of the deadline applicable pursuant to the second subpara­

# graph, if the operator provides evidence to the satisfaction of the

# competent authority upon submission of a monitoring plan in

# accordance with Article 12 or upon notification of updates in

# accordance with Article 15, or upon submission of an improvement

# report in accordance with this Article, that the reasons for unreasonable

# costs or for improvement measures being technically not feasible will

# remain valid for a longer period of time. That extension shall take into

# account the number of years for which the operator provides evidence.

# The total time period between improvement reports shall not exceed

# three years for a category C installation, four years for a category B

# installation or five years for a category A installation.

# 2. Where the operator does not apply at least the tiers required

# pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 26(1) to major source

# streams and minor source streams and pursuant to Article 41 to

# emission sources, the operator shall provide a justification as to why

# it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to apply

# the required tiers.

# However, where evidence is found that measures needed for reaching

# those tiers have become technically feasible and do not any more incur

# unreasonable costs, the operator shall notify the competent authority of

# appropriate modifications of the monitoring plan in accordance with

# Article 15, and submit proposals for implementing the related

# measures and its timing.

# ▼B


# 3. Where the operator applies a fall-back monitoring methodology

# referred to in Article 22, the operator shall provide: a justification as

# to why it is technically not feasible or would incur unreasonable costs to

# apply at least tier 1 for one or more major or minor source streams.

# However, where evidence is found that measures needed for reaching at

# least tier 1 for those source streams have become technically feasible

# and do not any more incur unreasonable costs, the operator shall notify

# the competent authority of appropriate modifications of the monitoring

# plan in accordance with Article 15 and submit proposals for implemen­

# ting the related measures and its timing.

# 4. Where the verification report established in accordance with Im­

# plementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 states outstanding non-

# conformities or recommendations for improvements, in accordance

# with Articles 27, 29 and 30 of that Implementing Regulation, the

# operator or aircraft operator shall submit to the competent authority

# for approval a report by 30 June of the year in which that verification

# report is issued by the verifier. That report shall describe how and when

# the operator or aircraft operator has rectified or plans to rectify the non-

# conformities identified by the verifier and to implement recommended

# improvements.

# The competent authority may set an alternative date for submission of

# the report as referred to in this paragraph, but no later date than 30

# September of the same year. Where applicable, such report may be

# combined with the report referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.

# Where recommended improvements would not lead to an improvement

# of the monitoring methodology, the operator or aircraft operator shall

# provide a justification of why that is the case. Where the recommended

# improvements would incur unreasonable costs, the operator or aircraft

# operator shall provide evidence of the unreasonable nature of the costs.

# 5. Paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply where the operator or

# aircraft operator has already resolved all non-conformities and recom­

# mendations for improvement and has submitted related modifications of

# the monitoring plan to the competent authority for approval in

# accordance with Article 15 of this Regulation before the date set

# pursuant to paragraph 4.

# Article 70

# Determination of emissions by the competent authority

# not been verified in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU)

# 2018/2067.

# ▼B


# 2. Where a verifier has stated, in the verification report pursuant to

# Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067, the existence of non-material

# misstatements which have not been corrected by the operator or aircraft

# operator before issuing the verification report, the competent authority

# shall assess those misstatements, and make a conservative estimate of

# the emissions of the installation or aircraft operator where appropriate.

# The competent authority shall inform the operator or aircraft operator

# whether and which corrections are required to the annual emissions

# report. The operator or aircraft operator shall make that information

# available to the verifier.

## 4. DEFINITION OF TIERS FOR THE CALCULATION FACTORS FOR

## CO 2 PROCESS EMISSIONS

```
For all CO 2 process emissions, in particular for emissions from the decom­
position of carbonates and from process materials containing carbon other
than in form of carbonates, including urea, coke and graphite, where they
are monitored using the standard methodology in accordance with
Article 24(2), the tiers defined in this section for the applicable calculation
factors shall be applied.
```
```
In case of mixed materials which contain inorganic as well as organic forms
of carbon, the operator may choose:
```
```
— to determine a total preliminary emission factor for the mixed material
by analysing the total carbon content, and using a conversion factor and
```
- if applicable – biomass fraction and net calorific value related to that
total carbon content; or

```
— to determine the organic and inorganic contents separately and treat
them as two separate source streams.
```
```
For emissions from the decomposition of carbonates, the operator may
choose for each source stream one of the following methods:
```
```
(a) Method A (Input based): The emission factor, conversion factor and
activity data are related to the amount of material input into the process.
```
```
(b) Method B (Output based): The emission factor, conversion factor and
activity data are related to the amount of output from the process.
```
```
For other CO 2 process emissions, the operator shall apply only method A.
```
```

accordance with point (b) or (c) of Article 31(1), or values in accordance
with point (d) of Article 31(1).
```
```
Tier 3: The operator shall determine the emission factor in accordance with
Articles 32 to 35. Stoichiometric ratios as listed in section 2 of Annex VI
shall be used to convert composition data into emission factors, where
relevant.
```
```
4.2. Tiers for the conversion factor using Method A
```
```
Tier 1: A conversion factor of 1 shall be used.
```
```
Tier 2: Carbonates and other carbon leaving the process shall be considered
by means of a conversion factor with a value between 0 and 1. The operator
may assume complete conversion for one or several inputs and attribute
unconverted materials or other carbon to the remaining inputs. The ad­
ditional determination of relevant chemical parameters of the products
shall be carried out in accordance with Articles 32 to 35.
```
```
4.3. Tiers for the emission factor using Method B
```
```
Tier 1: The operator shall apply one of the following:
```
```
(a) the standard factors listed in Annex VI section 2 Table 3.
```
```
(b) other constant values in accordance with point (e) of Article 31(1),
where no applicable value is contained in Annex VI.
```
```
Tier 2: The operator shall apply a country specific emission factor in
accordance with point (b) or (c) of Article 31(1), or values in accordance
with point (d) of Article 31(1).
```
```
Tier 3: The operator shall determine the emission factor in accordance with
Articles 32 to 35. Stoichiometric ratios referred to in Annex VI section 2
Table 3 shall be used to convert composition data into emission factors
assuming that all of the relevant metal oxides have been derived from
respective carbonates. For this purpose the operator shall take into
account at least CaO and MgO, and shall provide evidence to the
competent authority as to which further metal oxides relate to carbonates
in the raw materials.
```
```
4.4. Tiers for the conversion factor using Method B
```
```
Tier 1: A conversion factor of 1 shall be used.
```
```
Tier 2: The amount of non-carbonate compounds of the relevant metals in
the raw materials, including return dust or fly ash or other already calcined
materials, shall be reflected by means of conversion factors with a value
between 0 and 1 with a value of 1 corresponding to a full conversion of raw
material carbonates into oxides. The additional determination of relevant
chemical parameters of the process inputs shall be carried out in accordance
with Articles 32 to 35.
```
```
4.5. Tiers for the net calorific value (NCV)
```
```
If relevant, the operator shall determine the net calorific value of the process
material using the tiers defined in section 2.2 of this Annex. NCV is
considered not relevant for de minimis source streams or where the
material is not itself combustible without other fuels being added. If in
doubt, the operator shall seek confirmation by the competent authority on
```
# whether NCV has to be monitored and reported.

# ▼M1


```
4.6. Tiers for the biomass fraction
```
```
If relevant, the operator shall determine the biomass fraction of the carbon
contained in the process material, using the tiers defined in section 2.4 of

## ANNEX III

```
Monitoring methodologies for aviation (Article 53 and Article 57)
```
## 1. CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF

## GHGS IN THE AVIATION SECTOR

```
Method A:
```
```
The operator shall use the following formula:
```
```
Actual fuel consumption for each flight [t] = Amount of fuel contained in
aircraft tanks once fuel uplift for the flight is complete [t] – Amount of fuel
contained in aircraft tanks once fuel uplift for subsequent flight is complete [t]
+ Fuel uplift for that subsequent flight [t]
```
```
Where there is no fuel uplift for the flight or subsequent flight, the amount of
fuel contained in aircraft tanks shall be determined at block-off for the flight
or subsequent flight. In the exceptional case that an aircraft performs activities
other than a flight, including undergoing major maintenance involving the
emptying of the tanks, after the flight for which fuel consumption is being
monitored, the aircraft operator may substitute the quantity ‘Amount of fuel
contained in aircraft tanks once fuel uplift for subsequent flight is complete +
Fuel uplift for that subsequent flight’ with the ‘Amount of fuel remaining in
tanks at the start of the subsequent activity of the aircraft’, as recorded by
technical logs.
```
```
Method B:
```
```
The operator shall use the following formula:
```
```
Actual fuel consumption for each flight [t] = Amount of fuel remaining in
aircraft tanks at block-on at the end of the previous flight [t] + Fuel uplift for
the flight [t] - Amount of fuel contained in tanks at block-on at the end of the
flight [t]
```
```
The moment of block-on may be considered equivalent to the moment of
engine shut down. Where an aircraft does not perform a flight previous to the
flight for which fuel consumption is being monitored, the aircraft operator
may substitute the quantity ‘Amount of fuel remaining in aircraft tanks at
block-on at the end of the previous flight’ with the ‘Amount of fuel remaining
in aircraft tanks at the end of the previous activity of the aircraft’, as recorded
by technical logs.

## 8. PFC EMISSIONS FROM PRODUCTION OR PROCESSING OF

## PRIMARY ALUMINIUM AS LISTED IN ANNEX I TO DIRECTIVE

## 2003/87/EC

```
A. Scope
```
```
The operator shall apply the following for emissions of perfluorocarbons
(PFCs) resulting from anode effects including fugitive emissions of
PFCs. For associated CO 2 emissions, including emissions from electrode
production, the operator shall apply section 7 of this Annex. The operator
shall furthermore calculate PFC emissions not related to anode effects based
on estimation methods in accordance with industry best practice, and any
guidelines published by the Commission for this purpose.
```
```
B. Determination of PFC emissions
```
```
PFC emissions shall be calculated from the emissions measurable in a duct
or stack (‘point source emissions’) as well as fugitive emissions using the
collection efficiency of the duct:
```
```
PFC emissions (total) = PFC emissions (duct) / collection efficiency
```
```
The collection efficiency shall be measured when the installation-specific
emission factors are determined. For its determination the most recent
version of the guidance mentioned under Tier 3 of section 4.4.2.4 of the
```
# 2006 IPCC Guidelines shall be used.

# ▼B


```
The operator shall calculate emissions of CF 4 and C 2 F 6 emitted through a
duct or stack using one of the following methods:
```
```
(a) Method A where the anode effect minutes per cell-day are recorded;
```
```
(b) Method B where the anode effect overvoltage is recorded.
```
```
Calculation Method A – Slope Method:
```
```
The operator shall use the following equations for determining PFC
emissions:
```
CF 4 emissions [t] = AEM × (SEF (^) CF4 /1 000) × Pr (^) Al
C 2 F 6 emissions [t] = CF 4 emissions × F (^) C2F6
Where:
AEM = Anode effect minutes / cell-day;
SEF (^) CF4 = Slope emission factor [(kg CF 4 / t Al produced) / (anode effect
minutes / cell-day)]. Where different cell-types are used, different SEF may
be applied as appropriate;
Pr (^) Al = Annual production of primary Aluminium [t];
F (^) C2F6 = Weight fraction of C 2 F 6 (t C 2 F 6 / t CF 4 ).
The anode effect minutes per cell-day shall express the frequency of anode
effects (number anode effects / cell-day) multiplied by the average duration
of anode effects (anode effect minutes / occurrence):
AEM = frequency × average duration
**Emission factor:** The emission factor for CF 4 (slope emission factor,
SEF (^) CF4 ) expresses the amount [kg] of CF 4 emitted per tonne of
aluminium produced per anode effect minute / cell-day. The emission
factor (weight fraction F (^) C2F6 ) of C 2 F 6 expresses the amount [t] of C 2 F (^6)
emitted proportionate to the amount [t] of CF 4 emitted.
**Tier 1:** The operator shall use technology-specific emission factors from
Table 1 of this section of Annex IV.
**Tier 2:** The operator shall use installation-specific emission factors for CF (^4)
and C 2 F 6 established through continuous or intermittent field measure­
ments. For the determination of those emission factors the operator shall
use the most recent version of the guidance mentioned under Tier 3 of
section 4.4.2.4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines ( 1 ). The emission factor shall
also take into account emissions related to non-anode effects. The operator
shall determine each emission factor with a maximum uncertainty of ± 15 %.
The operator shall determine the emission factors at least every three years or
earlier where necessary due to relevant changes at the installation. Relevant
changes shall include a change in the distribution of anode effect duration, or
a change in the control algorithm affecting the mix of the types of anode

# effects or the nature of the anode effect termination routine.

CF 4 emissions [t] = OVC × (AEO/CE) × Pr (^) Al × 0,001

# ▼M1

C 2 F 6 emissions [t] = CF 4 emissions × F (^) C2F6

```
Where:
```
```
OVC = Overvoltage coefficient (‘emission factor’) expressed as kg CF 4 per
tonne of aluminium produced per mV overvoltage;
```
```
AEO = Anode effect overvoltage per cell [mV] determined as the integral of
(time × voltage above the target voltage) divided by the time (duration) of
data collection;

```
The term AEO/CE (Anode effect overvoltage / current efficiency) expresses
the time-integrated average anode effect overvoltage [mV overvoltage] per
average current efficiency [%].
```
```
Emission factor: The emission factor for CF 4 (‘overvoltage coefficient’
OVC) shall express the amount [kg] of CF 4 emitted per tonne of
aluminium produced per millivolt overvoltage [mV]. The emission factor
```
of C 2 F 6 (weight fraction F (^) C2F6 ) shall express the amount [t] of C 2 F (^6)
emitted proportionate to the amount [t] of CF 4 emitted.
**Tier 1:** : The operator shall apply technology-specific emission factors from
Table 2 of this section of Annex IV.
**Tier 2:** The operator shall use installation-specific emission factors for CF (^4)
[(kg CF 4 / t Al ) / (mV)] and C 2 F 6 [t C 2 F 6 / t CF 4 ] established through
continuous or intermittent field measurements. For the determination of those
emission factors, the operator shall use the most recent version of the
guidance mentioned under Tier 3 of section 4.4.2.4 of the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines. The operator shall determine the emission factors with a

# maximum uncertainty of ± 15 % each.

# limestone and shales and raw materials used for waste gas scrubbing.

# ▼B

```
B. Specific monitoring rules
```
```
Emissions from combustion shall be monitored in accordance with section 1
of this Annex. Process emissions from raw meal components shall be
monitored in accordance with section 4 of Annex II based on the
carbonate content of the process input (calculation Method A) or on the
amount of clinker produced (calculation Method B). In case of Method A,
carbonates to be taken into account shall at least include CaCO 3 , MgCO 3 and
FeCO 3. In case of Method B, the operator shall take into account at least
CaO and MgO, and shall provide evidence to the competent authority as to
```
# which extent further carbon sources have to be taken into account.

# ▼M1

```
CO 2 emissions related to dust removed from the process and non-carbonate
carbon in the raw materials shall be added in accordance with subsections C
```
# and D of this section.

# ▼B

```
Calculation Method A: Kiln Input Based
```
```
Where cement kiln dust (CKD) and bypass dust leave the kiln system the
operator shall not consider the related raw material as process input, but
```
# calculate emissions from CKD in accordance with subsection C.

# ▼B


```
Unless the raw meal is characterised, the operator shall apply the uncertainty
requirements for activity data separately to each of the relevant carbon-
bearing kiln inputs, avoiding double counting or omissions from returned
or by-passed materials. Where activity data is determined based on the
clinker produced, the net amount of raw meal may be determined by
means of a site-specific empirical raw meal/clinker ratio. That ratio shall
be updated at least once per year applying industry best practice guidelines.
```

```
```
The operator shall determine activity data as the clinker production [t] over
the reporting period in one of the following ways:
```
```
(a) by direct weighing of clinker;
```
```
(b) based on cement deliveries, by material balance taking into account
dispatch of clinker, clinker supplies as well as clinker stock variation,
using the following formula:
```
```
clinker produced [t] = ((cement deliveries [t] – cement stock variation [t]) × clinker /
cement ratio [t clinker / t cement]) – (clinker supplied [t]) +
(clinker dispatched [t]) – (clinker stock variation [t]).
```
```
The operator shall either derive the clinker / cement ratio for each of the
different cement products based on the provisions of Articles 32 to 35 or
calculate the ratio from the difference of cement deliveries and stock changes
and all materials used as additives to the cement including by-pass dust and
cement kiln dust.

(CKD) leaving the kiln system, corrected for a partial calcination ratio of
CKD calculated as process emissions in accordance with Article 24(2). By
way of derogation from section 4 of Annex II, tiers 1 and 2 for the emission
factor shall be defined as follows:
```
```
Tier 1: The operator shall apply an emission factor of 0,525 t CO 2 /t dust.
```
```
Tier 2: The operator shall determine the emission factor (EF) at least once
annually following Articles 32 to 35 and using the following formula:

CKD];
_EF_ (^) _Cli_ = Installation-specific emission factor of clinker [t CO 2 /t clinker];
_d_ = Degree of CKD calcination (released CO 2 as % of total carbonate
CO 2 in the raw mix).

# Tier 3 for the emission factor is not applicable.

## GLYOXYLIC ACID PRODUCTION AS LISTED IN ANNEX I TO

## DIRECTIVE 2003/87/EC

```
A. Scope
```
```
Each operator shall consider for each activity from which N 2 O emissions
result, all sources emitting N 2 O from production processes, including where
N 2 O emissions from production are channelled through any abatement
equipment. This includes any of the following:
```
```
(a) nitric acid production – N 2 O emissions from the catalytic oxidation of
```
ammonia and/or from the NO (^) x /N 2 O abatement units;
(b) adipic acid production – N 2 O emissions including from the oxidation
reaction, any direct process venting and/or any emissions control
equipment;
(c) glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production – N 2 O emissions including from
the process reactions, any direct process venting and/or any emissions
control equipment;
(d) caprolactam production – N 2 O emissions including from the process
reactions, any direct process venting and/or any emissions control
equipment.
These provisions shall not apply to any N 2 O emissions from the combustion
of fuels.
B. **Determination of N 2 O emissions**
B.1. _Annual N 2 O emissions_
The operator shall monitor emissions of N 2 O from nitric acid production
using continuous emissions measurement. The operator shall monitor
emissions of N 2 O from adipic acid, caprolactam, glyoxal and glyoxylic
acid production using a measurement-based methodology for abated
emissions and a calculation-based method (based on a mass balance method­
ology) for temporary occurrences of unabated emissions.
For each emission source where continuous emissions measurement is
applied, the operator shall consider the total annual emissions to be the
sum of all hourly emissions using equation 1 given in section 3 of Annex
VIII.
B.2. _Hourly N 2 O emissions_
The operator shall calculate annual average hourly N 2 O emissions for each
source where continuous emission measurement is applied using equation 2

# given in section 3 of Annex VIII.

# ▼B


```
The operator shall determine hourly N 2 O concentrations in the flue gas from
each emission source using a measurement-based methodology at a represen­
```
tative point, after the NO (^) x /N 2 O abatement equipment, where abatement is
used. The operator shall apply techniques capable of measuring N 2 O concen­
trations of all emission sources during both abated and unabated
conditions. Where uncertainties increase during such periods, the operator
shall take them into account in the uncertainty assessment.
The operator shall adjust all measurements to a dry gas basis where required
and report them consistently.
B.3. _Determination of flue gas flow_
The operator shall use the methods for monitoring flue gas flow set out in
Article 43(5) of this Regulation for measuring the flue gas flow for N 2 O
emissions monitoring. For nitric acid production, the operator shall apply the
method in accordance with point (a) of Article 43(5) unless it is technically
not feasible. In that case and upon approval by the competent authority, the
operator shall apply an alternative method, including by a mass balance
methodology based on significant parameters such as ammonia input load,
or determination of flow by continuous emissions flow measurement.
The flue gas flow shall be calculated in accordance with the following
formula:
V (^) flue gas flow [Nm 3 /h] = V (^) air * (1 – O (^) 2, air ) / (1 – O (^) 2, flue gas )
Where:
V (^) air = Total input air flow in Nm 3 /h at standard conditions;
O (^) 2, air = Volume fraction of O 2 in dry air [= 0,2095];
O (^) 2, flue gas = Volume fraction of O 2 in the flue gas.
The V (^) air shall be calculated as the sum of all air flows entering the nitric acid
production unit.
The operator shall apply the following formula, unless stated otherwise in its
monitoring plan:
V (^) air = V (^) prim + V (^) sec + V (^) seal
Where:
V (^) prim = Primary input air flow in Nm 3 /h at standard conditions;
V (^) sec = Secondary input air flow in Nm 3 /h at standard conditions;
V (^) seal = Seal input air flow in Nm 3 /h at standard conditions.
The operator shall determine V (^) prim by continuous flow measurement before
the mixing with ammonia takes place. The operator shall determine V (^) sec by
continuous flow measurement, including where the measurement is before
the heat recovery unit. For V (^) seal the operator shall consider the purged
airflow within the nitric acid production process.
For input air streams accounting for cumulatively less than 2,5 % of the total
air flow, the competent authority may accept estimation methods for the
determination of that air flow rate proposed by the operator based on

# industry best practices.

# ▼B


```
The operator shall provide evidence through measurements under normal
operating conditions that the flue gas flow measured is sufficiently homo­
geneous to allow for the proposed measurement method. Where non-homo­
geneous flow is confirmed through these measurements, the operator shall
take that into account when determining appropriate monitoring methods and
when calculating the uncertainty in the N 2 O emissions.
```
```
The operator shall adjust all measurements to a dry gas basis and report them
consistently.
```
```
B.4. Oxygen (O 2 ) concentrations
```
```
The operator shall measure the oxygen concentrations in the flue gas where
necessary for calculating the flue gas flow in accordance with subsection B.3
of this section of Annex IV. In doing so, the operator shall comply with the
requirements for concentration measurements within Article 41(1) and (2). In
determining the uncertainty of N 2 O emissions, the operator shall take the
uncertainty of O 2 concentration measurements into account.
```
```
The operator shall adjust all measurements to a dry gas basis where required
and report them consistently.
```
```
B.5. Calculation of N 2 O emissions
```
```
For specific periods of unabated emissions of N 2 O from adipic acid, capro­
lactam, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production, including unabated emissions
from venting for safety reasons and when abatement plant fails, and where
continuous emissions monitoring of N 2 O is technically not feasible, the
operator shall subject to the approval of the specific methodology by the
competent authority calculate N 2 O emissions using a mass balance method­
ology. For this purpose the overall uncertainty shall be similar to the result of
applying the tier requirements of Article 41(1) and (2). The operator shall
base the calculation method on the maximum potential emission rate of N 2 O
from the chemical reaction taking place at the time and the period of the
emission.
```
```
The operator shall take the uncertainty in any calculated emissions for a
specific emission source into account in determining the annual average
hourly uncertainty for the emission source.
```
```
B.6. Determination of activity production rates
```
```
Production rates shall be calculated using daily production reports and hours
of operation.
```
```
B.7. Sampling rates
```
```
Valid hourly averages or averages for shorter reference periods shall be
calculated in accordance with Article 44 for:
```
```
(a) concentration of N 2 O in the flue gas;
```
```
(b) total flue gas flow where this is measured directly and where required;
```
```
(c) all gas flows and oxygen concentrations necessary to determine the total
flue gas flow indirectly.
```
C. **Determination of annual CO 2 equivalent – CO** (^) **2(e)**
The operator shall convert the total annual N 2 O emissions from all emissions
sources, measured in tonnes to three decimal places, to annual CO (^) 2(e) in
rounded tonnes, using the following formula and the GWP values in
Annex VI section 3:
CO (^) 2(e) [t] = N 2 O (^) annual [t] × GWP (^) N2O

# Where:

# ▼B


N 2 O (^) annual = total annual N 2 O emissions, calculated according to equation 1
given in section 3 of Annex VIII.
The total annual CO (^) 2(e) generated by all emission sources and any direct CO (^2)
emissions from other emission sources included under the greenhouse gas
permit shall be added to the total annual CO 2 emissions generated by the
installation and shall be used for reporting and surrendering allowances.
Total annual emissions of N 2 O shall be reported in tonnes to three decimal
places and as CO (^) 2(e) in rounded tonnes.

21. DETERMINATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM CO (^2)
CAPTURE ACTIVITIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRANSPORT AND
GEOLOGICAL STORAGE IN A STORAGE SITE PERMITTED UNDER
DIRECTIVE 2009/31/EC
A. **Scope**
CO 2 capture shall be performed either by a dedicated installation receiving
CO 2 by transfer from one or more other installations, or by the same instal­
lation carrying out the activities producing the captured CO 2 under the same
greenhouse gas emissions permit. All parts of the installation related to CO (^2)
capture, intermediate storage, transfer to a CO 2 transport network or to a site
for geological storage of CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions shall be included in
the greenhouse gas emissions permit and accounted for in the associated
monitoring plan. In the case of the installation carrying out other activities
covered by Directive 2003/87/EC, the emissions of those activities shall be
monitored in accordance with the other relevant sections of this Annex.
The operator of a CO 2 capture activity shall at least include the following
potential sources of CO 2 emission:
(a) CO 2 transferred to the capture installation;
(b) combustion and other associated activities at the installation that are
related to the capture activity, including fuel and input material use.
B. **Quantification of transferred and emitted CO2 amounts**
B.1. _Installation level quantification_
Each operator shall calculate the emissions by taking into account the
potential CO 2 emissions from all emission relevant processes at the instal­
lation, as well as the amount of CO 2 captured and transferred to the transport
network, using the following formula:
E (^) capture installation = T (^) input + E (^) without capture – T (^) for storage
Where:
E (^) capture installation = Total greenhouse gas emissions of the capture installation;
T (^) input = Amount of CO 2 transferred to the capture installation, determined in
accordance with Article 40 to 46 and Article 49.
E (^) without capture = Emissions of the installation assuming the CO 2 were not
captured, meaning the sum of the emissions from all other activities at the
installation, monitored in accordance with relevant sections of Annex IV;
T (^) for storage = Amount of CO 2 transferred to a transport network or a storage
site, determined in accordance with Article 40 to 46 and Article 49.
In cases where CO 2 capture is carried out by the same installation as the one
from which the captured CO 2 originates, the operator shall use zero for
T (^) input.
In cases of stand-alone capture installations, the operator shall consider
E (^) without capture to represent the amount of emissions that occur from other
sources than the CO 2 transferred to the installation for capture. The operator

# shall determine those emissions in accordance with this Regulation.

# ▼B


```
In the case of stand-alone capture installations, the operator of the installation
```
transferring CO 2 to the capture installation shall deduct the amount T (^) input
from the emissions of its installation in accordance with Article 49.
B.2. _Determination of transferred CO_ (^2)
Each operator shall determine the amount of CO 2 transferred from and to the
capture installation in accordance with Article 49 by means of measurement
methodologies carried out in accordance with Articles 40 to 46.
Only where the operator of the installation transferring CO 2 to the capture
installation demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that
CO 2 transferred to the capture installation is transferred in total and to at least
equivalent accuracy, may the competent authority allow that operator to use a
calculation-based methodology in accordance with Article 24 or 25 to
determine the amount T (^) input instead of a measurement-based methodology
in accordance with Article 40 to 46 and Article 49.

## 22. DETERMINATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE

## TRANSPORT OF CO 2 BY PIPELINES FOR GEOLOGICAL STORAGE

## IN A STORAGE SITE PERMITTED UNDER DIRECTIVE 2009/31/EC

```

```
```
The boundaries for monitoring and reporting emissions from CO 2 transport
by pipeline shall be laid down in the transport network's greenhouse gas
emissions permit, including all ancillary plant functionally connected to the
transport network, including booster stations and heaters. Each transport
network shall have a minimum of one start point and one end point, each
connected to other installations carrying out one or more of the activities:
capture, transport or geological storage of CO 2. Start and end points may
include bifurcations of the transport network and cross national borders. Start
and end points as well as the installations they are connecting to, shall be
laid down in the greenhouse gas emissions permit.
```
```
Each operator shall consider at least the following potential emission sources
for CO 2 emissions: combustion and other processes at installations func­
tionally connected to the transport network including booster stations;
fugitive emissions from the transport network; vented emissions from the
transport network; and emissions from leakage incidents in the transport
network.
```
B. **Quantification Methodologies for CO** (^2)
The operator of transport networks shall determine emissions using one of
the following methods:
(a) Method A (overall mass balance of all input and output streams) set out
in subsection B.1;
(b) Method B (monitoring of emission sources individually) set out in
subsection B.2.
In choosing either Method A or Method B, each operator shall demonstrate
to the competent authority that the chosen methodology will lead to more
reliable results with lower uncertainty of the overall emissions, using best
available technology and knowledge at the time of the application for the
greenhouse gas emissions permit and approval of the monitoring plan,
without incurring unreasonable costs. Where Method B is chosen each
operator shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority
that the overall uncertainty for the annual level of greenhouse gas

# emissions for the operator's transport network does not exceed 7,5 %.^

# ▼B


The operator of a transport network using Method B shall not add CO (^2)
received from another installation permitted in accordance with Directive
2003/87/EC to its calculated level of emissions, and shall not subtract
from its calculated level of emissions any CO 2 transferred to another instal­
lation permitted in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC.
Each operator of a transport network shall use Method A for the validation
of the results of Method B at least once annually. For that validation, the
operator may use lower tiers for the application of Method A.
B.1. **Method A**
Each operator shall determine emissions in accordance with the following
formula:

```
i
```
_T_ (^) _IN;i_ Ä

## X

```
i
```
_T_ (^) _OUT;i_
Where:
Emissions = Total CO 2 emissions of the transport network [t CO 2 ];
E (^) own activity = Emissions from the transport network's own activity, meaning
not emissions stemming from the CO 2 transported, but including emissions
from fuel used in booster stations, monitored in accordance with the relevant
sections of Annex IV;
T (^) IN,i = Amount of CO 2 transferred to the transport network at entry point _i_ ,
determined in accordance with Articles 40 to 46 and Article 49.
T (^) OUT,i = Amount of CO 2 transferred out of the transport network at exit
point _i_ , determined in accordance with Articles 40 to 46 and Article 49.
B.2. **Method B**
Each operator shall determine emissions considering all processes relevant to
emissions at the installation as well as the amount of CO 2 captured and
transferred to the transport facility using the following formula:
Emissions [t CO 2 ] = CO (^) 2 fugitive + CO (^) 2 vented + CO (^) 2 leakage events + CO (^) 2 installations
Where:
Emissions = Total CO 2 emissions of the transport network [t CO 2 ];
CO (^) 2 fugitive = Amount of fugitive emissions [t CO 2 ] from CO 2 transported in
the transport network, including from seals, valves, intermediate compressor
stations and intermediate storage facilities;
CO (^) 2 vented = Amount of vented emissions [t CO 2 ] from CO 2 transported in
the transport network;
CO (^) 2 leakage events = Amount of CO 2 [t CO 2 ] transported in the transport
network, which is emitted as the result of the failure of one or more
components of the transport network;
CO (^) 2 installations = Amount of CO 2 [t CO 2 ] being emitted from combustion or
other processes functionally connected to the pipeline transport in the
transport network, monitored in accordance with the relevant sections of

# Annex IV.

# ▼B

```
```
(d) intermediate compressor stations;
```
```
(e) intermediate storage facilities.

The operator shall determine average emission factors EF (expressed in
g CO 2 /unit time) per piece of equipment per occurrence where fugitive
emissions can be anticipated at the beginning of operation, and by the end
of the first reporting year in which the transport network is in operation at
the latest. The operator shall review those factors at least every 5 years in the
light of the best available techniques and knowledge.
```
```
The operator shall calculate fugitive emissions by multiplying the number of
pieces of equipment in each category by the emission factor and adding up
the results for the single categories as shown in the following equation:
```
```
Fugitive Em ½ t CO 2 â ¼
```
## A

## X

```
Category
```
_EF_ ½ _g CO_ 2 _=occurr_ â · _N_ (^) _occurr_

## !

## = 10 6

The number of occurrences ( _N_ (^) _occurr_ ) shall be the number of pieces of the
given equipment per category, multiplied by the number of time units per
year.
B.2.2. _Emissions from leakage events_
The operator of a transport network shall provide evidence of the network
integrity by using representative (spatial and time-related) temperature and
pressure data. Where the data indicates that a leakage has occurred, the
operator shall calculate the amount of CO 2 leaked with a suitable
methodology documented in the monitoring plan, based on industry best
practice guidelines, including by use of the differences in temperature and
pressure data compared to integrity related average pressure and temperature
values.
B.2.3. _Vented emissions_
Each operator shall provide in the monitoring plan an analysis regarding
potential situations of venting emissions, including for maintenance or
emergency reasons, and provide a suitable documented methodology for
calculating the amount of CO 2 vented, based on industry best practice guide­
lines.

CO 2 emitted [t CO 2 ] = V CO 2 [t CO 2 ] + F CO 2 [t CO 2 ]
```
```
Where:
```
```
V CO 2 = amount of CO 2 vented;
```
```
F CO 2 = amount of CO 2 from fugitive emissions.
```
```
Each operator shall determine V CO 2 using measurement-based method­
ologies in accordance with Articles 41 to 46 of this Regulation. By way of
derogation from the first sentence and upon approval by the competent
authority, the operator may include in the monitoring plan an appropriate
methodology for determining V CO 2 based on industry best practice, where
the application of measurement-based methodologies would incur unreas­
onable costs.
```
```
The operator shall consider F CO 2 as one source, meaning that the uncer­
tainty requirements associated with the tiers in accordance with section 1 of
Annex VIII are applied to the total value instead of the individual emission
points. Each operator shall provide in the monitoring plan an analysis
regarding potential sources of fugitive emissions, and provide a suitable
documented methodology to calculate or measure the amount of F CO 2 ,
```
based on industry best practice guidelines. For the determination of F CO (^2)
the operator may use data collected in accordance with Article 32 to 35 and
Annex II(1.1)(e) to (h) of Directive 2009/31/EC for the injection facility,
where they comply with the requirements of this Regulation.
B.2. _Vented and fugitive emissions from enhanced hydrocarbon recovery
operations_
Each operator shall consider the following potential additional emission
sources from enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR):
(a) the oil-gas separation units and gas recycling plant, where fugitive
emissions of CO 2 could occur;
(b) the flare stack, where emissions might occur due to the application of
continuous positive purge systems and during depressurisation of the
hydrocarbon production installation;
(c) the CO 2 purge system, to avoid high concentrations of CO 2 extin­

# guishing the flare.

# ▼B


```
Each operator shall determine fugitive emissions or vented CO 2 in
accordance with subsection B.1 of this section of Annex IV.
```
```
Each operator shall determine emissions from the flare stack in accordance
with subsection D of section 1 of this Annex, taking into account potential
inherent CO 2 in the flare gas in accordance with Article 48.
```
```
B.3. Leakage from the storage complex
```
```
Emissions and release to the water column shall be quantified as follows:
```
_CO_ (^2) _emitted_ ½ _t CO_ 2 â ¼
X _T_^ _End_^
_T_ (^) _Start
L CO_ 2 ½ _t CO_ 2 _=d_ â
Where:
L CO 2 = the mass of CO 2 emitted or released per calendar day due to the
leakage in accordance with all of the following:
(a) for each calendar day for which leakage is monitored, each operator
shall calculate L CO 2 as the average of the mass leaked per hour [t
CO 2 /h] multiplied by 24;
(b) each operator shall determine the mass leaked per hour in accordance
with the provisions in the approved monitoring plan for the storage site
and the leakage;
(c) for each calendar day prior to commencement of monitoring, the
operator shall take the mass leaked per day to equal the mass leaked
per day for the first day of monitoring ensuring no under-estimation
occurs;
T (^) start = the latest of:
(a) the last date when no emissions or release of CO 2 into the water
column from the source under consideration were reported;
(b) the date the CO 2 injection started;
(c) another date such that there is evidence demonstrating to the satisfaction
of the competent authority that the emission or release into the water
column cannot have started before that date.
T (^) end = the date by which corrective measures in accordance with Article 16
of Directive 2009/31/EC have been taken and emissions or release of CO (^2)
into the water column can no longer be detected.
The competent authority shall approve and allow the use of other methods
for the quantification of emissions or release of CO 2 into the water column
from leakages where the operator can show to the satisfaction of the
competent authority that such methods lead to a higher accuracy than the
methodology set out in this subsection.
The operator shall quantify the amount of emissions leaked from the storage
complex for each of the leakage events with a maximum overall uncertainty
over the reporting period of 7,5 %. Where the overall uncertainty of the
applied quantification methodology exceeds 7,5 %, each operator shall
apply an adjustment, as follows:
CO (^) 2,Reported [t CO 2 ] = CO (^) 2,Quantified [t CO 2 ] × (1 + (Uncertainty (^) System [%]/100) – 0,075)
Where:
CO (^) 2,Reported = the amount of CO 2 to be included in the annual emission
report with regards to the leakage event in question;
CO (^) 2,Quantified = the amount of CO 2 determined through the used quantifi­
cation methodology for the leakage event in question;
UncertaintySystem = the level of uncertainty associated with the quantifi­

# cation methodology used for the leakage event in question.
