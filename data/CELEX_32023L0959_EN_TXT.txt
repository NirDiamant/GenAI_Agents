THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
```
```
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
```
```
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
```
```
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
```
```
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(^1 ),
```
```
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(^2 ),
```
```
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(^3 ),
```
```
Whereas:
```
```
(1) The Paris Agreement(^4 ), adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the ‘Paris Agreement’), entered into force on 4 November 2016. The Parties to the Paris
Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial
levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. That commitment
has been reinforced with the adoption under the UNFCCC of the Glasgow Climate Pact on 13 November 2021, in
which the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement,
recognises that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1,5 oC, compared
with 2 oC, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 oC.
```
```
(2) The urgency of the need to keep the Paris Agreement goal of 1,5 °C alive has become more significant following the
findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Sixth Assessment Report that global warming can
only be limited to 1,5 °C if strong and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions within this decade are
immediately undertaken.
```
```
(3) Tackling climate- and environmental-related challenges and reaching the objectives of the Paris Agreement are at the
core of the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European
Green Deal’).
```
```
(4) The European Green Deal combines a comprehensive set of mutually reinforcing measures and initiatives aimed at
achieving climate neutrality in the Union by 2050, and sets out a new growth strategy that aims to transform the
Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where
economic growth is decoupled from resource use. It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural
capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. This transition
affects workers from various sectors differently. At the same time, that transition has gender equality aspects as well
as a particular impact on some disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as older people, persons with disabilities,

persons with a minority racial or ethnic background and low and lower-middle income individuals and households.
It also imposes greater challenges on certain regions, in particular structurally disadvantaged and peripheral regions,
as well as on islands. It must therefore be ensured that the transition is just and inclusive, leaving no one behind.
```
```
(5) On 17 December 2020 , the Union submitted its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC,
following its approval by the Council. Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(^5 ), as
amended by, inter alia, Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^6 ), is one of the
instruments cited, subject to revision in light of the enhanced 2030 target, in the general description of the target in
the Annex to that submission. The Council stated in its conclusions of 24 October 2022 that it stands ready, as soon
as possible after the conclusions of the negotiations on the essential elements of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, to update, as
appropriate, the NDC of the Union and its Member States, in line with paragraph 29 of the Glasgow Climate Pact to
reflect how the final outcome of the essential elements of the ‘Fit for 55’ package implements the Union headline
target as agreed by the European Council in December 2020. As the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS),
established by Directive 2003/87/EC, is a cornerstone of the Union’s climate policy and constitutes its key tool for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way, the amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC, including
with regard to the scope thereof, adopted through this Directive are part of the essential elements of the ‘Fit for 55’
package.
```
```
(6) The necessity and the value of delivering on the European Green Deal have only grown in light of the very severe
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health, the living and working conditions and the well-being of the
Union’s citizens. Those effects have shown that our society and our economy need to improve their resilience in
relation to external shocks and act early to prevent or mitigate the effects of external shocks in a manner that is just
and results in no one being left behind, including those at risk of energy poverty. European citizens continue to
express strong views that this applies in particular to climate change.
```
```
(7) The Union committed to reducing the Union’s economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared
to 1990 levels by 2030 in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat on 17 December 2020.
```
```
(8) Through the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^7 ), the Union
has enshrined in legislation the objective of economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest and the aim of
achieving negative emissions thereafter. That Regulation also establishes a binding Union domestic reduction target
for net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels
by 2030, and provides that the Commission is to endeavour to align all future draft measures or legislative
proposals, including budgetary proposals, with the objectives of that Regulation and, in any case of non-alignment,
provide the reasons for such non-alignment as part of the impact assessment accompanying those proposals.
```
```
(9) All sectors of the economy need to contribute to achieving the emission reductions established by Regulation
(EU) 2021/1119. Therefore, the ambition of the EU ETS should be adjusted so as to be in line with the economy-
wide net greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030, the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050
at the latest and the aim of achieving negative emissions thereafter, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119.

(10) The EU ETS should incentivise production from installations that partly reduce or fully eliminate greenhouse gas
emissions. Therefore, the description of some categories of activities in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC should be
amended to ensure that installations performing an activity listed in that Annex and meeting the capacity threshold
related to the same activity, but not emitting any greenhouse gases, are included within the scope of the EU ETS,
and thereby ensure there is equal treatment of installations in the sectors concerned. In addition, free allocation for
the production of a product should take into account, as guiding principles, the circular use-potential of materials
and the fact that the benchmark should be independent of the feedstock or the type of production process, where
the production processes have the same purpose. It is therefore necessary to modify the definition of the products
and of the processes and emissions covered for some benchmarks, to ensure a level playing field for installations
using new technologies that partly reduce or fully eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and installations using
existing technologies. Notwithstanding those guiding principles, the revised benchmarks for 2026 to 2030 should
continue to distinguish between primary and secondary production of steel and aluminium. It is also necessary to
decouple the update of the benchmark values for refineries and for hydrogen to reflect the increasing importance of
production of hydrogen, including green hydrogen, outside the refineries sector.
```
```
(11) Following the modification of the definitions of the products and of the processes and emissions covered for some
benchmarks, it is necessary to ensure that producers do not receive double compensation for the same emissions
with both free allocation and indirect costs compensation, and thus to adjust accordingly the financial measures to
compensate indirect costs passed on in electricity prices.
```
```
(12) Council Directive 96/61/EC(^8 )was repealed by Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council(^9 ). The references to Directive 96/61/EC in Article 2 of Directive 2003/87/EC and in its Annex IV should
be updated accordingly. Given the need for urgent economy-wide emission reductions, Member States should be
able to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are within the scope of the EU ETS also through policies other
than emission limits adopted pursuant to Directive 2010/75/EU.
```
```
(13) In its communication of 12 May 2021entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All - EU Action Plan: Towards Zero
Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’, the Commission calls for the steering of the Union towards zero pollution by
2050, by reducing air, freshwater, sea and soil pollution to levels which are no longer expected to be harmful for
health and natural ecosystems. Measures under Directive 2010/75/EU, as the main instrument regulating air, water
and soil pollutant emissions, will often also enable greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced. In line with Article 8 of
Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States should ensure coordination between the permit requirements of
Directive 2003/87/EC and those of Directive 2010/75/EU.
```
```
(14) Recognising that new innovative technologies will often allow emissions of both greenhouse gases and pollutants to
be reduced, it is important to ensure synergies between measures delivering reductions of emissions of both
greenhouse gases and pollutants, in particular Directive 2010/75/EU, and review their effectiveness in this regard.
```
```
(15) The definition of electricity generators was used to determine the maximum amount of free allocation to industry in
the period from 2013 to 2020, but led to different treatment of cogeneration power plants compared to industrial
installations. In order to incentivise the use of high efficiency cogeneration and to level the playing field for all
installations receiving free allocation for heat production and district heating, all references to electricity generators
in Directive 2003/87/EC should be deleted. In addition, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331(^10 )
specifies the details relating to the eligibility of all industrial processes for free allocation. Therefore, the provisions
on carbon capture and storage in Article 10a(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC have become obsolete and should
be deleted.

(16) Greenhouse gases that are not directly released into the atmosphere should be considered emissions under the EU
ETS and allowances should be surrendered for those emissions unless they are stored in a storage site in accordance
with Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(^11 ), or they are permanently chemically
bound in a product so that they do not enter the atmosphere under normal use and do not enter the atmosphere
under any normal activity taking place after the end of the life of the product. The Commission should be
empowered to adopt delegated acts specifying the conditions according to which greenhouse gases are to be
considered as permanently chemically bound in a product so that they do not enter the atmosphere under normal
use and do not enter the atmosphere under any normal activity after the end of the life of the product, including
obtaining a carbon removal certificate, where appropriate, in view of regulatory developments with regard to the
certification of carbon removals. Normal activity after the end of the life of the product should be understood
broadly, covering all the activities taking place after the end of the life of the product, including reuse,
remanufacturing, recycling and disposal, such as incineration and landfill.
```
```
(17) International maritime transport activity, consisting of voyages between ports under the jurisdiction of two different
Member States or between a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State and a port outside the jurisdiction of any
Member State, has been the only means of transportation not included in the Union’s past commitments to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from fuel sold in the Union for voyages that depart in one Member State and
arrive in a different Member State or a third country have grown by around 36 % since 1990. Those emissions
represent close to 90 % of all Union navigation emissions, as emissions from fuel sold in the Union for voyages
departing from and arriving in the same Member State have been reduced by 26 % since 1990. In a business-as-
usual scenario, emissions from international maritime transport activities are projected to grow by around 14 %
between 2015 and 2030 and by 34 % between 2015 and 2050. If the climate change impact of maritime transport
activities grows as projected, it would significantly undermine reductions made by other sectors to combat climate
change and therefore to achieve the economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030, the
Union’s climate-neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest, and the aim of achieving negative emissions thereafter, as
laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
```
```
(18) In 2013, the Commission adopted a strategy for progressively integrating maritime transport emissions into the
Union’s policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As a first step in this approach, the Union established a
system to monitor, report and verify emissions from maritime transport in Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the
European Parliament and of the Council(^12 ), to be followed by the laying down of reduction targets for maritime
transport and the application of a market-based measure. In line with the commitment of the co-legislators
expressed in Directive (EU) 2018/410, action by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) or the Union
should start from 2023, including preparatory work on adoption and implementation of a measure ensuring that
the sector duly contributes to the efforts needed to achieve the objectives agreed under the Paris Agreement, and
due consideration being given by all stakeholders.
```
```
(19) Pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/410, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council
on the progress achieved in the IMO towards an ambitious emission reduction objective, and on accompanying
measures to ensure that maritime transport duly contributes to the efforts needed to achieve the objectives agreed
under the Paris Agreement. Efforts to limit global maritime emissions through the IMO are under way and should
be encouraged, including the rapid implementation of the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas
Emissions from Ships, adopted in 2018, which also refers to possible market-based measures to incentivise
greenhouse gas emission reductions from international shipping. However, while recently there has been progress
in the IMO, this has so far not been sufficient to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Given the
international character of shipping, it is important that the Member States and the Union within their respective
competences work with third countries to step up diplomatic efforts to strengthen global measures and make
progress on the development of a global market-based measure at IMO level.

```

```
(20) Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from maritime transport account for around 3 to 4 % of Union emissions. In the
European Green Deal, the Commission stated its intention to take additional measures to address greenhouse gas
emissions from maritime transport through a basket of measures to enable the Union to reach its emission
reduction targets. In this context, Directive 2003/87/EC should be amended to include maritime transport in
the EU ETS in order to ensure that that sector contributes its fair share to the increased climate objectives of the
Union as well as to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, which in Article 4(4) states that developed countries
should continue to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide emission reduction targets, while developing
countries are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets. While
emissions from international aviation outside Europe were to be capped from January 2021 by global market-based
action, an action that caps or puts a price on maritime transport emissions is not yet in place. It is therefore
appropriate that the EU ETS cover a share of the emissions from voyages between a port under the jurisdiction of a
Member State and a port under the jurisdiction of a third country, with the third country being able to decide on
appropriate action in respect of the other share of emissions.
```
```
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime transport should thus include half of the emissions from ships performing
voyages arriving at a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State from a port outside the jurisdiction of a Member
State, half of the emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member
State and arriving at a port outside the jurisdiction of a Member State, all of the emissions from ships performing
voyages arriving at a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member
State, and all of the emissions within a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State. This approach has been noted
as a practical way to solve the issue of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities, which has been a
longstanding challenge in the UNFCCC context. The coverage of a share of the emissions from both incoming and
outgoing voyages between the Union and third countries ensures the effectiveness of the EU ETS, in particular by
increasing the environmental impact of the measure compared to a geographical scope limited to voyages within
the Union, while limiting the risk of evasive port calls and the risk of delocalisation of transhipment activities
outside the Union. To ensure a smooth inclusion of the sector in the EU ETS, the surrendering of allowances by
shipping companies should be gradually increased with respect to verified emissions reported for the years 2024
and 2025.
```
```
To protect the environmental integrity of the system, where fewer allowances are surrendered compared to verified
emissions for maritime transport during those years, once the difference between verified emissions and allowances
surrendered has been established each year, an amount of allowances corresponding to that difference should be
cancelled. From 2026, shipping companies should surrender the number of allowances corresponding to all of
their verified emissions. While the climate impact of maritime transport is mainly due to its CO 2 emissions,
non-CO 2 emissions represent a significant share of emissions from ships. According to the Fourth IMO Greenhouse
Gas Study 2020, methane emissions increased significantly over the period from 2012 to 2018. Methane and
nitrous oxide emissions will likely grow over time, in particular with the development of vessels powered by
liquefied natural gases or other energy sources. The inclusion of methane and nitrous oxide emissions would be
beneficial for environmental integrity and for incentivising good practices. Those emissions should first be included
in Regulation (EU) 2015/757 from 2024, and they should be included in the EU ETS from 2026.
```
```
(21) The extension of the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC to maritime transport will lead to changes in the cost of such
transport. All parts of the Union will be affected by that extension of scope as the goods transported to and from
ports within the Union by maritime transport have their origin or destination in the different Member States,
including in landlocked Member States. The allocation of allowances to be auctioned by the Member States should
therefore, in principle, not change as a consequence of the inclusion of maritime transport activities, and should
include all Member States. However, Member States will be affected to different extents. In particular, Member States
with a high reliance on shipping will be most exposed to the effect of the extension. Member States with a large
maritime sector compared to their relative size will be more affected by the extension of the EU ETS to maritime
transport. It is therefore appropriate to provide additional time-limited assistance to those Member States in the
form of additional allowances to support decarbonisation of maritime activities and for the administrative costs
incurred. The assistance should be gradually introduced in parallel with the introduction of surrender obligations
and thus with the increased effect on those Member States. Within the context of the review of
Directive 2003/87/EC, the Commission should consider the relevance of that additional assistance in light, in
particular, of the development in the number of shipping companies under the responsibility of different Member
States.
```
L 130/138 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
(22) The EU ETS should contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from maritime activities and to
increasing efficiency in relation to such activities. The use of EU ETS revenues pursuant to Article 10(3) of
Directive 2003/87/EC should include, inter alia, the promotion of climate-friendly transport and public transport in
all sectors.
```
```
(23) Renewing fleets of ice-class ships and developing innovative technology that reduces the emissions of such ships will
take time and require financial support. Currently, the design of ice-class ships, which enables them to sail in ice
conditions, leads to such ships consuming more fuel and emitting more than ships of similar size designed for
sailing only in open water. Therefore, a flag-neutral method should be implemented under this Directive allowing
for a reduction, until 31 December 2030 , of allowances to be surrendered by shipping companies on the basis of
their ships’ ice class.
```
```
(24) Islands with no road or rail link with the mainland are more dependent on maritime transport than the other regions
and depend on maritime links for their connectivity. In order to assist islands with a small population to remain
connected following the inclusion of maritime transport activities within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC, it is
appropriate to provide for the possibility for a Member State to request a temporary derogation from the surrender
obligations under that Directive for certain maritime transport activities with islands with a population of fewer
than 200 000permanent residents.
```
```
(25) It should be possible for Member States to request that a transnational public service contract or a transnational
public service obligation between two Member States be temporarily exempted from certain obligations under
Directive 2003/87/EC. That possibility should be limited to connections between a Member State without a land
border with another Member State and the geographically closest Member State, such as the maritime connection
between Cyprus and Greece, which has been absent for over two decades. That temporary derogation would
contribute to addressing the compelling need to provide a service of general interest and ensure connectivity as well
as economic, social and territorial cohesion.
```
```
(26) Taking into account the special characteristics and permanent constraints of the outermost regions of the Union as
recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and given their heavy
dependence on maritime transport, special consideration should be given to preserving the accessibility of such
regions and efficient connectivity by means of maritime transport. Therefore, a temporary derogation from certain
obligations pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC should be provided for emissions from maritime transport activities
between a port located in an outermost region of a Member State and a port located in the same Member State,
including ports located in the same outermost region and in another outermost region of the same Member State.
```
```
(27) The provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC as regards maritime transport activities should be kept under review in light
of future international developments and efforts undertaken to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement,
including the second global stocktake in 2028, and subsequent global stocktakes every five years thereafter,
intended to inform successive NDCs. Those provisions should also be reviewed in the event of the adoption by the
IMO of a global market-based measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. To this end,
the Commission should present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council within 18 months of the
adoption of such a measure and before it becomes operational. The Commission should in that report examine that
global market-based measure as regards its ambition in light of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, its overall
environmental integrity, including in comparison with the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC covering maritime
transport, and any issue related to the coherence of the EU ETS and that measure. In particular, the Commission
should in its report take into account the level of participation in that global market-based measure, its
enforceability, transparency, penalties for non-compliance, the processes for public input, the monitoring, reporting
and verification of emissions, registries and accountability. Where appropriate, the report should be accompanied by
a legislative proposal to amend Directive 2003/87/EC in a manner that is consistent with the Union 2030 climate
target and the climate-neutrality objective set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and with the aim of preserving the
environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action, in order to ensure coherence between the
implementation of the global market-based measure and the EU ETS, while avoiding any significant double burden,
and thereby recalling the Union’s competence to regulate its share of emissions from international shipping
voyages, in line with the obligations of the Paris Agreement.
```

```
(28) With the increased costs of shipping which the extension of Directive 2003/87/EC to maritime transport activities
entails, there is, in the absence of a global market-based measure, a risk of evasion. Evasive port calls to ports
outside of the Union and relocation of transhipment activities to ports outside of the Union will not only diminish
the environmental benefits of internalising the cost of emissions from maritime transport activities but can also lead
to additional emissions due to the extra distance travelled to evade the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC. It is
therefore appropriate to exclude from the definition of ‘port of call’ certain stops at non-Union ports. That
exclusion should be targeted at ports in the Union’s vicinity where the risk of evasion is greatest. A limit of 300
nautical miles from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State constitutes a proportionate response to evasive
behaviour, balancing the additional burden and the risk of evasion. Moreover, the exclusion from the definition of
‘port of call’ should only apply to stops by container ships at certain non-Union ports, where the transhipment of
containers accounts for most container traffic. For such shipments, the risk of evasion, in the absence of mitigating
measures, also consists in port hubs being shifted to ports outside the Union, aggravating the effects of the evasion.
To ensure the proportionality of the measure and that it results in equal treatment, account should be taken of
measures in third countries that have an effect equivalent to Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(29) The Commission should review the functioning of Directive 2003/87/EC in relation to maritime transport activities
in the light of experience in applying that Directive, including detecting evasive behaviour in order to prevent such
behaviour at an early stage, and should then propose measures to ensure the effectiveness of that Directive. Such
measures could include increased surrender requirements for voyages where the evasion risk is higher, such as to
and from a port that is located in the Union’s vicinity, in a third country that has not adopted measures similar to
Directive 2003/87/EC.
```

(30) Emissions from ships below 5 000gross tonnage represent less than 15 % of emissions from ships, taking into
account the scope of application of this Directive, but are emitted by a large number of ships. For reasons of
administrative practicability, it is too early to include ships below 5 000gross tonnage in the EU ETS from the start
of the inclusion of maritime transport, but their inclusion in the future would improve the effectiveness of the EU
ETS and potentially reduce evasive behaviour with the use of ships below the 5 000gross tonnage threshold.
Therefore, no later than 31 December 2026 , the Commission should present a report to the European Parliament
and to the Council in which it should examine the feasibility and economic, environmental and social impacts of
the inclusion in Directive 2003/87/EC of emissions from ships below 5 000gross tonnage, including offshore ships.
```
```
(31) The person or organisation responsible for the compliance with the EU ETS should be the shipping company,
defined as the shipowner or any other organisation or person, such as the manager or the bareboat charterer, that
has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner and that, on assuming such
responsibility, has agreed to take over all the duties and responsibilities imposed by the International Management
Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention. This definition is based on the definition of
‘company’ in Article 3, point (d), of Regulation (EU) 2015/757, and in line with the global data collection system
established in 2016 by the IMO.
```
```
(32) The emissions from a ship depend, inter alia, on the vessel energy efficiency measures taken by the shipowner, and
on the fuel, the cargo carried and the route and the speed of the ship, which can be under the control of a different
entity from the shipowner. The responsibilities for purchasing fuel or taking operational decisions that affect the
greenhouse gas emissions of the ship can be assumed by an entity other than the shipping company under a
contractual arrangement. At the time the contract is negotiated, the latter aspects, in particular, would not be
known and thus the ultimate emissions from the ship covered by Directive 2003/87/EC would be uncertain.
However, unless the carbon costs were passed on to the entity operating the ship, the incentives to implement
operational measures for fuel efficiency would be limited. In line with the ‘polluter pays’ principle and to encourage
the adoption of efficiency measures and the uptake of cleaner fuels, the shipping company should therefore be
entitled, under national law, to claim reimbursement for the costs arising from the surrender of allowances from the
entity that is directly responsible for the decisions affecting the greenhouse gas emissions of the ship.
```
L 130/140 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
While such a mechanism of reimbursement could be subject to a contractual arrangement, Member States should, to
reduce administrative costs, not be obliged to ensure or check the existence of such contracts, but should instead
provide for, in national law, a statutory entitlement for the shipping company to be reimbursed and the
corresponding access to justice to enforce that entitlement. For the same reasons, that entitlement, including any
possible conflict relating to the reimbursement between the shipping company and the entity operating the ship,
should not affect the obligations of the shipping company vis-à-vis the administering authority in respect of a
shipping company or the enforcement measures that might be necessary against such a company to ensure there is
full compliance by that company with Directive 2003/87/EC. At the same time, as the purpose served by the
provision concerning the entitlement to reimbursement is closely connected with the Union, in particular in
relation to the compliance with obligations under this Directive by a shipping company vis-à-vis a given Member
State, it is important that that entitlement be observed throughout the Union, in all contractual relations that allow
an entity other than the shipowner to determine the cargo carried or the route and the speed of the ship, in a
manner that safeguards undistorted competition in the internal market, which can include provisions preventing
parties to such contractual agreements from circumventing the entitlement to reimbursement by including a choice
of law clause.
```
```
(33) In order to reduce the administrative burden on shipping companies, one Member State should be responsible for
each shipping company. The Commission should publish an initial list of shipping companies that performed a
maritime transport activity falling within the scope of the EU ETS, which specifies the administering authority in
respect of a shipping company. The list should be updated regularly and at least every two years to reattribute
shipping companies to another such administering authority as relevant. For shipping companies registered in a
Member State, the administering authority in respect of a shipping company should be that Member State. For
shipping companies registered in a third country, the administering authority in respect of a shipping company
should be the Member State in which the shipping company had the greatest estimated number of port calls from
voyages falling within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC in the preceding four monitoring years. For shipping
companies which are registered in a third country and which did not perform any voyage falling within the scope of
Directive 2003/87/EC in the preceding four monitoring years, the administering authority in respect of a shipping
company should be the Member State where a ship of the shipping company started or ended its first voyage falling
within the scope of that Directive. The Commission should publish and update, as relevant, on a biennial basis a list
of shipping companies falling within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC, specifying the administering authority in
respect of a shipping company. In order to ensure equal treatment of shipping companies, Member States should
follow harmonised rules for the administration of shipping companies for which they have responsibility, in
accordance with detailed rules to be established by the Commission.
```
```
(34) Member States should ensure that the shipping companies that they administer comply with the requirements of
Directive 2003/87/EC. In the event that a shipping company fails to comply with those requirements and any
enforcement measures taken by the administering authority in respect of a shipping company have failed to ensure
compliance, Member States should act in solidarity. As a last resort measure, Member States, except for the Member
State whose flag the ship is flying, should be able to refuse entry to the ships under the responsibility of the shipping
company concerned, and the Member State whose flag the ship is flying should be able to detain that ship.
```
```
(35) Shipping companies should monitor and report their aggregated emissions data from maritime transport activities at
company level in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/757. The reports on aggregated
emissions data at company level should be verified in accordance with the rules laid down in that Regulation. When
performing verification at company level, the verifier should not verify the emissions reports at ship level or the
reports at ship level to be submitted where there is a change of company, as those reports at ship level will have
been already verified.
```
```
(36) Based on experience from similar tasks related to environmental protection, the European Maritime Safety Agency
(EMSA) or another relevant organisation should, as appropriate and in accordance with its mandate, assist the
Commission and the administering authorities in respect of a shipping company in relation to the implementation
of Directive 2003/87/EC. Owing to its experience with the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2015/757 and its IT
tools, EMSA should assist the administering authorities in respect of a shipping company, in particular as regards
the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions generated by maritime transport activities under the scope
of Directive 2003/87/EC, by facilitating the exchange of information or developing guidelines and criteria. The
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/


```
Commission, assisted by EMSA, should endeavour to develop appropriate monitoring tools, as well as guidance to
facilitate and coordinate verification and enforcement activities related to the application of Directive 2003/87/EC
to maritime transport. As far as practicable, such tools should be made available to the Member States and the
verifiers in order to better ensure robust enforcement of the national measures transposing Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(37) In parallel to the adoption of this Directive, Regulation (EU) 2015/757 is being amended to provide for monitoring,
reporting and verification rules that are necessary for an extension of the EU ETS to maritime transport activities and
to provide for the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions of additional greenhouse gases and emissions
from additional ship types.
```
```
(38) Regulation (EU) 2017/2392 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^13 )amended Article 12(3) of
Directive 2003/87/EC to allow all operators to use all allowances that are issued. The requirement for greenhouse
gas emissions permits to contain an obligation to surrender allowances, pursuant to Article 6(2), point (e), of that
Directive, should be aligned accordingly.
```
```
(39) Achieving the Union’s emission reduction target for 2030 will require a reduction in the emissions of the sectors
covered by the EU ETS of 62 % compared to 2005. The Union-wide quantity of allowances of the EU ETS needs to
be reduced to create the necessary long-term carbon price signal and impetus for that degree of decarbonisation.
The total quantity of allowances should be reduced in 2024 and 2026 to bring it more in line with actual emissions.
Moreover, the linear reduction factor should be increased in 2024 and in 2028, also taking into account the
inclusion of emissions from maritime transport. The steeper cap trajectory resulting from those changes will lead to
significantly greater levels of cumulative emission reductions up to 2030 than would have occurred pursuant to
Directive (EU) 2018/410. The figures relating to the inclusion of maritime transport should be derived from the
emissions from maritime transport activities that are addressed in Article 3ga of Directive 2003/87/EC and
reported in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/757 for 2018 and 2019 in the Union and the States of the
European Economic Area and the European Free Trade Association, adjusted, from 2021 until 2024, by the linear
reduction factor for the year 2024. The linear reduction factor should be applied in 2024 to the increase of the
Union-wide quantity of allowances in that year.
```
```
(40) Achieving the increased climate ambition will require substantial public and private resources in the Union as well as
in Member States to be dedicated to the climate transition. To complement and reinforce the substantial climate-
related spending in the Union budget, all auction revenues that are not attributed to the Union budget in the form
of own resources, or the equivalent financial value of such auction revenues, should be used for climate-related
purposes, with the exception of the revenues used for the compensation of indirect carbon costs. The list of climate-
related purposes in Article 10(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC should be expanded to cover additional purposes with a
positive environmental impact. This should include use for financial support to address social aspects in lower- and
middle-income households by reducing distortive taxes and targeted reductions of duties and charges for renewable
electricity. Member States should report annually on the use of auctioning revenues in accordance with Article 19 of
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^14 ), specifying, where relevant and as
appropriate, which revenues are used and the actions that are taken to implement their integrated national energy
and climate plans and their territorial just transition plans.

Therefore, Member States are encouraged to increase the use of EU ETS revenues pursuant to Article 10(3) of

ecosystems, in particular marine protected areas.

(42) Significant financial resources are needed to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement in developing countries and
the Glasgow Climate Pact urges developed country Parties to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of
climate finance. In its conclusions on the Preparations for the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP
27), the Council recalls that the Union and its Member States are the largest contributor to international public
climate finance and have more than doubled their contribution to climate finance to support developing countries
since 2013. In those conclusions, the Council also renews the strong commitment made by the Union and its
Member States to continue scaling up their international climate finance towards the developed countries’ goal of
mobilising at least USD 100 billion per year as soon as possible and through to 2025 from a wide variety of
sources, and expects the goal to be met in 2023.
```
```
(43) To address the distributional and social effects of the transition in low-income Member States, an additional amount
of 2,5 % of the Union-wide quantity of allowances from 2024 to 2030 should be used to fund the energy transition
of the Member States with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita below 75 % of the Union average in the years
2016 to 2018, through the Modernisation Fund referred to in Article 10d of Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(44) The beneficiary Member States should be able to use the resources allocated to the Modernisation Fund to finance
investments involving the adjacent Union border regions when this is relevant to the energy transition of
beneficiary Member States.
```
```
(45) Further incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using cost-efficient techniques should be provided. To that
end, the free allocation of emission allowances to stationary installations from 2026 onwards should be conditional
on investments in techniques to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions, in particular for large energy users.
The Commission should ensure that the application of that conditionality does not jeopardise a level playing field,
environmental integrity or equal treatment of installations across the Union. The Commission should therefore,
without prejudice to the rules applicable under Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council(^15 ), adopt delegated acts supplementing this Directive to address any issue identified in particular on the
above-mentioned principles and provide for administratively simple rules for the application of the conditionality.
Those rules should be part of the general rules on free allocation, using the established procedure for national
implementing measures, and provide for timelines, for criteria for the recognition of implemented energy efficiency
measures, as well as for alternative measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, incentives to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions should be further reinforced for installations with high greenhouse gas emission
intensities. To that end, from 2026 onwards, the free allocation of emission allowances to the 20 % stationary
installations with the highest emission intensities under a given product benchmark should also be conditional on
the setting-up and implementation of climate-neutrality plans.
```
```
(46) The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), established under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European
Parliament and of the Council(^16 ), is set to replace the mechanisms established under Directive 2003/87/EC to
prevent the risk of carbon leakage. To the extent that sectors and subsectors are covered by that measure, they
should not receive free allocation. However, a transitional phasing-out of free allowances is needed to allow
producers, importers and traders to adjust to the new regime. The reduction of free allocation should be
implemented by applying a factor to free allocation for CBAM sectors, while CBAM is phased in. The CBAM factor
should be equal to 100 % for the period between the entry into force of that Regulation and the end of 2025, and
subject to the application of provisions referred to in Article 36(2), point (b), of that Regulation, should be equal to
97,5 % in 2026, 95 % in 2027, 90 % in 2028, 77,5 % in 2029, 51,5 % in 2030, 39 % in 2031, 26,5 % in 2032
and 14 % in 2033. From 2034, no CBAM factor should apply.

```
The relevant delegated acts on free allocation should be adjusted accordingly for the sectors and subsectors covered
by CBAM. The free allocation no longer provided to the CBAM sectors based on this calculation (CBAM demand) is
to be added to the Innovation Fund, so as to support innovation in low-carbon technologies, carbon capture and
utilisation (CCU), carbon capture, transport and geological storage (CCS), renewable energy and energy storage, in a
way that contributes to mitigating climate change. In this context, special attention should be given to projects in
CBAM sectors. To respect the proportion of the free allocation available for non-CBAM sectors, the final amount to
be deducted from the free allocation and made available under the Innovation Fund should be calculated based on
the proportion that the CBAM demand represents in respect of the free allocation needs of all sectors receiving free
allocation.
```
```
(47) In order to mitigate potential carbon leakage risks related to goods subject to CBAM and produced in the Union for
export to third countries which do not apply the EU ETS or a similar carbon pricing mechanism, an assessment
should be carried out before the end of the transitional period under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Where that
assessment concludes that there is such a carbon leakage risk, the Commission should, where appropriate, submit a
legislative proposal to address that carbon leakage risk in a manner that is compliant with the rules of the World
Trade Organization. Moreover, Member States should be allowed to use auction revenues to address any residual
risk of carbon leakage in CBAM sectors and in accordance with State aid rules. Where allowances coming from a
reduction of free allocation in application of the conditionality rules are not fully used to exempt the installations
with the lowest greenhouse gas emission intensity from the cross-sectoral correction, 50 % of those residual
allowances should be added to the Innovation Fund. The other 50 % should be auctioned on behalf of Member
States and they should use the revenue therefrom to address any residual risk of carbon leakage in CBAM sectors.
```
```
(48) In order to better reflect technological progress while ensuring emission reduction incentives and properly
rewarding innovation, the minimum adjustment of the benchmark values should be increased from 0,2 % to 0,3 %
per year, and the maximum adjustment should be increased from 1,6 % to 2,5 % per year. For the period from
2026 to 2030, the benchmark values should thus be adjusted within a range of 6 % to 50 % compared to the value
applicable in the period from 2013 to 2020. In order to provide predictability to installations, the Commission
should adopt implementing acts determining the revised benchmark values for free allocation as soon as possible
before the start of the period from 2026 to 2030.
```
```
(49) To incentivise new breakthrough technologies in the steel industry and to avoid a significantly disproportionate
reduction of the benchmark value and in light of the particular situation of the steel industry such as the high
emission intensity and the international and Union market structure, it is necessary to exclude from the calculation
of the hot metal benchmark value for the period from 2026 to 2030 installations that were operational during the
reference period from 2021 to 2022 and that would otherwise be included in that calculation due to the review of
the definition of the product benchmark for hot metal.
```
```
(50) To reward best performers and innovation, installations whose greenhouse gas emission levels are below the average
of the 10 % most efficient installations under a given benchmark should be excluded from the application of the
cross-sectoral correction factor. Allowances that are not allocated due to a reduction of free allocation in application
of the conditionality rules should be used to cover the deficit in the reduction of free allocation resulting from
excluding best performers from the application of the cross-sectoral correction factor.
```
```
(51) In order to speed up the decarbonisation of the economy while strengthening the industrial competitiveness of the
Union, an additional 20 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be allocated for free and an
additional 5 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be auctioned should be made available to
the Innovation Fund. When reviewing the timing and sequencing of the auctioning for the Innovation Fund
established in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010(^17 )in view of the changes introduced by this Directive,
the Commission should consider making available larger amounts of resources in the first years of implementation
of the revised Directive 2003/87/EC to boost the decarbonisation of relevant sectors.

(52) A comprehensive approach to innovation is essential for achieving the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. At
Union level, the necessary research and innovation efforts are supported, among other things, through Horizon
Europe, which includes significant funding and new instruments for the sectors coming under the EU ETS.
Consequently, the Commission should seek synergies with Horizon Europe and, where relevant, with other Union
funding programmes.
```
```
(53) The Innovation Fund should support innovative techniques, processes and technologies, including the scaling-up of
such techniques, processes and technologies, with a view to their broad roll-out across the Union. Breakthrough
innovation should be prioritised in the selection of projects supported through grants.
```
```
(54) The scope of the Innovation Fund referred to in Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC should be extended to
support innovation in low- and zero-carbon technologies and processes that concern the consumption of fuels in
the buildings, road transport and additional sectors, including collective forms of transport such as public transport
and coach services. In addition, the Innovation Fund should serve to support investments to decarbonise maritime
transport, including investments in energy efficiency of ships, ports and short-sea shipping, in electrification of the
sector, in sustainable alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia that are produced from renewables, in zero-
emission propulsion technologies such as wind technologies, and in innovations with regard to ice-class ships.
Special attention should be given to innovative projects contributing to decarbonising the maritime sector and
reducing all of its climate impacts, including black carbon emissions. In that respect, the Commission should
provide for dedicated topics in Innovation Fund calls for proposals. Those calls should take biodiversity protection,
noise and water pollution issues into account. As far as maritime transport is concerned, projects with clear added
value for the Union should be eligible.

operate flights covered by the EU ETS, their accounts are set to ‘excluded’ status, and processes may no longer be
initiated from those accounts. To preserve the environmental integrity of the EU ETS, allowances which are not
issued to aircraft operators, due to them ceasing operations, should be used to cover any shortfall in surrenders by
those operators, and any leftover allowances should be used to accelerate action to tackle climate change by being
placed in the Innovation Fund.

```
(56) Technical assistance from the Commission focused on Member States from which few or no projects have been
submitted so far would contribute to achieving a high number of project applications for funding by the Innovation
Fund across all Member States. That assistance should, among other things, support activities aimed at improving
the quality of proposals for projects located in the Member States from which few or no projects have been
submitted, for example through sharing information, lessons learned and best practice, and at boosting the activities
of national contact points. Other measures serving the same aim include measures to raise awareness of funding
options and increase the capacity of those Member States to identify and support potential project applicants.
Project partnerships across Member States and matchmaking between potential applicants, in particular for large-
scale projects, should also be promoted.
```
```
(57) In order to improve the role of Member States in the governance of the Innovation Fund and increase transparency,
the Commission should report to the Climate Change Committee on the implementation of the Innovation Fund,
providing an analysis of the expected impact of awarded projects by sector and by Member State. The Commission
should also provide the report to the European Parliament and to the Council and make it public. Subject to the
agreement of applicants, following the closure of a call for proposals, the Commission should inform Member
States of the applications for funding of projects in their respective territories and should provide them with
detailed information of those applications in order to facilitate the Member States’ coordination of the support to
projects. In addition, the Commission should inform the Member States about the list of pre-selected projects prior
to the award of the support. Member States should ensure that the national transposition provisions do not hamper
innovation and are technologically neutral, while the Commission should provide technical assistance, in particular

```
(58) In order to align with the comprehensive nature of the European Green Deal, the selection process for projects
supported through grants should give priority to projects addressing multiple environmental impacts. In order to
support the replication and the faster market penetration of the technologies or solutions that are supported,
projects funded by the Innovation Fund should share knowledge with other relevant projects as well as with Union-
based researchers having a legitimate interest.
```
```
(59) Contracts for difference (CDs), carbon contracts for difference (CCDs) and fixed premium contracts are important
elements for the triggering of emission reductions in industry through the scaling-up of new technologies, offering
the opportunity to guarantee investors in innovative climate-friendly technologies a price that rewards CO 2
emission reductions above those induced by the prevailing carbon price level in the EU ETS. The range of measures
that the Innovation Fund can support should be extended to provide support to projects through competitive
bidding, leading to the award of CDs, CCDs or fixed premium contracts. Competitive bidding would be an
important mechanism for supporting the development of decarbonisation technologies and optimising the use of
available resources. It would also offer certainty to investors in those technologies. With a view to minimising any
contingent liability for the Union budget, risk mitigation should be ensured in the design of CDs and CCDs and
appropriate coverage by a budgetary commitment should be provided with full coverage at least for the first two
rounds of CDs and CCDs with appropriations resulting from the proceeds of auctioning of allowances allocated
pursuant to Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
No such risks exist for fixed premium contracts because the legal commitment will be covered by a matching
budgetary commitment. In addition, the Commission should conduct, after concluding the first two rounds of CDs
and CCDs, and each time it is necessary thereafter, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the financial risks
arising from their implementation. The Commission should be empowered to adopt a delegated act to provide,
based on the results of that assessment, for an appropriate provisioning rate rather than full coverage for
subsequent rounds of CDs or CCDs. Such an approach should take into account any elements that could reduce the
financial risks for the Union budget, in addition to the allowances available in the Innovation Fund, such as possible
sharing of liability with Member States, on a voluntary basis, or a possible re-insurance mechanism from the private
sector. It is therefore necessary to provide for derogations from parts of Title X of Regulation (EU,
Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^19 ). The provisioning rate for the first two
rounds of CDs and CCDs should be 100 %.
```
```
However, by way of derogation from Article 210(1), Article 211(1) and (2) and Article 218(1) of that Regulation, a
minimum provisioning rate of 50 % as well as a maximum share of revenue from the Innovation Fund to be used
for provisioning of 30 % should be set in this Directive for subsequent rounds of CDs and CCDs and the
Commission should be able to specify the provisioning rate necessary on the basis of the experience from the first
two calls for proposals and the amount of revenue to be used for provisioning. The total financial liability borne by
the Union budget should thus not exceed 60 % of the proceeds from auctioning for the Innovation Fund. Moreover,
as provisioning will come, in general, from the Innovation Fund, derogations should be made from the rules in

(61) Where an installation’s activity is temporarily suspended, free allocation is adjusted to the activity levels which are
mandatorily reported annually. In addition, competent authorities can suspend the issuance of emission allowances
to installations that have suspended operations as long as there is no evidence that they will resume operations.
Therefore, operators should no longer be required to demonstrate to the competent authority that their installation
will resume production within a specified and reasonable time in the event of a temporary suspension of the
activities.
```
```
(62) Corrections of free allocation granted to stationary installations pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC
can require granting additional free allowances or transferring back surplus allowances. The allowances set aside for
new entrants under Article 10a(7) of Directive 2003/87/EC should be used for those purposes.
```
```
(63) Since 2013, electricity producers have been obliged to purchase all the allowances they need to generate electricity.
Nevertheless, in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC, some Member States have the option of
providing transitional free allocation for the modernisation of the energy sector for the period from 2021 to 2030.
Three Member States have chosen to use that option. Given the need for rapid decarbonisation, especially in the
energy sector, the Member States concerned should only be able to provide this transitional free allocation for
investments carried out until 31 December 2024. They should be able to add any remaining allowances for the
period from 2021 to 2030 that are not used for such investments, in the proportion they determine, to the total
quantity of allowances that the Member State concerned receives for auctioning, or use them to support
investments within the framework of the Modernisation Fund. With the exception of the deadline for notification
thereof, allowances transferred to the Modernisation Fund should be subject to the same rules concerning
investments that are applicable to the allowances already transferred pursuant to Article 10d(4) of
Directive 2003/87/EC. To ensure predictability and transparency with regard to the amount of allowances available
either for auctioning or for the transitional free allocation, and with regard to the assets managed by the
Modernisation Fund, Member States should inform the Commission of the amounts of remaining allowances to be
used for each purpose, respectively, by 15 May 2024.
```
```
(64) The scope of the Modernisation Fund should be aligned with the most recent climate objectives of the Union by
requiring that investments are consistent with the objectives of the European Green Deal and Regulation
(EU) 2021/1119, and eliminating the support to any investments related to energy generation based on fossil fuels,
except as regards the support for such investments with revenue from allowances voluntarily transferred to the
Modernisation Fund in accordance with Article 10d(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. In addition, limited support for
such investments should continue to be possible with revenue from the allocations referred to in Article 10(1), third
subparagraph, of that Directive under certain conditions, in particular where the activity qualifies as environmentally
sustainable under Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^21 )and as regards the
allowances auctioned until 2027. For the latter category of allowances, the downstream uses of non-solid fossil
fuels should, in addition, not be supported with revenue from allowances auctioned after 2028. Furthermore, the
percentage of the Modernisation Fund that needs to be devoted to priority investments should be increased to 80 %
for the Modernisation Fund allowances transferred in accordance with Article 10d(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC and
referred to in Article 10(1), third subparagraph, of that Directive, and to 90 % for the additional amount of 2,5 %
from the Union-wide quantity of allowances.
```
```
Energy efficiency including in industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and waste; heating and cooling from
renewable sources; as well as support for households to address energy poverty, including in rural and remote areas,
should be included within the scope of the priority investments. In order to increase transparency and better assess
the impact of the Modernisation Fund, the Investment Committee should report annually to the Climate Change
Committee on experience with the evaluation of investments, in particular in terms of emission reductions and
abatement costs.

their auction volume in respect of closures of electricity-generation capacity in their territory. In view of the
increased climate ambition of the Union and the resulting accelerated decarbonisation of the electricity sector, such
cancellation has become increasingly relevant. Therefore, the Commission should assess whether the use by
Member States of cancellation can be facilitated by amending the relevant delegated acts adopted pursuant to
Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.

(66) Adjustments to free allocation introduced in Directive (EU) 2018/410 and put into effect by Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1842(^22 )improved the efficiency and incentives provided by free allocation,
but increased the administrative burden and rendered the historical date of issuance of free allocation of 28
February inoperative. In order to better take into account the adjustments to free allocation, it is appropriate to
make adjustments to the compliance cycle. The deadline for competent authorities to grant free allocation should
therefore be postponed from 28 February to 30 June and the deadline for operators to surrender allowances should
be postponed from 30 April to 30 September.

(67) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066(^23 )lays down rules on the monitoring of emissions from
biomass, which are consistent with the rules on the use of biomass laid down in the Union legislation on renewable
energy. As the legislation becomes more elaborate on the sustainability criteria for biomass with the latest rules
established in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^24 ), the conferral of
implementing powers in Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC should be explicitly extended to the adoption of the
necessary adjustments for the application in the EU ETS of sustainability criteria for biomass, including biofuels,
bioliquids and biomass fuels. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts to
specify how to account for the storage of emissions from mixes of zero-rated biomass and biomass that is not from
zero-rated sources.
```
```
(68) Renewable liquid and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels can be important for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise. Where recycled carbon fuels and renewable liquid
and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin are produced from captured CO 2 under an activity covered by this
Directive, the emissions should be accounted for under that activity. To ensure that renewable fuels of non-
biological origin and recycled carbon fuels contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions, and to avoid double
counting for fuels that do so, it is appropriate to explicitly extend the empowerment in Article 14(1) of
Directive 2003/87/EC to the adoption by the Commission of implementing acts laying down the necessary
adjustments for how to account for the eventual release of CO 2 , in a way that ensures that all emissions are
accounted for, including where such fuels are produced from captured CO 2 outside the Union, while avoiding
double counting and ensuring appropriate incentives are in place for capturing emissions, taking also into account
the treatment of those fuels under Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
```
```
(69) As CO 2 is also expected to be transported by means other than pipelines, such as by ship and by truck, the current
coverage in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC for transport of greenhouse gases for the purpose of storage should
be extended to all means of transport for reasons of equal treatment and irrespective of whether the means of
transport are covered by the EU ETS. Where the emissions from the transport are also covered by another activity
under Directive 2003/87/EC, the emissions should be accounted for under that other activity to prevent double
counting.

(70) The exclusion from the EU ETS of installations exclusively using biomass has led to situations where installations
combusting a high share of biomass have obtained windfall profits by receiving free allowances greatly exceeding
actual emissions. Therefore, a threshold value for zero-rated biomass combustion should be introduced, above
which installations are excluded from the EU ETS. The introduction of a threshold would provide more certainty as
to which installations are under the EU ETS scope and would enable free allowances to be more evenly distributed
to sectors more at risk of carbon leakage in particular. The threshold should be set at a level of 95 % to balance the
advantages and disadvantages for installations of remaining under the scope of the EU ETS. Therefore, installations
that have retained the physical capacity to burn fossil fuels should not be incentivised to revert to the use of such
fuels. A threshold of 95 % would ensure that if an installation uses fossil fuels with the purpose of remaining within
the scope of the EU ETS to benefit from free allocation allowances, the carbon costs related to the use of those fossil
fuels would be sufficiently important to act as a disincentive.
```
```
That threshold would also ensure that installations using a sizeable quantity of fossil fuels will remain within the
monitoring obligations of the EU ETS, thus avoiding potential circumvention of existing monitoring, reporting and
verification obligations. At the same time, installations which combust a lower share of zero-rated biomass should
continue to be encouraged, through a flexible mechanism, to reduce fossil fuel combustion further while remaining
under the scope of the EU ETS until their use of sustainable biomass is so substantial that their inclusion under the
EU ETS is no longer justified. In addition, experience has shown that the exclusion of installations exclusively using
biomass, effectively being a 100 % threshold except for the combustion of fossil fuels during start-up and shutdown
phases, requires a reassessment and more precise definition. The 95 % threshold allows for the combustion of fossil
fuels during start-up and shutdown phases.
```
```
(71) In order to incentivise the uptake of low- and zero-carbon technologies, Member States should provide operators
with the options of remaining within the scope of the EU ETS until the end of the current and next five-year period
referred to in Article 11(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC if the installation changes its production process to reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions and no longer meets the threshold of 20 MW of total rated thermal input.
```
```
(72) The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its final report on emission allowances and
associated derivatives on 28 March 2022. The report is a comprehensive analysis of the integrity of the European
carbon market and has provided expertise and recommendations in relation to upholding the proper functioning of
the carbon market. In order to continuously monitor market integrity and transparency, the reporting by ESMA
should be conducted on a regular basis. ESMA is already assessing market developments and, where necessary,
provides recommendations, in the area of its competence, in its report on trends, risks and vulnerabilities in
accordance with Article 32(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the
Council(^25 ). Analysis of the European carbon market, which includes the auctions of emission allowances, on-venue
and over-the-counter trading in emission allowances and derivatives thereof, should be part of that annual reporting.
This obligation would lead to streamlining of the reporting done by ESMA and allow for cross-market comparisons,
in particular due to strong linkages between the EU ETS and commodity derivative markets.
```
```
Such regular analysis by ESMA should in particular monitor any market volatility and price evolution, the operation
of the auctions and trading operations on the markets, liquidity and the volumes traded, and the categories and
trading behaviour of market participants, including speculative activity significantly impacting on prices. Its
assessments should, where relevant, include recommendations to improve market integrity and transparency as well
as reporting obligations, and to enhance the prevention and detection of market abuse and help in maintaining
orderly markets for emission allowances and derivatives thereof. The Commission should take due account of the
assessments and recommendations in the context of the annual carbon market report and, where necessary, in the
reports to ensure the better functioning of the carbon market.

(73) In order to further incentivise investments required for the decarbonisation of district heating and to address social
aspects related to high energy prices and the high greenhouse gas emission intensity of district heating installations,
in Member States with a very high share of emissions from district heating in comparison with the size of the
economy, operators should be able to apply for additional transitional free allocation for district heating
installations and the additional value of the free allocation should be invested to significantly reduce emissions
before 2030. To ensure those reductions take place, the additional transitional free allocation should be conditional
on investments made and on emission reductions achieved as laid down in climate-neutrality plans to be drawn up
by operators for their relevant installations.
```
```
(74) Unexpected or sudden excessive price increases in the carbon market can negatively affect market predictability,
which is essential for the planning of decarbonisation investments. Therefore, the measure which applies in the
event of excessive price fluctuations in the market for emissions allowance trading covered under Chapters II and III
of Directive 2003/87/EC should be strengthened in a careful manner to improve its reactivity to unwarranted price
fluctuations. If the triggering condition based on the increase in the average allowance price is met, this rule-based
safeguard measure should apply automatically, thereby resulting in a release of a predetermined number of
allowances from the market stability reserve established by Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament
and of the Council(^26 ). The triggering condition should be closely monitored by the Commission and published on
a monthly basis in order to improve transparency. To ensure the orderly auctioning of the allowances released from
the market stability reserve pursuant to this safeguard measure and to improve market predictability, this measure
should not apply again until at least twelve months after the end of the previous release of allowances in the market
under the measure.
```
```
(75) The communication of the Commission of 17 September 2020entitled ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate
ambition - Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’ underlined the particular challenge of
reducing the emissions in the buildings and road transport sectors. Therefore, the Commission announced that a
further expansion of emissions trading could include emissions from buildings and road transport, while indicating
that covering all emissions from fuel combustion would present important benefits. Emissions trading should be
applied to fuels used for combustion in the buildings and road transport sectors as well as in additional sectors
which correspond to industrial activities not covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC such as the heating of
industrial facilities (‘buildings, road transport and additional sectors’). For those sectors, a separate but parallel
emissions trading system should be established to avoid any disturbance of the well-functioning emissions trading
system for stationary installations and aviation. The new system is accompanied by complementary policies shaping
expectations of market participants and aiming for a carbon price signal for the whole economy while providing
measures to avoid undue price impacts. Previous experience has shown that the development of the new system
requires setting up an efficient monitoring, reporting and verification system. With a view to ensuring synergies and
consistency with the existing Union infrastructure for the EU ETS, it is appropriate to set up an emissions trading
system for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors via an amendment to Directive 2003/87/ЕC.
```
```
(76) In order to establish the necessary implementation framework and to provide a reasonable timeframe for reaching
the 2030 target, emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors should start in 2025.
During the first years, the regulated entities should be required to hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit and to
report their emissions for the years 2024 to 2026. The issuance of allowances and compliance obligations for those
entities should be applicable as from 2027. This sequencing would allow emissions trading in those sectors to start
in an orderly and efficient manner. It would also allow the measures to be in place to ensure a socially fair
introduction of emissions trading into the buildings, road transport and additional sectors, so as to mitigate the
impact of the carbon price on vulnerable households and transport users.
```
```
(77) Due to the very large number of small emitters in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors, it is not
possible to establish the point of regulation at the level of entities directly emitting greenhouse gases, as is the case
for stationary installations and aviation. Therefore, for reasons of technical feasibility and administrative efficiency,
it is more appropriate to establish the point of regulation further upstream in the supply chain. The act that triggers
the compliance obligation under the new emissions trading system should be the release for consumption of fuels
which are used for combustion in the buildings and road transport sectors, including for road transport of
```
```
(^26 ) Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 2015 concerning the establishment and
operation of a market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme and amending Directive 2003/87/EC
(OJ L 264, 9.10.2015, p. 1).
```
L 130/150 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
greenhouse gases for the purpose of their geological storage, as well as in the additional sectors which correspond to
industrial activities not covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC. To avoid double coverage, the release for
consumption of fuels which are used in activities under Annex I to that Directive should not be covered.
```
```
(78) The regulated entities in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors and the point of regulation should be
defined in line with the system of excise duty established by Council Directive (EU) 2020/262(^27 ), with the
necessary adaptations, as that Directive already lays down a robust control system for all quantities of fuels released
for consumption for the purposes of paying excise duties. Final consumers of fuels in those sectors should not be
subject to obligations under Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(79) The regulated entities falling within the scope of the emissions trading system in the buildings, road transport and
additional sectors should be subject to similar greenhouse gas emissions permit requirements as the operators of
stationary installations. It is necessary to establish rules on permit applications, conditions for permit issuance,
content, and review, and any changes related to the regulated entity. In order for the new system to start in an
orderly manner, Member States should ensure that regulated entities falling within the scope of the new emissions
trading system have a valid permit as of the start of the system in 2025.
```
```
(80) The total quantity of allowances for the new emissions trading system should follow a linear trajectory to reach the
emission reduction target for 2030, taking into account the cost-efficient contribution of the buildings and road
transport sectors of 43 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 and of the additional sectors, a
combined cost-efficient contribution of 42 % emission reductions by 2030 compared to 2005. The total quantity of
allowances should be established for the first time in 2027, to follow a trajectory starting in 2024 from the value of
the 2024 emissions limits, calculated in accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European
Parliament and of the Council(^28 )on the basis of the reference emissions for the sectors covered for 2005 and the
period from 2016 to 2018 as determined under Article 4(3) of that Regulation. Accordingly, the linear reduction
factor should be set at 5,10 %. From 2028, the total quantity of allowances should be set on the basis of the average
reported emissions for the years 2024, 2025 and 2026, and should decrease by the same absolute annual reduction
rate as set from 2024, which corresponds to a 5,38 % linear reduction factor compared to the comparable 2025
value of the above defined trajectory. If those emissions are significantly higher than that trajectory value and if
such divergence is not due to small-scale differences in emission measurement methodologies, the linear reduction
factor should be adjusted to reach the required level of emission reduction in 2030.
```
```
(81) The auctioning of allowances is the simplest and the most economically efficient method for allocating emission
allowances, and also avoids windfall profits. Both the buildings and road transport sectors are under relatively little
or non-existent competitive pressure from outside the Union and are not exposed to a risk of carbon leakage.
Therefore, allowances for buildings and road transport should only be allocated via auctioning, without there being
any free allocation.
```
```
(82) In order to ensure a smooth start to the new emissions trading system and taking into account the need of the
regulated entities to hedge or buy ahead allowances to mitigate their price and liquidity risk, a higher amount of
allowances should be auctioned early on. In 2027, the auction volumes should therefore be 30 % higher than the
total quantity of allowances for 2027. This amount would be sufficient to provide liquidity, both if emissions
decrease in line with the reductions needed, and in the event that emission reductions only materialise progressively.
The detailed rules for that front-loading of auction volumes should be established in a delegated act related to
auctioning, adopted pursuant to Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.

(83) The distribution rules on auction shares are highly relevant for any auction revenues that would accrue to the
Member States, especially in view of the need to strengthen the ability of the Member States to address the social
impacts of a carbon price signal in the buildings and road transport sectors. Notwithstanding the fact that those
buildings, road transport and additional sectors have very different characteristics, it is appropriate to set a common
distribution rule similar to the one applicable to stationary installations. The majority of the allowances should be
distributed among all Member States on the basis of the average distribution of the emissions in road
transportation, commercial and institutional buildings and residential buildings, during the period from 2016 to
2018.
```
```
(84) The introduction of the carbon price in the buildings and road transport sectors should be accompanied by effective
social compensation, especially in view of the existing levels of energy poverty. About 34 million Europeans, nearly
6,9 % of the Union population, have said that they cannot afford to heat their home sufficiently in a 2021 Union-
wide survey. To achieve effective social and distributional compensation, Member States should be required to
spend the auction revenues from emissions trading for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors on the
climate and energy-related purposes already specified for the existing emissions trading system, giving priority to
activities that can contribute to addressing social aspects of the emissions trading in the buildings, road transport
and additional sectors, or for measures added specifically to address related concerns for those sectors, including
related policy measures under Directive 2012/27/EU.

A new Social Climate Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the
Council(^29 )will provide dedicated funding to Member States to support the most affected vulnerable groups,
especially households in energy or transport poverty. The Social Climate Fund will promote fairness and solidarity
between and within Member States while mitigating the risk of energy and transport poverty during the transition.
It will build on and complement existing solidarity mechanisms, in synergy with other Union spending
programmes and funds. 50 million allowances from the EU ETS pursuant to Article 10a(8b) of
Directive 2003/87/EC and 150 million allowances from emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and
additional sectors, and revenue generated from the auctioning of allowances concerning the buildings, road
transport and additional sectors, up to a maximum of EUR 65 000 000 000, should be used for the financing of the
Social Climate Fund in the form of external assigned revenue on a temporary and exceptional basis, pending the
discussions and deliberations on the Commission’s proposal of 22 December 2021 for a Council Decision
amending Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 on the system of own resources of the European Union concerning
the establishment of a new own resource based on the EU ETS in accordance with Article 311, third paragraph,

```
It is necessary to provide that, where a decision is adopted in accordance with Article 311, third paragraph, TFEU
establishing that new own resource, the same revenue should cease to be externally assigned when such a decision
enters into force. With regard to the Social Climate Fund, the Commission is, in the event of the adoption of such a
decision, to present, as appropriate, the necessary proposals in accordance with Article 27(4) of Regulation
(EU) 2023/955. This is without prejudice to the outcome of the post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework

emissions corresponding to the quantities of fuels they have released for consumption. They should surrender
allowances for the first time for their verified emissions in 2027. In order to minimise the administrative burden, a
number of rules applicable to the existing emissions trading system for stationary installations and aviation should
be made applicable to the new emissions trading system for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors,

(87) Certain Member States already have national carbon taxes that apply to the buildings, road transport and additional
sectors covered by Annex III to Directive 2003/87/EC. Therefore, a temporary derogation should be introduced until
the end of 2030. To ensure the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC are achieved and that the new emissions trading
system is coherent, the option of applying that derogation should only be available where the national tax rate is
higher than the average auctioning price for the relevant year, and should only apply to the surrender obligation of
the regulated entities paying such a tax. To ensure stability and transparency of the system, the national tax,
including the relevant tax rates, should be notified to the Commission by the end of the transposition period of this
Directive. The derogation should not affect the external assigned revenue for the Social Climate Fund or, if
established in accordance with Article 311, third paragraph, TFEU, an own resource based on the auctioning
revenues from emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors.
```
```
(88) For emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors to be effective, it should be possible to
monitor emissions with high certainty and at reasonable cost. Emissions should be attributed to regulated entities
on the basis of fuel quantities released for consumption and combined with an emission factor. Regulated entities
should be able to reliably and accurately identify and differentiate the sectors in which the fuels are released for
consumption, as well as the final users of the fuels, in order to avoid undesirable effects, such as a double burden. In
the small number of cases where double counting between emissions in the existing EU ETS and the new emissions
trading system for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors cannot be avoided, or where costs arise due to
the surrender of allowances for emissions from activities not covered by Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States
should use such revenue to compensate for the unavoidable double counting or other such costs outside the
buildings, road transport and additional sectors in accordance with Union law. Implementing powers should
therefore be conferred on the Commission to ensure uniform conditions for avoiding double counting and
allowances being surrendered for emissions not covered by the emissions trading system for buildings, road
transport and additional sectors, and for providing financial compensation. To further mitigate any issues of double
counting, the deadlines for monitoring and surrendering in the new emissions trading system should be one month
after the deadlines in the existing system for stationary installations and aviation. To have sufficient data to establish
the total quantity of allowances for the period from 2028 to 2030, the regulated entities holding a permit at the start
of the system in 2025 should report their associated historical emissions for 2024.
```
```
(89) Transparency as regards carbon costs and the extent to which they are passed on to consumers is of key importance
for enabling swift and cost-efficient emission reductions in all sectors of the economy. This is of particular
importance in an emissions trading system which is based on upstream obligations. The new emissions trading
system is meant to incentivise regulated entities to reduce the carbon content of the fuels, and such entities should
not make undue profits by passing on more carbon costs to consumers than they incur. While full auctioning of
emissions allowances under the emissions trading system for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors
already limits the occurrence of such undue profits, the Commission should monitor the extent to which regulated
entities pass on carbon costs, so that windfall profits are avoided. In relation to Chapter IVa, the Commission should
report annually, where possible by type of fuel, on the average level of the carbon costs which have been passed on
to consumers in the Union.
```
```
(90) It is appropriate to introduce measures to address the potential risk of excessive price increases, which, if particularly
high at the start of the new emissions trading system, may undermine the readiness of households and individuals to
invest in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Those measures should complement the safeguards provided by
the market stability reserve and that became operational in 2019. While the market will continue to determine the
carbon price, safeguard measures will be triggered by a rules-based automatic mechanism, whereby allowances will
be released from the market stability reserve only if one or more concrete triggering conditions based on the
increase in the average allowance price are met. This additional mechanism should also be highly reactive, in order
to address excessive volatility due to factors other than changed market fundamentals. The measures should be
adapted to different levels of excessive price increase, which will result in different degrees of intervention. The
triggering conditions should be closely monitored by the Commission and the measures should be adopted by the
Commission as a matter of urgency when those conditions are met. This should be without prejudice to any
accompanying measures that Member States might adopt to address adverse social impacts.
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/


```
(91) In order to increase certainty for citizens that the carbon price in the initial years of the new emissions trading
system does not go above EUR 45, it is appropriate to include an additional price stability mechanism to release
allowances from the market stability reserve in the event the carbon price exceeds that level. In principle, the
measure should apply once during a period of 12 months. However, it should also be able to apply again during the
same period of 12 months where the Commission, assisted by the Climate Change Committee, considers that the
evolution of the price justifies another release of allowances. In view of the aim of this mechanism to ensure
stability in the initial years of the new emissions trading system, the Commission should assess its functioning and
whether it should be continued after 2029.
```
```
(92) As an additional safeguard mechanism ahead of the start of emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and
additional sectors, it should be possible to delay the application of the cap and the surrendering obligations where
gas or oil wholesale prices are exceptionally high compared to historical trends. The mechanism should be
automatic, meaning that the application of the cap and the surrendering obligations is to be delayed by one year if
concrete energy price triggers are met. The reference prices should be determined on the basis of benchmark
contracts in the gas and oil wholesale markets which are immediately available and the most relevant for final
consumers. Separate trigger conditions for gas and oil prices should be envisaged, as their price developments
follow different historical trends. In order to ensure market certainty, the Commission should provide clarity on the
application of the delay sufficiently in advance, through a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
```
```
(93) The application of emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors should be monitored by
the Commission, including the degree of price convergence with the existing EU ETS, and, if necessary, a review
should be proposed to the European Parliament and to the Council to improve the effectiveness, administration and
practical application of emissions trading for those sectors on the basis of acquired knowledge as well as increased
price convergence. The Commission should be required to submit the first report on those matters by 1 January
2028.
```
```
(94) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Article 3ga(2), Article 3gf(2) and (4),
Article 10b(4), Article 12(3-d) and (3-c), Article 14(1), Article 30f(3) and (5) and Article 30h(7) of
Directive 2003/87/EC, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. To ensure synergies with the
existing regulatory framework, the conferral of implementing powers in Articles 14 and 15 of that Directive should
be extended to cover the buildings, road transport and additional sectors. Those implementing powers, except the
implementing powers in relation to Article 3gf(2) and Article 12(3-d) and (3-c) of Directive 2003/87/EC, should be
exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^30 ).
```
```
(95) In order to achieve the objectives laid down in this Directive and other Union legislation, particularly those in
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, the Union and its Member States should make use of the latest scientific evidence
while implementing policies. Therefore, when the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change provides
scientific advice and issues reports regarding the EU ETS, the Commission should take such advice and reports into
account, in particular, as regards the need for additional Union policies and measures to ensure compliance with the
objectives and targets of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and additional Union policies and measures in view of the
ambition and environmental integrity of global market-based measures for aviation and maritime transport.
```
```
(96) To acknowledge the contribution of EU ETS revenues to the climate transition, an EU ETS label should be introduced.
Among other measures to ensure the visibility of funding from the EU ETS, Member States and the Commission
should ensure that projects and activities supported through the Modernisation Fund and the Innovation Fund are
clearly indicated as coming from EU ETS revenues by displaying an appropriate label.

28.2.2011, p. 13).

```
(97) With a view to achieving the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, a
Union-wide climate target for 2040 should be set, based on a legislative proposal to amend that Regulation. The EU
ETS should be reviewed to align it with the Union 2040 climate target. As a result, by July 2026 the Commission
should report on several aspects of the EU ETS to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanying the
report, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal and impact assessment. In line with Regulation
(EU) 2021/1119, priority should be given to direct emission reductions, which will have to be complemented by
increased carbon removals in order to achieve climate neutrality. Therefore, among other aspects, by July 2026 the
Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on how emissions removed from the
atmosphere and safely and permanently stored, for example through direct air capture, could potentially be covered
by emissions trading, without offsetting necessary emission reductions. Until all stages of the life of a product in
which captured carbon is used are subject to carbon pricing, in particular at the stage of waste incineration, reliance
on accounting for emissions at the point of their release from products into the atmosphere would result in
emissions being undercounted.
```
```
In order to regulate the capture of carbon in a way that reduces net emissions and ensures that all emissions are
accounted for and that double counting is avoided, while generating economic incentives, the Commission should
assess, by July 2026, whether all greenhouse gas emissions covered by Directive 2003/87/EC are effectively
accounted for, and whether double counting is effectively avoided. In particular, it should assess the accounting for
the greenhouse gas emissions which are considered to have been captured and utilised in a product in a way other
than that referred to in Article 12(3b), and take into account the downstream stages, including disposal and waste
incineration. Finally, the Commission should also report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
feasibility of lowering the 20 MW total rated thermal input thresholds for the activities in Annex I to
Directive 2003/87/EC, taking into account the environmental benefits and administrative burden.
```
```
(98) By July 2026, the Commission should also assess and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
feasibility of including municipal waste incineration installations in the EU ETS, including with a view to their
inclusion from 2028, and provide an assessment of the potential need for an option for a Member State to opt out
until the end of 2030, taking into account the importance of all sectors contributing to emission reductions.
Inclusion of municipal waste incineration installations in the EU ETS would contribute to the circular economy by
encouraging recycling, reuse and repair of products, while also contributing to economy-wide decarbonisation. The
inclusion of municipal waste incineration installations would reinforce incentives for sustainable management of
waste in line with the waste hierarchy and would create a level playing field between the regions that have included
municipal waste incineration under the scope of the EU ETS.
```
```
To avoid diversion of waste from municipal waste incineration installations towards landfills in the Union, which
create methane emissions, and to avoid exports of waste to third countries, with a potentially negative impact on
the environment, in its report the Commission should take into account the potential diversion of waste towards
disposal by landfilling in the Union and waste exports to third countries. The Commission should also take into
account the effects on the internal market, potential distortions of competition, environmental integrity, alignment
with the objectives of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(^31 )and robustness and
accuracy with respect to the monitoring and calculation of emissions. Considering the methane emissions from
landfilling and to avoid creating an uneven playing field, the Commission should also assess the possibility of
including other waste management processes, such as landfilling, fermentation, composting and mechanical-
biological treatment, in the EU ETS, when assessing the feasibility of including municipal waste incineration
installations.
```
```
(99) In order to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements
of a legislative act, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the
Commission in respect of the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning, the rules on the application of
conditionality, the rules on the operation of the Innovation Fund, the rules on the operation of the competitive
bidding mechanism in relation to CDs and CCDs, the requirements for considering that greenhouse gases have
become permanently chemically bound in a product and the extension of the activity referred to in Annex III to
Directive 2003/87/EC to other sectors. Moreover, to ensure synergies with the existing regulatory framework, the
delegation in Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC concerning the timing, administration and other aspects of
```
```
(^31 ) Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives
(OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/155


```
auctioning should be extended to cover the buildings, road transport and additional sectors. It is of particular
importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at
expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinsti­
tutional Agreement of 13 April 2016on Better Law-Making(^32 ). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the
preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as
Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups
dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
```
```
(100) The provisions relating to the existing EU ETS and its extension to maritime transport should apply from 2024 in
line with the need for urgent climate action and for all sectors to contribute to emission reductions in a cost-
effective manner. Consequently, Member States should transpose the provisions relating to those sectors by
31 December 2023. However, the deadline for transposing the provisions relating to the emissions trading system
for the buildings, road transport and additional sectors should be 30 June 2024 , as the rules on monitoring,
reporting, verification and permitting for those sectors apply from 1 January 2025, and require sufficient time for
orderly implementation. As an exception, to guarantee transparency and robust reporting, Member States should
transpose the obligation to report on historical emissions for those sectors by 31 December 2023 , as that
obligation relates to the emissions in the year 2024. In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of
28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents(^33 ), Member States have
undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more
documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of
national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such
documents to be justified.
```
```
(101) A well-functioning, reformed EU ETS comprising an instrument to stabilise the market is a key means for the Union
to achieve the economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030, the Union’s climate-neutrality
objective by 2050 at the latest, and the aim of achieving negative emissions thereafter as laid down in
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, as well as the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The market stability reserve seeks to
address the imbalance between supply and demand of allowances in the market. Article 3 of Decision
(EU) 2015/1814 provides that the reserve is to be reviewed three years after it becomes operational, paying
particular attention to the percentage figure for the determination of the number of allowances to be placed in the
market stability reserve, the threshold for the total number of allowances in circulation (TNAC) that determines the
intake of allowances, and the number of allowances to be released from the reserve. The current threshold
determining the placing of allowances in the market stability reserve was established in 2018, with the last review
of the EU ETS, while the linear reduction factor is being increased with this Directive. Therefore, as part of the
regular review of the functioning of the market stability reserve, the Commission should also assess the need for a
potential adjustment of that threshold, in line with the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(102) Considering the need to deliver a stronger investment signal to reduce emissions in a cost-efficient manner and with
a view to strengthening the EU ETS, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 should be amended so as to increase the percentage
rate for determining the number of allowances to be placed each year in the market stability reserve. In addition, for
lower levels of the TNAC, the intake should be equal to the difference between the TNAC and the threshold that
determines the intake of allowances. This would prevent the considerable uncertainty in the auction volumes that
results when the TNAC is close to the threshold, and at the same time ensure that the surplus reaches the volume
bandwidth within which the carbon market is deemed to operate in a balanced manner.
```
```
(103) Furthermore, in order to ensure that the level of allowances that remains in the market stability reserve after the
invalidation is predictable, the invalidation of allowances in the reserve should no longer depend on the auction
volumes of the previous year. The number of allowances in the reserve should, therefore, be fixed at a level of 400
million allowances, which corresponds to the lower threshold for the value of the TNAC.
```
```

```
L 130/156 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


```
(104) The analysis of the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for this Directive has also shown that net demand
from aviation should be included in the TNAC. In addition, since aviation allowances can be used in the same way as
general allowances, including aviation in the reserve would make it a more accurate, and thus a better, tool to ensure
the stability of the market. The calculation of the TNAC should include aviation emissions and allowances issued in
respect of aviation as of the year following the entry into force of this Directive.
```
```
(105) To clarify the calculation of the TNAC, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 should specify that only allowances issued and not
put in the market stability reserve are included in the supply of allowances. Moreover, the formula should no longer
subtract the number of allowances in the market stability reserve from the supply of allowances. This change would
have no material impact on the result of the calculation of the TNAC, including on the past calculations of the TNAC
or on the reserve.
```
```
(106) In order to mitigate the risk of supply and demand imbalances associated with the start of emissions trading for the
buildings, road transport and additional sectors, as well as to render it more resistant to market shocks, the rule-
based mechanism of the market stability reserve should be applied to those sectors. For that reserve to be
operational from the start of the system, it should be established with an initial endowment of 600 million
allowances for emissions trading in the buildings, road transport and additional sectors. The initial lower and upper
thresholds, which trigger the release or intake of allowances from the reserve, should be subject to a general review
clause. Other elements such as the publication of the TNAC or the quantity of allowances released or placed in the
reserve should follow the rules of the reserve for other sectors.
```
```
(107) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective
and economically efficient way in a manner commensurate with the economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission
reduction target for 2030 through an extended and amended Union wide market-based mechanism, cannot be
sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at
Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5
of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this
Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
```
```
(108) Directive 2003/87/EC and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Scope of application to maritime transport activities
```
1. The allocation of allowances and the application of surrender requirements in respect of maritime transport
activities shall apply in respect of fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships performing voyages departing
from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call outside the jurisdiction of a
Member State, fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port of call
outside the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, one
hundred percent (100 %) of emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port of call under the
jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, and one
hundred percent (100 %) of emissions from ships within a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
2. The Commission shall, by 31 December 2023 , by means of implementing acts establish a list of neighbouring
container transhipment ports and update that list by 31 December every two years thereafter.

```
Those implementing acts shall list a port as a neighbouring container transhipment port where the share of
transhipment of containers, measured in twenty-foot equivalent units, exceeds 65 % of the total container traffic of
that port during the most recent twelve-month period for which relevant data are available and where that port is
located outside the Union but less than 300 nautical miles from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State. For
the purposes of this paragraph, containers shall be considered to be transhipped when they are unloaded from a ship
```
L 130/160 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


```
to the port for the sole purpose of being loaded onto another ship. The list established by the Commission pursuant to
the first subparagraph shall not include ports located in a third country for which that third country effectively applies
measures equivalent to this Directive.
```
```
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 22a(2).
```
3. Articles 9, 9a and 10 shall apply to maritime transport activities in the same manner as they apply to other
activities covered by the EU ETS with the following exception with regard to the application of Article 10.

```
Until 31 December 2030 , a share of allowances shall be attributed to Member States with a ratio of shipping
companies that would have been under their responsibility pursuant to Article 3gf compared to their respective
population in 2020 and based on data available for the period from 2018 to 2020, above 15 shipping companies
per million inhabitants. The quantity of allowances shall correspond to 3,5 % of the additional quantity of allowances
due to the increase in the cap for maritime transport referred to in Article 9, third paragraph, in the relevant year. For
the years 2024 and 2025, the quantity of allowances shall in addition be multiplied by the percentages applicable to
the relevant year pursuant to Article 3gb, first paragraph, points (a) and (b). The revenue generated from the
auctioning of that share of allowances should be used for the purposes referred to in Article 10(3), first
subparagraph, point (g), with regard to the maritime sector, and points (f) and (i). 50 % of the quantity of allowances
shall be distributed among the relevant Member States based on the share of shipping companies under their
responsibility and the remainder distributed in equal shares between them.
```
```
Article 3gb
```
```
Phase-in of requirements for maritime transport
```
```
Shipping companies shall be liable to surrender allowances according to the following schedule:
```
```
(a) 40 % of verified emissions reported for 2024 that would be subject to surrender requirements in accordance with
Article 12;
```
```
(b)70 % of verified emissions reported for 2025 that would be subject to surrender requirements in accordance with
Article 12;
```
```
(c) 100 % of verified emissions reported for 2026 and each year thereafter in accordance with Article 12.
```
```
Where fewer allowances are surrendered compared to the verified emissions from maritime transport for the years
2024 and 2025, once the difference between verified emissions and allowances surrendered has been established in
respect of each year, an amount of allowances corresponding to that difference shall be cancelled rather than
auctioned pursuant to Article 10.
```
```
Article 3gc
```
```
Provisions for transfer of the costs of the EU ETS from the shipping company to another entity
```
```
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that when the ultimate responsibility for the purchase of
the fuel, or the operation of the ship, or both, is assumed by an entity other than the shipping company pursuant to
a contractual arrangement, the shipping company is entitled to reimbursement from that entity for the costs arising
from the surrender of allowances.
```
```
‘Operation of the ship’ for the purposes of this Article means determining the cargo carried or the route and the speed
of the ship. The shipping company shall remain the entity responsible for surrendering allowances as required under
Articles 3gb and 12 and for overall compliance with the provisions of national law transposing this Directive.
Member States shall ensure that shipping companies under their responsibility comply with the obligations to
surrender allowances under Articles 3gb and 12, notwithstanding the entitlement of such shipping companies to be
reimbursed by the commercial operators for the costs arising from the surrender.

```
```
Reporting and review
```
1. In the event of the adoption by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of a global market-based
measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, the Commission shall review this Directive in
light of that adopted measure.

```
To that end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council within 18 months
of the adoption of such a global market-based measure and before it becomes operational. In that report, the
Commission shall examine the global market-based measure as regards:
```
```
(a) its ambition in light of the objectives of the Paris Agreement;
```
```
(b)its overall environmental integrity, including in comparison with the provisions of this Directive covering
maritime transport; and
```
```
(c) any issue related to the coherence between the EU ETS and that measure.
```
```
Where appropriate, the Commission may accompany the report referred to in the second subparagraph of this
paragraph with a legislative proposal to amend this Directive in a manner that is consistent with the Union 2030
climate target and the climate-neutrality objective set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and with the aim of
preserving the environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action, in order to ensure coherence
between the implementation of the global market-based measure and the EU ETS, while avoiding any significant
double burden.
```
2. In the event that the IMO does not adopt by 2028 a global market-based measure to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from maritime transport in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and at least to a level
comparable to that resulting from the Union measures taken under this Directive, the Commission shall submit a
report to the European Parliament and to the Council in which it shall examine the need to apply the allocation of
allowances and surrender requirements in respect of more than fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships
performing voyages between a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State and a port of call outside the
jurisdiction of a Member State, in light of the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In that report, the Commission shall,
in particular, consider progress at IMO level and examine whether any third country has a market-based measure
equivalent to this Directive and assess the risk of an increase in evasive practices, including through a shift to other
modes of transport or a shift of port hubs to ports outside the Union.

```
Where appropriate, the report referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal to
amend this Directive.
```
3. The Commission shall monitor the implementation of this Chapter in relation to maritime transport, in
particular to detect evasive behaviour in order to prevent such behaviour at an early stage, including giving
consideration to outermost regions, and report biennially from 2024 on the implementation of this Chapter in
relation to maritime transport and possible trends regarding shipping companies seeking to evade the requirements
of this Directive. The Commission shall also monitor impacts regarding, inter alia, possible transport cost increases,
market distortions and changes in port traffic, such as port evasion and shifts of transhipment hubs, the overall
competitiveness of the maritime sector in the Member States, and in particular impacts on those shipping services
that constitute essential services of territorial continuity. If appropriate, the Commission shall propose measures to
ensure the effective implementation of this Chapter in relation to maritime transport, in particular measures to
address trends regarding shipping companies seeking to evade the requirements of this Directive.
4. No later than 30 September 2028, the Commission shall assess the appropriateness of extending the
application of Article 3ga(3), second subparagraph, beyond 31 December 2030 and, if appropriate, submit a
legislative proposal to that effect.
5. No later than 31 December 2026 , the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the
Council in which it shall examine the feasibility and economic, environmental and social impacts of the inclusion in
this Directive of emissions from ships, including offshore ships, below 5 000gross tonnage but not below 400 gross
tonnage, building, in particular, on the analysis accompanying the review of Regulation (EU) 2015/757 due by
31 December 2024.

16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/163


```
That report shall also consider the interlinkages between this Directive and Regulation (EU) 2015/757 and draw on
the experience gained from the application thereof. In that report, the Commission shall also examine how this
Directive can best account for the uptake of renewable and low-carbon maritime fuels on a lifecycle basis. If
appropriate, the report may be accompanied by legislative proposals.’;

allowances shall be increased by 78,4 million allowances for maritime transport. The linear factor shall be 4,3 %
from 2024 to 2027 and 4,4 % from 2028. The linear factor shall also apply to the allowances corresponding to the
average emissions from maritime transport reported in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/757 for 2018
and 2019 that are addressed in Article 3ga of this Directive. The Commission shall publish the Union-wide quantity
of allowances by 6 September 2023.
```
```
From 1 January 2026and 1 January 2027respectively, the quantity of allowances shall be increased to take into
account the coverage of greenhouse gas emissions other than CO 2 emissions from maritime transport activities and
the coverage of emissions of offshore ships, based on their emissions for the most recent year for which data are
available. Notwithstanding Article 10(1), the allowances resulting from that increase shall be made available to
support innovation in accordance with Article 10a(8).’;

(i) the following subparagraphs are inserted after the second subparagraph:
```
```
‘If an installation is covered by the obligation to conduct an energy audit or to implement a certified energy
management system under Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council (*) and if the recommendations of the audit report or of the certified energy management system are
not implemented, unless the pay-back time for the relevant investments exceeds three years or unless the costs
of those investments are disproportionate, then the amount of free allocation shall be reduced by 20 %. The
amount of free allocation shall not be reduced if an operator demonstrates that it has implemented other
measures which lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions equivalent to those recommended by the audit
report or by the certified energy management system for the installation concerned.
```

```
The Commission shall supplement this Directive by providing, in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this
paragraph and without prejudice to the rules applicable under Directive 2012/27/EU, for administratively
simple harmonised rules for the application of the third subparagraph of this paragraph that ensure that the
application of the conditionality does not jeopardise a level playing field, environmental integrity or equal
treatment between installations across the Union. Those harmonised rules shall in particular provide for
timelines, for criteria for the recognition of implemented energy efficiency measures as well as for alternative
measures reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using the procedure for national implementing measures in
accordance with Article 11(1) of this Directive.
```
```
In addition to the requirements set out in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, the reduction by 20 %
referred to in that subparagraph shall be applied where, by 1 May 2024, operators of installations whose
greenhouse gas emission levels are higher than the 80th percentile of emission levels for the relevant product
benchmarks have not established a climate-neutrality plan for each of those installations for its activities
covered by this Directive. That plan shall contain the elements specified in Article 10b(4) and be established
in accordance with the implementing acts provided for in that Article. Article 10b(4) shall be read as only
referring to the installation level. The achievement of the targets and milestones referred to in Article 10b(4),
third subparagraph, point (b), shall be verified in respect of the period until 31 December 2025 and in respect
of each period ending 31 December of each fifth year thereafter, in accordance with the verification and
accreditation procedures provided for in Article 15. No free allowances beyond 80 % shall be allocated if
achievement of the intermediate targets and milestones has not been verified in respect of the period until
the end of 2025 or in respect of the period from 2026 to 2030.
```
```
Allowances that are not allocated due to a reduction of free allocation in accordance with the third and fifth
subparagraphs of this paragraph shall be used to exempt installations from the adjustment in accordance
with paragraph 5 of this Article. Where any such allowances remain, 50 % of those allowances shall be made
available to support innovation in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article. The other 50 % of those
allowances shall be auctioned in accordance with Article 10(1) of this Directive and Member States should
use the respective revenues to address any residual risk of carbon leakage in the sectors covered by Annex I
to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, supporting the transition and promoting their decarbonisation in accordance
with State aid rules.
```
```
No free allocation shall be given to installations in sectors or subsectors to the extent they are covered by
other measures to address the risk of carbon leakage as established by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The
measures referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly.

definitions and system boundaries of existing product benchmarks, considering as guiding principles the
circular use-potential of materials and that the benchmarks should be independent of the feedstock and the
type of production process, where the production processes have the same purpose. The Commission shall

```
```
‘1a. Subject to the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, no free allocation shall be given in relation to the
production of goods listed in Annex I to that Regulation.
```
```
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, for the first years of application of Regulation
(EU) 2023/956, the production of goods listed in Annex I to that Regulation shall benefit from free allocation in
reduced amounts. A factor reducing the free allocation for the production of those goods shall be applied (CBAM
factor). The CBAM factor shall be equal to 100 % for the period between the entry into force of that Regulation
and the end of 2025 and, subject to the application of provisions referred to in Article 36(2), point (b), of that
Regulation, shall be equal to 97,5 % in 2026, 95 % in 2027, 90 % in 2028, 77,5 % in 2029, 51,5 % in 2030,
39 % in 2031, 26,5 % in 2032 and 14 % in 2033. From 2034, no CBAM factor shall apply.
```
```
The reduction of free allocation shall be calculated annually as the average share of the demand for free allocation
for the production of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 compared to the calculated total free
allocation demand for all installations, for the relevant period referred to in Article 11(1) of this Directive. The
CBAM factor shall be applied in this calculation.
```
```
Allowances resulting from the reduction of free allocation shall be made available to support innovation in
accordance with paragraph 8.
```
```
By 31 December 2024 and as part of its annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council pursuant to
Article 10(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall assess the carbon leakage risk for goods subject to CBAM
and produced in the Union for export to third countries which do not apply the EU ETS or a similar carbon
pricing mechanism. The report shall in particular assess the carbon leakage risk in sectors to which CBAM will
apply, in particular the role and accelerated uptake of hydrogen, and the developments as regards trade flows
and the embedded emissions of goods produced by those sectors on the global market. Where the report
concludes that there is a carbon leakage risk for goods produced in the Union for export to third countries which
do not apply the EU ETS or an equivalent carbon pricing mechanism, the Commission shall, where appropriate,
submit a legislative proposal to address that carbon leakage risk in a manner that is compliant with the rules of
the World Trade Organization, including Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and
takes into account the decarbonisation of installations in the Union.’;

(c) paragraph 2 is amended as follows:
```
```
(i) in the third subparagraph, point (c) is replaced by the following:
```
```
‘(c) For the period from 2026 to 2030, the benchmark values shall be determined in the same manner as set
out in points (a) and (d) of this subparagraph, taking into account point (e) of this subparagraph, on the
basis of information submitted pursuant to Article 11 for the years 2021 and 2022 and on the basis of
applying the annual reduction rate in respect of each year between 2008 and 2028.’;

(ii) in the third subparagraph, the following points are added:
```
```
‘(d) Where the annual reduction rate exceeds 2,5 % or is below 0,3 %, the benchmark values for the period
from 2026 to 2030 shall be the benchmark values applicable in the period from 2013 to 2020 reduced
by whichever of those two percentage rates is relevant, in respect of each year between 2008 and 2028.

allocations does not reach the maximum amount that respects the auctioning share, the remaining allowances
up to that amount shall be used to prevent or limit reduction of free allocations to respect the auctioning share
in later years. Where, nonetheless, the maximum amount is reached, free allocations shall be adjusted
accordingly. Any such adjustment shall be done in a uniform manner. However, installations whose greenhouse
gas emission levels are below the average of the 10 % most efficient installations in a sector or subsector in the
Union for the relevant benchmarks in a year when the adjustment applies shall be exempted from that
adjustment.’;

‘Member States should adopt financial measures in accordance with the second and fourth subparagraphs of this
paragraph in favour of sectors or subsectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to
significant indirect costs that are actually incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity
prices, provided that such financial measures are in accordance with State aid rules, and in particular do not cause
undue distortions of competition in the internal market. The financial measures adopted should not compensate
indirect costs covered by free allocation in accordance with the benchmarks established pursuant to paragraph 1
of this Article. Where a Member State spends an amount higher than the equivalent of 25 % of the auction
revenues referred to in Article 10(3) for the year in which the indirect costs were incurred, it shall set out the
reasons for exceeding that amount.’;

‘From 2021, allowances that, pursuant to paragraphs 19, 20 and 22, are not allocated to installations shall be
added to the amount of allowances set aside in accordance with the first subparagraph, first sentence, of this
paragraph.’;

(h) paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:
```
```
‘8. 345 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be allocated for free pursuant to this
Article, and 80 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be auctioned pursuant to Article 10,
as well as the allowances resulting from the reduction of free allocation referred to in paragraph 1a of this Article,
shall be made available to a fund (the ‘Innovation Fund’) with the objective of supporting innovation in low- and
zero-carbon techniques, processes and technologies that contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the
sectors covered by this Directive and contribute to zero pollution and circularity objectives, including projects
aimed at scaling up such techniques, processes and technologies with a view to their broad roll-out across the
Union. Such projects shall possess significant greenhouse gas emissions abatement potential and contribute to
energy and resource savings in line with the Union’s climate and energy targets for 2030.

The Innovation Fund shall cover the sectors listed in Annexes I and III, as well as products and processes
substituting carbon intensive ones produced or used in sectors listed in Annex I, including innovative renewable
energy and energy storage technologies and environmentally safe carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) that
contributes substantially to mitigating climate change, in particular for unavoidable process emissions, and shall
help stimulate the construction and operation of projects aimed at the environmentally safe capture, transport
and geological storage (CCS) of CO 2 , in particular for unavoidable industrial process emissions, and the direct

capture of CO 2 from the atmosphere with safe, sustainable and permanent storage (DACS), in geographically
balanced locations. The Innovation Fund may also support breakthrough innovative technologies and
infrastructure, including production of low- and zero-carbon fuels, to decarbonise the maritime, aviation, rail
and road transport sectors, including collective forms of transport such as public transport and coach services.
```
```
For aviation, it may also support electrification and actions to reduce the overall climate impacts of aviation.
```
```
The Commission shall give special attention to projects in sectors covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to
support innovation in low-carbon technologies, CCU, CCS, renewable energy and energy storage, in a way that
contributes to mitigating climate change with the aim of awarding, over the period from 2021 to 2030, projects
in those sectors a significant share of the equivalence in financial value of the allowances referred to in paragraph
1a, fourth subparagraph, of this Article. In addition, the Commission may launch, before 2027, calls for
proposals dedicated to the sectors covered by that Regulation.
```
```
The Commission shall also give special attention to projects contributing to the decarbonisation of the maritime
sector and shall include topics dedicated to that purpose in the Innovation Fund calls for proposals, where
appropriate, including to electrify maritime transport, and to address its full climate impact, including black
carbon emissions. Such calls for proposals shall also, in the criteria used for the selection of projects, take
particular account of the potential for increasing biodiversity protection and for reducing noise and water
pollution from projects and investments.
```
```
The Innovation Fund may in accordance with paragraph 8a support projects through competitive bidding, such
as CDs, CCDs or fixed premium contracts to support decarbonisation technologies for which the carbon price
might not be a sufficient incentive.
```
```
The Commission shall seek synergies between the Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe, in particular in relation
to European partnerships, and shall, where relevant, seek synergies between the Innovation Fund and other Union
programmes.
```
```
Projects in the territory of all Member States, including small-scale and medium-scale projects, shall be eligible,
and, for maritime activities, projects with clear added value for the Union shall be eligible. Technologies receiving
support shall be innovative and not yet commercially viable at a similar scale without support, but shall represent
breakthrough solutions or be sufficiently mature for application on a pre-commercial scale.
```
```
The Commission shall ensure that the allowances destined for the Innovation Fund are auctioned in accordance
with the principles and modalities referred to in Article 10(4) of this Directive. Proceeds from the auctioning
shall constitute external assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046
of the European Parliament and of the Council (**). Budgetary commitments for actions extending over more
than one financial year may be broken down into annual instalments over several years.
```
```
The Commission shall, on request, provide technical assistance to Member States with low effective participation
in projects under the Innovation Fund for the purpose of increasing the capacities of the requesting Member State
to support the efforts of project proponents in their respective territories to submit applications for funding from
the Innovation Fund, in order to improve the effective geographical participation in the Innovation Fund and
increase the overall quality of submitted projects. The Commission shall pursue effective, quality-based
geographical coverage in relation to funding from the Innovation Fund across the Union and shall ensure
comprehensive monitoring of progress and appropriate follow-up in that respect.
```
```
Subject to the agreement of applicants, following the closure of a call for proposals, the Commission shall inform
Member States of the applications for funding of projects in their respective territories and shall provide them
with detailed information concerning those applications in order to facilitate Member States’ coordination of the
support for projects. In addition, the Commission shall inform Member States about the list of pre-selected
projects prior to the award of the support.
```
```
Projects shall be selected by means of a transparent selection procedure, in a technology-neutral manner in
accordance with the objectives of the Innovation Fund as set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and
on the basis of objective and transparent criteria, taking into account the extent to which projects provide a
```

```
significant contribution to the Union’s climate and energy targets while contributing to the zero pollution and
circularity objectives in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph, and, where relevant, the extent
to which projects contribute to achieving emission reductions well below the benchmarks referred to in
paragraph 2. Projects shall have the potential for widespread application or to significantly lower the costs of
transitioning towards a climate-neutral economy in the sectors concerned. Priority shall be given to innovative
technologies and processes addressing multiple environmental impacts. Projects involving CCU shall deliver a
net reduction in emissions and ensure avoidance or permanent storage of CO 2. In the case of grants provided
through calls for proposals, up to 60 % of the relevant costs of projects may be supported, out of which up to
40 % need not be dependent on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, provided that pre-determined
milestones, taking into account the technology deployed, are attained. In the case of support provided through
competitive bidding and in the case of technical assistance support, up to 100 % of the relevant costs of projects
may be supported. The potential for emission reductions in multiple sectors offered by combined projects,
including in nearby areas, shall be taken into account in the criteria used for the selection of projects.

Projects funded by the Innovation Fund shall be required to share knowledge with other relevant projects as well
as with Union-based researchers having a legitimate interest. The terms of knowledge sharing shall be defined by
the Commission in calls for proposals.
```

On the basis of a qualitative and quantitative assessment by the Commission of the financial risks arising from the
implementation of CDs and CCDs, to be made after the conclusion of the first two rounds of the competitive
bidding mechanism and each time it is necessary thereafter in accordance with the principle of prudence,
whereby assets and profits are not to be overestimated and liabilities and losses are not to be underestimated, the
Commission may, in accordance with the empowerment in the eighth subparagraph, decide to cover only part of
the financial liability related to CDs and CCDs through the means referred to in the first subparagraph and the
remaining part through other means. The Commission shall aim to limit the use of other means of coverage.
```
```
Where the assessment leads to the conclusion that other means of coverage are necessary to realise the full
potential of the CDs and CCDs, the Commission shall aim for a balanced mix of other means of coverage. By
way of derogation from Article 210(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the Commission shall
determine the extent of the use of other means of coverage pursuant to the delegated act provided for in the
eighth subparagraph of this paragraph.

derogation from Article 209(2), points (d) and (h), Article 210(1), Article 211(1), (2), (4) and (6), Articles 212,
213 and 214, Article 218(1) and Article 219(3) and (6) of that Regulation. Where applicable, other means of
coverage, the provisioning rate and the necessary derogations shall be established in a delegated act provided for
in the eighth subparagraph of this paragraph.
```
```
The Commission shall not use more than 30 % of the proceeds of the auctioning of allowances allocated to the
Innovation Fund pursuant to paragraph 8 for provisioning for CDs and CCDs.
```
```
The provisioning rate shall be no lower than 50 % of the total financial liability borne by the Union budget for
CDs and CCDs. When establishing the provisioning rate, the Commission shall take into account elements that
may reduce the financial risks for the Union budget, beyond the appropriations available in the Innovation Fund,
such as possible sharing of liability with Member States on a voluntary basis, or a possible re-insurance
mechanism from the private sector. The Commission shall review the provisioning rate at least every three years
from the date of application of the delegated act establishing it for the first time.

In order to avoid speculative applications, access to competitive bidding may be made conditional on the
payment by applicants of a deposit to be forfeited in the event of non-fulfilment of the contract. Such forfeited
deposits shall be used for the Innovation Fund as external assigned revenue pursuant to Article 21(5) of
Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Any contribution paid to the granting authority by a beneficiary in
accordance with the terms of the CD or CCD where the reference price is higher than the strike price (‘reflows’)

stocktake agreed under the Paris Agreement, in particular with regard to the need for additional Union policies
and measures in view of necessary greenhouse gas reductions by the Union and its Member States, including in
relation to the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of this Directive. The Commission may, where appropriate,
submit legislative proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council to amend this Directive, in particular
in order to ensure compliance with the climate-neutrality objective laid down in Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2021/1119 and the Union climate targets laid down in Article 4 of that Regulation. When making its
legislative proposals, the Commission shall, to that end, consider, inter alia, the projected indicative Union
greenhouse gas budget for the period from 2030 to 2050 as referred to in Article 4(4) of that Regulation.’;

‘5. By 31 July 2026, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
following matters, accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal and impact assessment:
```
```
(a) how negative emissions resulting from greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere and safely
and permanently stored could be accounted for and how those negative emissions could be covered by
emissions trading, if appropriate, including a clear scope and strict criteria for such coverage, and safeguards
to ensure that such removals do not offset necessary emission reductions in accordance with Union climate
targets laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119;

emissions which are considered to have been captured and utilised in a product in a manner other than that
referred to in Article 12(3b).
```
6. When reviewing this Directive, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the Commission
shall analyse how linkages between the EU ETS and other carbon markets can be established without impeding
the achievement of the climate-neutrality objective and the Union climate targets laid down in Regulation
(EU) 2021/1119.
7. By 31 July 2026, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in
which it shall assess the feasibility of including municipal waste incineration installations in the EU ETS,
including with a view to their inclusion from 2028 and with an assessment of the potential need for an option
for a Member State to opt out until 31 December 2030. In that regard, the Commission shall take into account
the importance of all sectors contributing to emission reductions and potential diversion of waste towards
disposal by landfilling in the Union and waste exports to third countries. The Commission shall in addition take
into account relevant criteria such as the effects on the internal market, potential distortions of competition,
environmental integrity, alignment with the objectives of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council (*) and robustness and accuracy with regard to the monitoring and calculation of emissions. The
Commission shall, where appropriate and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Directive, accompany that
report with a legislative proposal to apply the provisions of this Chapter to greenhouse gas emissions permits
and the allocation and issue of additional allowances in respect of municipal waste incineration installations, and
to prevent potential diversion of waste.

```
In the report referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall also assess the possibility of including in
the EU ETS other waste management processes, in particular landfills which create methane and nitrous oxide
emissions in the Union. The Commission may, where appropriate, also accompany that report with a legislative
proposal to include such other waste management processes in the EU ETS.

Review of this Chapter
```
```
By 1 January 2028, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
implementation of the provisions of this Chapter with regard to their effectiveness, administration and practical
application, including on the application of the rules under Decision (EU) 2015/1814. Where appropriate, the
Commission shall accompany that report with a legislative proposal to amend this Chapter. By 31 October 2031 , the
Commission shall assess the feasibility of integrating the sectors covered by Annex III to this Directive into the EU ETS
covering the sectors listed in Annex I to this Directive.

Article 30j
```
```
Procedures for unilateral extension of the activity referred to in Annex III to other sectors not subject to
Chapters II and III
```
1. From 2027, Member States may extend the activity referred to in Annex III to sectors that are not listed in that
Annex and thereby apply emissions trading in accordance with this Chapter in such sectors, taking into account all
relevant criteria, in particular the effects on the internal market, potential distortions of competition, the
environmental integrity of the emissions trading system established pursuant to this Chapter and the reliability of the
planned monitoring and reporting system, provided that the extension of the activity referred to in that Annex is
approved by the Commission.

16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/189


```
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 to supplement this Directive
concerning the approval of an extension as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, authorisation for
the issue of additional allowances and authorisation of other Member States to extend the activity referred to in
Annex III. The Commission may also, when adopting such delegated acts, supplement the extension with further
rules governing measures to address possible instances of double counting, including for the issue of additional
allowances to compensate for allowances surrendered for use of fuels in activities listed in Annex I. Any financial
measures by Member States in favour of companies in sectors and subsectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of
carbon leakage, due to significant indirect costs that are incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in
fuel prices due to the unilateral extension, shall be in accordance with State aid rules, and shall not cause undue
distortions of competition in the internal market.
```
2. Additional allowances issued pursuant to an authorisation under this Article shall be auctioned in line with the
requirements laid down in Article 30d. Notwithstanding Article 30d(1) to (6), Member States having unilaterally
extended the activity referred to in Annex III in accordance with this Article shall determine the use of revenues
generated from the auctioning of those additional allowances.

whether one or both of the following conditions have been met:

```
(a) the average TTF gas price for the six calendar months ending 30 June 2026was higher than the average TTF gas
price in February and March 2022;
```
```
(b)the average Brent crude oil price for the six calendar months ending 30 June 2026was more than twice the
average Brent crude oil price during the five preceding years; the five-year reference period shall be the five-year
period that ends before the first month of the period of six calendar months.
```
2. Where one or both of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 are met, the following rules shall apply:

```
(a) by way of derogation from Article 30c(1), the first year for which the Union-wide quantity of allowances is
established shall be 2028 and, by way of derogation from Article 30c(3), the first year for which the Union-wide
quantity of allowances is adjusted shall be 2029;
```
```
(b)by way of derogation from Article 30d(1) and (2), the start of auctioning of allowances under this Chapter shall be
postponed to 2028;
```
```
(c) by way of derogation from Article 30d(2), the additional amount of allowances for the first year of auctions shall
be deducted from the auction volumes for the period from 2030 to 2032 and the initial holdings in the market
stability reserve shall be created in 2028;
```
```
(d)by way of derogation from Article 30e(2), the deadline for initial surrendering of allowances shall be put back to
31 May 2029for total emissions in the year 2028;

```
```
ANNEX IIIa
```
```
ADJUSTMENT OF LINEAR REDUCTION FACTOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 30c(2)
```
1. If the average emissions reported under Chapter IVa for the years 2024 to 2026 are more than 2 % higher
    compared to the value of the 2025 quantity defined in accordance with Article 30c(1), and if those differences
    are not due to the difference of less than 5 % between the emissions reported under Chapter IVa and the
    inventory data of 2025 Union greenhouse gas emissions from UNFCCC source categories for the sectors covered
    under Chapter IVa, the linear reduction factor shall be calculated by adjusting the linear reduction factor referred
    to in Article 30c(1).
2. The adjusted linear reduction factor in accordance with point 1 shall be determined as follows:
    LRFadj = 100%* [MRV[2024-2026] – (ESR[2024] - 6* LRF[ 2024 ]* ESR[2024])]/ (5* MRV[2024-2026]), where,
    LRFadj is the adjusted linear reduction factor;
    MRV[2024-2026] is the average of verified emissions under Chapter IVa for the years 2024 to 2026;
    ESR[2024] is the value of 2024 emissions defined in accordance with Article 30c(1) for the sectors covered under
    Chapter IVa;
    LRF[ 2024 ] is the linear reduction factor referred to in Article 30c(1).’;
(4) Annex IV to Directive 2003/87/EC is amended as follows:
(a) in Part A, the section ‘Calculation’ is amended as follows:
(i) in the third paragraph, the last sentence ‘The emission factor for biomass shall be zero.’ is replaced by the
following:
‘The emission factor for biomass that complies with the sustainability criteria and greenhouse gas emission-saving
criteria for the use of biomass established by Directive (EU) 2018/2001, with any necessary adjustments for
application under this Directive, as set out in the implementing acts referred to in Article 14 of this Directive, shall
be zero.’;
(ii) the fifth paragraph is replaced by the following:
‘Default oxidation factors developed pursuant to Directive 2010/75/EU shall be used, unless the operator can
demonstrate that activity-specific factors are more accurate.’;
(b)in Part B, section ‘Monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions’, fourth paragraph, the last sentence ‘The emission factor
for biomass shall be zero.’ is replaced by the following:
‘The emission factor for biomass that complies with the sustainability criteria and greenhouse gas emission-saving
criteria for the use of biomass established by Directive (EU) 2018/2001, with any necessary adjustments for
application under this Directive, as set out in the implementing acts referred to in Article 14 of this Directive, shall
be zero.’;

## ‘PART C

```
Monitoring and reporting of emissions corresponding to the activity referred to in Annex III
Monitoring of emissions
Emissions shall be monitored by calculation.
Calculation
Emissions shall be calculated using the following formula:
Fuel released for consumption × emission factor
Fuel released for consumption shall include the quantity of fuel released for consumption by the regulated entity.
Default IPCC emission factors, taken from the 2006 IPCC Inventory Guidelines or subsequent updates of those
Guidelines, shall be used unless fuel-specific emission factors identified by independent accredited laboratories
using accepted analytical methods are more accurate.
A separate calculation shall be made for each regulated entity, and for each fuel.
Reporting of emissions
Each regulated entity shall include the following information in its report:
A. Data identifying the regulated entity, including:
— name of the regulated entity;
— its address, including postcode and country;
— type of the fuels it releases for consumption and its activities through which it releases the fuels for
consumption, including the technology used;
— address, telephone, fax and email details for a contact person; and
— name of the owner of the regulated entity, and of any parent company.
B. For each type of fuel released for consumption and which is used for combustion in the sectors referred to in
Annex III, for which emissions are calculated:
— quantity of fuel released for consumption;
— emission factors;
— total emissions;
— end use(s) of the fuel released for consumption; and
— uncertainty.
```
```
Member States shall take measures to coordinate reporting requirements with any existing reporting
requirements in order to minimise the reporting burden on businesses.’;
(5) In Annex V to Directive 2003/87/EC, the following part is added:
```
## ‘PART C

```
Verification of emissions corresponding to the activity referred to in Annex III
General Principles
```
1. Emissions corresponding to the activity referred to in Annex III shall be subject to verification.
2. The verification process shall include consideration of the report pursuant to Article 14(3) and of monitoring
    during the preceding year. It shall address the reliability, credibility and accuracy of monitoring systems and the
    reported data and information relating to emissions, and in particular:
    (a) the reported fuels released for consumption and related calculations;

L 130/200 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


```
(b)the choice and the employment of emission factors;
(c) the calculations leading to the determination of the overall emissions.
```
3. Reported emissions may only be validated if reliable and credible data and information allow the emissions to be
    determined with a high degree of certainty. A high degree of certainty requires the regulated entity to show that:
    (a) the reported data are free of inconsistencies;
    (b)the collection of the data has been carried out in accordance with the applicable scientific standards; and
    (c) the relevant records of the regulated entity are complete and consistent.
4. The verifier shall be given access to all sites and information in relation to the subject of the verification.
5. The verifier shall take into account whether the regulated entity is registered under the Union eco-management
    and audit scheme (EMAS).
    Methodology
    Strategic analysis
6. The verification shall be based on a strategic analysis of all the quantities of fuels released for consumption by the
    regulated entity. This requires the verifier to have an overview of all the activities through which the regulated
    entity is releasing the fuels for consumption and their significance for emissions.
    Process analysis
7. The verification of the data and information submitted shall, where appropriate, be carried out on the site of the
    regulated entity. The verifier shall use spot-checks to determine the reliability of the reported data and information.
    Risk analysis
8. The verifier shall submit all the means through which the fuels are released for consumption by the regulated
    entity to an evaluation with regard to the reliability of the data on the overall emissions of the regulated entity.
9. On the basis of this analysis the verifier shall explicitly identify any element with a high risk of error and other
    aspects of the monitoring and reporting procedure which are likely to contribute to errors in the determination
    of the overall emissions. This especially involves the calculations necessary to determine the level of the emissions
    from individual sources. Particular attention shall be given to those elements with a high risk of error and the
    abovementioned aspects of the monitoring procedure.
10. The verifier shall take into consideration any effective risk control methods applied by the regulated entity with a
    view to minimising the degree of uncertainty.
    Report
11. The verifier shall prepare a report on the validation process stating whether the report pursuant to Article 14(3) is
    satisfactory. This report shall specify all issues relevant to the work carried out. A statement that the report
    pursuant to Article 14(3) is satisfactory may be made if, in the opinion of the verifier, the total emissions are not
    materially misstated.
    Minimum competency requirement for the verifier
12. The verifier shall be independent of the regulated entity, carry out his or her activities in a sound and objective
    professional manner, and understand:
    (a) the provisions of this Directive, as well as relevant standards and guidance adopted by the Commission
       pursuant to Article 14(1);

16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/201


```
(b)the legislative, regulatory, and administrative requirements relevant to the activities being verified; and
(c) the generation of all information related to all the means through which the fuels are released for consumption
by the regulated entity, in particular, relating to the collection, measurement, calculation and reporting of
data.’.
