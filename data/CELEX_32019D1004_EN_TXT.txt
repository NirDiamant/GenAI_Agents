# COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2019/1004

of 7 June 2019

laying down rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data on waste in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Implementing Decision C(2012) 2384 (notified under document C(2019) 4114) (Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,

Having regard to Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (1), and in particular Articles 11a(9) and 37(7) thereof,

# Whereas:

(1) Directive 2008/98/EC provides general calculation rules for the purpose of verifying whether the preparing for re-use and recycling targets for municipal waste for 2025, 2030 and 2035 laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) of that Directive have been attained.

(2) The rules set out in Article 11a of Directive 2008/98/EC specify that, as regards recycling, waste that enters a recycling operation or waste that has achieved end of waste status is to be used for the calculation of the targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035. As a general rule, the recycled waste is to be measured at the point where the waste enters the recycling operation. However, Member States may use a derogation and measure municipal waste at the output of a sorting operation, provided that further losses due to treatment prior to the recycling operation are deducted and that the output waste is actually recycled.

(3) Municipal waste entering the recycling operation may still contain a certain amount of waste materials that are not targeted by the subsequent reprocessing but could not with reasonable efforts be removed by preliminary operations prior to the recycling operation. Member States should not be required to deduct such non-targeted materials for the purposes of the calculation of recycled municipal waste, provided that the materials are tolerated in the recycling operation and do not impede high-quality recycling.

(4) In order to ensure uniform application of the calculation rules by all Member States, it is moreover necessary to establish, for the most common waste types and recycling processes, which waste materials should be included in the calculation in accordance with point (c) of Article 11a(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC (calculation points) and at which stage of the waste treatment they should be measured in accordance with Article 11a(2) of that Directive (measurement points).

(5) In order to ensure that the data to be reported on recycling of municipal waste are comparable, the calculation points established for the most common waste types and recycling processes should also apply to waste that has ceased to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before being reprocessed.

(6) In order to ensure comparability of data on recycling of municipal waste reported by waste facilities in different Member States, it is necessary to set out more detailed rules on how the amounts of sorted waste should be taken into account for calculating the input to the recycling operation, and how the amounts of recycled municipal waste should be calculated in cases where waste treatment results not only in recycled materials, but also in fuels or other means to generate energy or in backfilling materials.

(7) With regard to the calculation of bio-waste separated and recycled at source, the actual measurement of the input to or the output of the recycling operation is not always feasible since such waste is commonly managed by individual households. Therefore, a sound common approach that ensures a high level of reliability of the reported data should be established.

(8) With regard to recycled metals separated after incineration of municipal waste, in order to ensure that only recycled metals are taken into account, a calculation methodology should be set out that establishes the metal content of the waste materials that are separated from the incineration bottom ash. Moreover, in order to ensure the relevance of the data, only metals originating from the incineration of municipal waste should be taken into account.

(9) The data on preparing for re-use and recycling of municipal waste to be reported in accordance with Article 11a of Directive 2008/98/EC is to be underpinned by an effective system of quality control and traceability of waste material streams. Member States should therefore be required to take measures to ensure high reliability and accuracy of the data collected, in particular by collecting data directly from economic operators and by increasingly using electronic registries for recording data on waste.

(10) Member States are to report data to the Commission on the implementation of Article 11(2) and Article 11(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC for each calendar year. They are also to submit to the Commission a quality check report in the format for reporting established by the Commission. That format should ensure that the reported information provides a sufficient basis for verifying and monitoring the attainment of the targets set out in Article 11(2) and Article 11(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC.

(11) As regards the target laid down in point (a) of Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC, Member States have to apply the calculation rules laid down in Commission Decision 2011/753/EU (2). The calculation rules for the preparing for re-use and recycling of municipal waste laid down in Article 11a of Directive 2008/98/EC and in this Decision are consistent with those set out in Decision 2011/753/EU. In order to avoid double reporting, Member States should therefore have the possibility to use the reporting format established for the reporting of data on the targets laid down in points (c) to (e) of Article 11(2) and Article 11(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC to report data on the target laid down in point (a) of Article 11(2) of that Directive.

(12) Member States are to report data on mineral and synthetic lubrication and industrial oils and on waste oils in accordance with Article 37(4) of Directive 2008/98/EC for each calendar year in the format established by the Commission. That format should ensure that the data reported provide a sufficient basis for assessing the feasibility of adopting measures for the treatment of waste oils, including quantitative targets on the regeneration of waste oils and any further measures to promote the regeneration of waste oils, in accordance with Article 21(4) of Directive 2008/98/EC.

(13) For the purposes of reporting on the implementation of points (a) and (b) of Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC laying down targets for household and similar waste, and for construction and demolition waste, Member States are to use the formats established pursuant to Commission Implementing Decision C(2012) 2384 (3). The provisions of that Implementing Decision requiring Member States to submit triannual reports on the implementation of Directive 2008/98/EC have become obsolete. Therefore, Implementing Decision C(2012) 2384 should be repealed and replaced by the provisions set out in this Decision, which reflect the changes in the reporting requirements introduced in Directive 2008/98/EC by Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). In order to ensure continuity, transitional provisions should be adopted as regards the deadline for reporting the data concerning the implementation of points (a) and (b) of Article 11(2) for the reference years from 2016 to 2019.

(14) The rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data concerning the implementation of points (c) to (e) of Article 11(2) and Article 11(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC are closely linked to the rules setting out the formats for the reporting of those data and of the data concerning the implementation of point (a) of Article 11(2) of that Directive. In order to ensure coherence between those rules and facilitate the access to them, both sets of rules should be laid down in a single Decision. Furthermore, to facilitate access to the uniform formats to report other data on waste under Directive 2008/98/EC, in particular data on construction and demolition waste and on mineral and synthetic lubrication and industrial oils and waste oils, those formats should also be included in this Decision. The methodology to establish average loss rates for the waste materials removed from sorted waste by further preliminary treatment prior to recycling will be subject to a separate Commission Delegated Decision.

(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 39 of Directive 2008/98/EC,

(2) Commission Decision 2011/753/EU of 18 November 2011 establishing rules and calculation methods for verifying compliance with

(3) Commission Implementing Decision of 18 April 2012 establishing a questionnaire for Member States reports on the implementation of the targets set in Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 310, 25.11.2011, p. 11).

(4) Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste (C(2012) 2384 final). (OJ L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 109).

# ANNEX II

# METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING MUNICIPAL BIO-WASTE SEPARATED AND RECYCLED AT SOURCE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 4(3)

1. The amount of municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source shall be calculated by using the following formula:

mMBWRS = Σ nARUi × (mFi + mGi)

where:
- mMBWRS means the mass of municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source;
- nARUi means the number of active recycling units for the recycling of municipal bio-waste at source in subsample i;
- mFi means the mass of food and kitchen municipal bio-waste recycled at source per active recycling unit in subsample i; and
- mGi means the mass of garden and park municipal bio-waste recycled at source per active recycling unit in subsample i.
2. The number of active recycling units for the recycling of municipal bio-waste at source shall include only those recycling units that are used by waste producers. That number shall be retrieved from registers of such units or shall be obtained through surveys of households.
3. The amount of municipal bio-waste that is recycled at source per active recycling unit shall be determined through direct or indirect measurement of bio-waste entering active recycling units as specified in points 4 and 5.
4. Direct measurement requires measuring the input to the active recycling unit or its output under the following conditions:
- (a) the measurement shall be carried out, where feasible, by or on behalf of public authorities;
- (b) where the measurement is carried out by the waste producers themselves, Member States shall ensure that the reported amounts are subject to plausibility checks and are adjusted to the effect that the amount of bio-waste separated and recycled at source per person in no case exceeds the average amount per capita of municipal bio-waste collected by waste operators at national, regional or local level;
- (c) where the output of an active recycling unit is measured, a reliable coefficient shall be applied in order to calculate the amount of the input.
5. Indirect measurement requires measuring the following amounts through composition surveys of collected municipal waste, which take account of municipal bio-waste that is separately collected and of municipal bio-waste that is not separately collected:
- (a) the amount of bio-waste contained in collected municipal waste that is generated by households or in areas where waste is separated and recycled at source;
- (b) the amount of bio-waste contained in collected municipal waste that is generated by households or in areas with characteristics that are similar to the characteristics of households or areas referred to in point (a), where waste is not separated and recycled at source.

The amount of municipal bio-waste that is separated and recycled at source shall be determined based on the difference between the amounts specified in points (a) and (b).
6. The methodology to determine the amount of municipal bio-waste that is separated and recycled at source per active recycling unit pursuant to points 3 to 5, in particular the sampling methods used in surveys to collect data, shall reflect at least the following factors:
- (a) the size and type of households that use an active recycling unit in the case of food and kitchen waste;
- (b) the size and management of gardens and parks served by an active recycling unit in the case of garden and park waste;
---
# Official Journal of the European Union

# 20.6.2019

# L 163/73

(c) the available collection system, in particular the complementary use of waste collection services for bio-waste and mixed municipal waste;

(d) the level and seasonality of municipal bio-waste generation.

# 7.

Where the share of municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source in all municipal waste generated is less than 5 % at national level, Member States may use a simplified methodology to calculate municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source by applying the following formula:

mMBWRS = nP × mBWpp × qRS

where:

- mMBWRS means the mass of municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source;
- nP means the number of persons involved in municipal bio-waste recycling at source;
- mBWpp means the mass of generated municipal bio-waste per capita; and
- qRS means a coefficient representing the share of municipal bio-waste generated that is likely to be separated and recycled at source in the total amount of municipal bio-waste generated.

# 8.

For the purposes of applying the formula laid down in point 7 Member States shall ensure that:

- mBWpp is calculated on the basis of surveys on the composition of separately collected and mixed municipal waste at national, regional or local level as appropriate;
- qRS is determined by taking into account the factors listed in points (a) to (d) of point 6.

# 9.

The formulas laid down in this Annex may be applied to all municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source or only to food and kitchen municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source.

# 10.

The surveys to collect data for the purposes of applying the formulas laid down in this Annex shall be carried out for the first year of reporting on municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source and thereafter at least every five years, and for other years whenever there are reasons to expect significant changes in the amount of municipal bio-waste separated and recycled at source.

Member States may update the reported amount of municipal waste recycled at source for the years for which data is not collected by using appropriate estimates.

# 11.

The surveys to collect data for the purposes of applying the formulas laid down in this Annex shall be based on representative samples and appropriate sub-samples. The results of those surveys shall be statistically significant according to scientifically accepted statistical techniques.

# 12.

Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the reported amounts of municipal bio-waste that is separated and recycled at source are not overestimated.

# ANNEX III

# METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING RECYCLED METALS SEPARATED AFTER INCINERATION OF MUNICIPAL WASTE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 5(2)

# 1.

The following definitions shall apply in relation to the formulas set out in this Annex:

- mtotal IBA metals means total mass of metals in incineration bottom ash in a given year;
- mIBA metal concentrates means mass of metal concentrates separated from raw municipal waste incineration bottom ash in a given year;
- cIBA metals means concentration of metals in metal concentrates;
- mIBA metals means mass of metals in the metal concentrate in a given year;
- mnon-metallic means mass of non-metallic material in metal concentrate in a given year;
- mMSW means mass of municipal waste entering an incineration operation in a given year;
- cmetals MSW means concentration of metals in municipal waste entering an incineration operation;
- mW means mass of all waste entering an incineration operation in a given year;
- cmetals MSWI means concentration of metals in all waste entering an incineration operation;
- mMSW IBA metals means mass of metals originating from municipal waste in a given year.

# 2.

Following the separation of metal concentrate from raw incineration bottom ash, the total mass of metals in incineration bottom ash in a given year shall be calculated by applying the following formula:

mtotal IBA metals = (mIBA metal concentrates × cIBA metals)

# 3.

Data on the mass of metal concentrates shall be obtained from facilities that separate metal concentrates from raw incineration bottom ash.

# 4.

The concentration of metals in metal concentrates shall be calculated by using data collected by regular surveys from facilities that treat metal concentrates and deliver their output to facilities producing metal products. Distinction shall be made between ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and stainless steel. The following formula shall be applied in order to calculate the concentration of metals in metal concentrates:

cIBA metals = mIBA metal concentrates / mIBA metals = (mIBA metal concentrates − mnon-metallic) / mIBA metal concentrates

# 5.

Where municipal waste is incinerated together with other waste, the concentration of metals in the incinerated waste from various sources shall be determined through a sampling survey of the waste that enters the incineration operation. This survey shall be carried out at least every five years and whenever there are reasons to expect that the composition of the waste has significantly changed. The mass of metals originating from municipal waste shall be calculated by applying the following formula:

mMSW IBA metals = mMSW × cmetals MSW + mW × cmetals MSWI − mtotal IBA metals

# 6.

By way of derogation from point 5, where the share of municipal waste in all incinerated waste is above 75 %, the mass of metals originating from municipal waste may be calculated by applying the following formula:

mMSW IBA metals = mMSW × mtotal IBA metals / mW
