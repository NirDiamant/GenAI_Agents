THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
```
```
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
```
```
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
```
```
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
```
```
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(^1 ),
```
```
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(^2 ),
```
```
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(^3 ),
```
```
Whereas:
```
```
(1) In its communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’), the
Commission set out a new growth strategy. That strategy aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous
society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, where there are no net emissions (emissions
after deduction of removals) of greenhouse gases (‘greenhouse gas emissions’) at the latest by 2050 and where
economic growth is decoupled from the use of resources. The European Green Deal aims to protect, conserve and
enhance the Union’s natural capital, and to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related
risks and impacts. At the same time, that transformation must be just and inclusive, leaving no one behind. The
Commission also announced in its communication of 12 May 2021entitled ‘Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All,
EU Action Plan: Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’ the promotion of relevant instruments and
incentives to better implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle set out in Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and thus complete the phasing out of ‘pollution for free’ with a view to
maximising synergies between decarbonisation and the zero-pollution ambition.
```
```
(2) The Paris Agreement(^4 ), adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the ‘Paris Agreement’), entered into force on 4 November 2016. The Parties to the Paris
Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial
levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Under the
Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted on 13 November 2021 , the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, serving as the
meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, also recognised that limiting the increase in the global average
temperature to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change,
and committed to strengthening the 2030 targets by the end of 2022 to close the ambition gap.

(3) Tackling climate and other environment-related challenges and reaching the objectives of the Paris Agreement are at
the core of the European Green Deal. The value of the European Green Deal has only grown in light of the very
severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and economic well-being of the Union’s citizens.
```
```
(4) The Union committed to reducing the Union’s economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 %
compared to 1990 levels by 2030, as set out in the submission to the UNFCCC on behalf of the European Union
and its Member States on the update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and its
Member States.
```
```
(5) Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^5 )has enshrined in legislation the
objective of economy-wide climate neutrality at the latest by 2050. That Regulation also establishes a binding
Union domestic reduction target for net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) of at
least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030.
```
```
(6) The Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of 2018 on the impacts of global
temperature increases of 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways
provides a strong scientific basis for tackling climate change and illustrates the need to step up climate action. That
report confirms that, in order to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events, greenhouse gas emissions need to
be urgently reduced, and that climate change needs to be limited to a global temperature increase of 1,5 °C.
Moreover, if mitigation pathways, consistent with limiting global warming to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels, are
not rapidly activated, much more expensive and complex adaptation measures will have to be taken to avoid the
impacts of higher levels of global warming. The contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of
the IPCC entitled ‘Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’ recalls that climate change is already affecting
every region on Earth and projects that in the coming decades climate change will increase in all regions. That
report stresses that, unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,
limiting warming to close to 1,5 °C or even 2 °C will be beyond reach.
```
```
(7) The Union has been pursuing an ambitious policy on climate action and has put in place a regulatory framework to
achieve its 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The legislation implementing that target consists,
inter alia, of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(^6 ), which establishes a system for
greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (‘EU ETS’) and delivers harmonised pricing of
greenhouse gas emissions at Union level for energy-intensive sectors and subsectors, of Regulation (EU) 2018/
of the European Parliament and of the Council(^7 ), which introduces national targets for the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the
Council(^8 ), which requires Member States to compensate greenhouse gas emissions from land use with the removal
of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
```
```
(8) While the Union has substantially reduced its domestic greenhouse gas emissions, the greenhouse gas emissions
embedded in imports to the Union have been increasing, thereby undermining the Union’s efforts to reduce its
global greenhouse gas emissions footprint. The Union has a responsibility to continue playing a leading role in
global climate action.

(9) As long as a significant number of the Union’s international partners have policy approaches that do not achieve the
same level of climate ambition, there is a risk of carbon leakage. Carbon leakage occurs if, for reasons of costs related
to climate policies, businesses in certain industry sectors or subsectors transfer production to other countries or
imports from those countries replace equivalent products that are less intensive in terms of greenhouse
gas emissions. Such situations could lead to an increase in the total global emissions, thus jeopardising the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that is urgently needed if the world is to keep the increase in global average
temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to
1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. As the Union increases its climate ambition, that risk of carbon leakage could
undermine the effectiveness of Union emission reduction policies.
```
```
(10) The initiative for a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) is part of the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package.
The CBAM is to serve as an essential element of the Union’s toolbox for meeting the objective of a climate-neutral
Union at the latest by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement by addressing the risk of carbon leakage that results
from the Union’s increased climate ambition. The CBAM is expected to also contribute to promoting
decarbonisation in third countries.
```
```
(11) Existing mechanisms for addressing the risk of carbon leakage in sectors or subsectors where such risk exists consist
of the transitional free allocation of EU ETS allowances and financial measures to compensate for indirect emission
costs incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices. Those mechanisms are set out in
Article 10a(6) and Article 10b of Directive 2003/87/EC, respectively. The free allocation of EU ETS allowances at
the level of best performers has been a policy instrument for certain industrial sectors to address the risk of carbon
leakage. However, compared to full auctioning, such free allocation weakens the price signal that the system
provides and thus affects the incentives for investment into further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
```
```
(12) The CBAM seeks to replace those existing mechanisms by addressing the risk of carbon leakage in a different way,
namely by ensuring equivalent carbon pricing for imports and domestic products. To ensure a gradual transition
from the current system of free allowances to the CBAM, the CBAM should be progressively phased in while free
allowances in sectors covered by the CBAM are phased out. The combined and transitional application of EU ETS
allowances allocated free of charge and of the CBAM should in no case result in more favourable treatment for
Union goods compared to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union.
```
```
(13) The carbon price is rising, and companies need long-term visibility, predictability and legal certainty to make their
decisions on investment in the decarbonisation of industrial processes. Therefore, in order to strengthen the legal
framework for fighting carbon leakage, a clear pathway for gradual further extension of the scope of the CBAM to
products, sectors and subsectors at risk of carbon leakage should be established.
```
```
(14) While the objective of the CBAM is to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, this Regulation would also encourage
producers from third countries to use technologies that are more efficient in reducing greenhouse gases so that
fewer emissions are generated. For that reason, the CBAM is expected to effectively support the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions in third countries.
```
```
(15) As an instrument to prevent carbon leakage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the CBAM should ensure that
imported products are subject to a regulatory system that applies carbon costs equivalent to those borne under the
EU ETS, resulting in a carbon price that is equivalent for imports and domestic products. The CBAM is a climate
measure which should support the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the risk of carbon
leakage, while ensuring compatibility with World Trade Organization law.
```
L 130/54 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
(16) This Regulation should apply to goods imported into the customs territory of the Union from third countries, except
where their production has already been subject to the EU ETS through its application to third countries or
territories or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.
```
```
(17) With a view to ensuring that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is continuously accompanied by economic
and social cohesion, account should be taken, upon future revision of this Regulation, of the special characteristics
and constraints of the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU as well as of island States which are part of
the customs territory of the Union, without undermining the integrity and coherence of the Union legal order,
including the internal market and common policies.
```
```
(18) With a view to preventing the risk of carbon leakage in offshore installations, this Regulation should apply to goods,
or processed products from those goods resulting from an inward processing procedure, that are brought to an
artificial island, a fixed or floating structure, or any other structure on the continental shelf or in the exclusive
economic zone of a Member State where that continental shelf or exclusive economic zone is adjacent to the
customs territory of the Union. Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down detailed
conditions for the application of the CBAM to such goods.
```
```
(19) The greenhouse gas emissions that should be subject to the CBAM should correspond to those greenhouse gas
emissions covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, namely carbon dioxide (‘CO 2 ’) as well as, where relevant,
nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. The CBAM should initially apply to direct emissions of those greenhouse gases
from the time of production of goods until the import of those goods into the customs territory of the Union,
mirroring the scope of the EU ETS to ensure coherence. The CBAM should also apply to indirect emissions. Those
indirect emissions are the emissions arising from the generation of electricity used to produce the goods to which
this Regulation applies. The inclusion of indirect emissions would further enhance the environmental effectiveness
of the CBAM and its ambition to contribute to fighting climate change. Indirect emissions should, however, not be
taken into account initially for the goods in respect of which financial measures apply in the Union that compensate
for indirect emissions costs incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices. Those goods
are identified in Annex II to this Regulation. Future revisions of the EU ETS in Directive 2003/87/EC and, in
particular, revisions of the compensation measures of the indirect costs should be appropriately reflected as regards
the scope of application of the CBAM. During the transitional period, data should be collected for the purpose of
further specifying the methodology for the calculation of indirect emissions. That methodology should take into
account the quantity of electricity used for the production of the goods listed in Annex I to this Regulation, as well
as the country of origin, generation source, and the emission factors related to that electricity. The specific
methodology should be further specified in order to achieve the most appropriate way to prevent carbon leakage
and ensure the environmental integrity of the CBAM.
```
```
(20) The EU ETS and the CBAM share a common objective of pricing greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the same
sectors and goods through the use of specific allowances or certificates. Both systems have a regulatory nature and
are justified by the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the binding environmental target under
Union law, set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, to reduce the Union’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least
55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and the objective to reach economy-wide climate neutrality at the latest by
2050.
```
```
(21) While the EU ETS sets the total number of allowances issued (the ‘cap’) on the greenhouse gas emissions from
activities within its scope and allows trading of allowances (the ‘cap and trade system’), the CBAM should not
establish quantitative limits on imports, so that trade flows are not restricted. Moreover, while the EU ETS applies to
installations in the Union, the CBAM should apply to certain goods imported into the customs territory of the
Union.
```
```
(22) The CBAM system has some specific features when compared to the EU ETS, including with respect to the
calculation of the price of CBAM certificates, the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and their period of validity.
Those features are due to the need to preserve the effectiveness of the CBAM as a measure to prevent carbon leakage
over time. They also ensure that the management of the CBAM system is not excessively burdensome, both in terms
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/


```
of obligations imposed on operators and administrative resources, while at the same time preserving a level of
flexibility available to operators equivalent to that under the EU ETS. Ensuring such a balance is of particular
importance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) concerned.
```
```
(23) In order to preserve its effectiveness as a measure to prevent carbon leakage, the CBAM needs to reflect closely the
EU ETS price. While on the EU ETS market the price of allowances released onto the market is determined through
auctions, the price of CBAM certificates should reasonably reflect the price of such auctions through averages
calculated on a weekly basis. Such weekly average prices reflect closely the price fluctuations of the EU ETS and
allow a reasonable margin for importers to take advantage of the price changes of the EU ETS while also ensuring
that the system remains manageable for administrative authorities.
```
```
(24) Under the EU ETS, the cap determines the supply of emission allowances and provides certainty about maximum
emissions of greenhouse gases. The carbon price is determined by the balance of that supply against the market
demand. Scarcity is necessary for there to be a price incentive. This Regulation is not intended to impose a cap on
the number of CBAM certificates available to importers; if importers were able to carry forward and trade CBAM
certificates, that ability could have resulted in situations where the price for CBAM certificates would no longer
reflect the evolution of the price in the EU ETS. Such a situation would weaken the incentive for decarbonisation,
favouring carbon leakage and impairing the overarching climate objective of the CBAM. It could also result in
different prices for operators from different countries. The limits on the possibilities to trade CBAM certificates and
to carry them forward are therefore justified by the need to avoid undermining the effectiveness and climate
objective of the CBAM and to ensure even-handed treatment of operators from different countries. However, in
order to preserve the possibility for importers to optimise their costs, this Regulation should provide for a system
where authorities can repurchase a certain amount of excess certificates from importers. Such amount should be set
at a level which allows a reasonable margin for importers to leverage their costs over the period of validity of the
certificates while preserving the overall price transmission effect, ensuring that the environmental objective of the
CBAM is preserved.
```
```
(25) Given that the CBAM would apply to imports of goods into the customs territory of the Union rather than to
installations, certain adaptations and simplifications would also need to apply in the CBAM. One such
simplification should be the introduction of a simple and accessible declarative system whereby importers report
the total verified greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods imported in a given calendar year. A different timing
compared to the compliance cycle of the EU ETS should also be applied to avoid any potential bottleneck that might
result from obligations for accredited verifiers under this Regulation and Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(26) Member States should impose penalties for infringements of this Regulation and ensure that such penalties are
enforced. More specifically, the penalty amount for the failure of an authorised CBAM declarant to surrender CBAM
certificates should be identical to the amount pursuant to Article 16(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. However,
where the goods have been introduced into the Union by a person other than an authorised CBAM declarant
without complying with the obligations under this Regulation, the amount of those penalties should be higher in
order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, also taking into account the fact that such person is not obliged
to surrender CBAM certificates. The imposition of penalties under this Regulation is without prejudice to penalties
that may be imposed under Union or national law for the infringement of other relevant obligations, in particular
those related to customs rules.
```
```
(27) While the EU ETS applies to certain production processes and activities, the CBAM should target the corresponding
imports of goods. That requires clearly identifying imported goods by means of their classification in the Combined
Nomenclature (‘CN’) set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87(^9 )and linking them to embedded emissions.
```
```
(^9 ) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff
(OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p. 1).
```
L 130/56 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
(28) The goods or processed products covered by the CBAM should reflect the activities covered by the EU ETS as that
system is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria linked to the environmental objective of
Directive 2003/87/EC and is the most comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions regulatory system in the Union.
```
```
(29) Defining the scope of the CBAM in a way that reflects the activities covered by the EU ETS would also contribute to
ensuring that imported products are granted a treatment that is not less favourable than that accorded to like
products of domestic origin.
```
```
(30) Whilst the ultimate objective of the CBAM is one of broad product coverage, it would be prudent to start with a
selected number of sectors with relatively homogeneous goods where there is a risk of carbon leakage. Union
sectors deemed to be at risk of carbon leakage are listed in Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708(^10 ).
```
```
(31) The goods, to which this Regulation should apply, should be selected after careful analysis of their relevance in terms
of cumulated greenhouse gas emissions and risk of carbon leakage in the corresponding EU ETS sectors, while
limiting complexity and administrative burden on the operators concerned. In particular, the selection should take
into account basic materials and basic products covered by the EU ETS with the objective of ensuring that emissions
embedded in emission-intensive products imported into the Union are subject to a carbon price that is equivalent to
that applied to Union products, and of mitigating the risk of carbon leakage. The relevant criteria to narrow the
selection should be: first, relevance of sectors in terms of emissions, namely whether the sector is one of the largest
aggregate emitters of greenhouse gas emissions; second, the sector’s exposure to significant risk of carbon leakage,
as defined pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC; and third, the need to balance broad product coverage in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions, while limiting complexity and administrative burden.
```
```
(32) The use of the first criterion would allow the listing of the following industrial sectors in terms of cumulated
emissions: iron and steel, refineries, cement, aluminium, organic basic chemicals, hydrogen and fertilisers.
```
```
(33) Certain sectors listed in Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708 should not, however, be addressed in this Regulation at
this stage, due to their particular characteristics.
```
```
(34) In particular, organic chemicals should not be included in the scope of this Regulation due to technical limitations
that at the time of the adoption of this Regulation do not allow to define clearly the embedded emissions of such
imported goods. For those goods the applicable benchmark under the EU ETS is a basic parameter, which does not
allow for an unambiguous allocation of emissions embedded in individual imported goods. A more targeted
allocation to organic chemicals requires more data and analysis.
```
```
(35) Similar technical constraints apply to refinery products, for which it is not possible to unambiguously assign
greenhouse gas emissions to individual output products. At the same time, the relevant benchmark in the EU ETS
does not directly relate to specific products, such as petrol, diesel or kerosene, but to all refinery output.
```
```
(36) Aluminium products should be included in the CBAM as they are highly exposed to carbon leakage. Moreover, in
several industrial applications they are in direct competition with steel products because of characteristics which
closely resemble those of steel products.
```
```
(37) At the time of the adoption of this Regulation, imports of hydrogen into the Union are relatively low. However, that
situation is expected to change significantly in the coming years as the Union’s ‘Fit for 55’ package promotes the use
of renewable hydrogen. For the decarbonisation of industry as a whole, the demand for renewable hydrogen will
increase, and consequently lead to non-integrated production processes in downstream products where hydrogen is
a precursor. The inclusion of hydrogen in the scope of the CBAM is the appropriate means to further foster the
decarbonisation of hydrogen.
```
```
(^10 ) Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/708 of 15 February 2019 supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council concerning the determination of sectors and subsectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage for the period
2021 to 2030 (OJ L 120, 8.5.2019, p. 20).
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/


```
(38) Similarly, certain products should be included in the scope of the CBAM despite their low level of embedded
emissions occurring during their production process, as their exclusion would increase the likelihood of
circumventing the inclusion of steel products in the CBAM by modifying the pattern of trade towards downstream
products.
```
```
(39) Conversely, this Regulation should not initially apply to certain products the production of which does not entail
meaningful emissions such as ferrous scrap, some ferro-alloys and certain fertilisers.
```
```
(40) The importation of electricity should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as that sector is responsible for
30 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. The Union’s increased climate ambition would widen the
gap in carbon costs between electricity production within the Union and third countries. That gap, combined with
the progress in connecting the Union electricity grid to that of its neighbours, would increase the risk of carbon
leakage due to the increase in imports of electricity, a significant part of which is produced by coal-fired power
plants.
```
```
(41) In order to avoid excessive administrative burden as regards competent national administrations and importers, it is
appropriate to specify the limited cases in which the obligations under this Regulation should not apply. That de
minimis provision, however, is without prejudice to a continued application of the provisions under Union or
national law that are necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation as well as, in
particular, with customs legislation, including the prevention of fraud.
```
```
(42) As importers of goods covered by this Regulation should not have to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation at
the time of importation, specific administrative measures should be applied to ensure that such obligations are
fulfilled at a later stage. Therefore, importers should only be entitled to import goods that are subject to this
Regulation after they have been granted an authorisation by competent authorities.
```
```
(43) The customs authorities should not allow the importation of goods by any person other than an authorised CBAM
declarant. In accordance with Articles 46 and 48 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and
of the Council(^11 ), the customs authorities are entitled to carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to
the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin
of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks
relating to the CBAM in the establishment of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of
Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.
```
```
(44) During a transitional period, the customs authorities should inform customs declarants of the obligation to report
information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to awareness on the need to request the
status of authorised CBAM declarants where applicable. Such information should be communicated by the customs
authorities in an appropriate manner to ensure that customs declarants are made aware of such obligation.
```
```
(45) The CBAM should be based on a declarative system in which an authorised CBAM declarant, who could represent
more than one importer, would submit annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported
into the customs territory of the Union and would surrender the number of CBAM certificates which correspond to
those declared emissions. The first CBAM declaration, in respect of the calendar year 2026, should be submitted by
31 May 2027.
```
```
(46) An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be
surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared
embedded emissions.
```
```
(^11 ) Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs
Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).
```
L 130/58 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


```
(47) The declared embedded emissions should be verified by a person accredited by a national accreditation body
appointed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(^12 )or
pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067(^13 ).
```
```
(48) The CBAM should allow operators of production installations in third countries to register in the CBAM registry and
to make their verified embedded emissions from production of goods available to authorised CBAM declarants. An
operator should be able to choose that its name, address and contact information in the CBAM registry are not
made accessible to the public.
```
```
(49) CBAM certificates would differ from EU ETS allowances for which daily auctioning is an essential feature. The need
to set a clear price for CBAM certificates would make daily publication excessively burdensome and confusing for
operators, as daily prices risk becoming obsolete upon publication. Thus, the publication of CBAM prices on a
weekly basis would more accurately reflect the pricing trend of EU ETS allowances released onto the market and
pursue the same climate objective. The calculation of the price of CBAM certificates should therefore be set on the
basis of a longer timeframe, namely on a weekly basis, than on the timeframe established by the EU ETS, namely on
a daily basis. The Commission should be tasked with calculating and publishing that average price.
```
```
(50) In order to give authorised CBAM declarants flexibility in complying with their obligations under this Regulation
and allow them to benefit from fluctuations in the price of EU ETS allowances, CBAM certificates should be valid
for a limited period of time from the date of their purchase. The authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to
re-sell a portion of the certificates bought in excess. With a view to surrendering CBAM certificates, the authorised
CBAM declarant should accumulate the number of certificates required during the year which corresponds with the
thresholds set at the end of each quarter.
```
```
(51) The physical characteristics of electricity as a product justify a slightly different design within the CBAM as compared
to other goods. Default values should be used under clearly specified conditions, and it should be possible for
authorised CBAM declarants to claim the calculation of their obligations under this Regulation based on actual
emissions. Electricity trade is different from trade in other goods, in particular because it is traded through
interconnected electricity grids, using power exchanges and specific forms of trading. Market coupling is a densely
regulated form of electricity trade which enables the aggregation of bids and offers across the Union.
```
```
(52) To avoid the risk of circumvention and improve the traceability of actual CO 2 emissions from import of electricity
and its use in goods, the calculation of actual emissions should only be permitted under certain strict conditions. In
particular, it should be necessary to demonstrate a firm nomination of the allocated interconnection capacity and
that there is a direct contractual relation between the purchaser and the producer of the renewable electricity, or
between the purchaser and the producer of electricity having lower than default value emissions.
```
```
(53) To reduce the risk of carbon leakage, the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention. The
Commission should evaluate the risk of such circumvention in all sectors to which this Regulation applies.
```
```
(54) Contracting Parties to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community concluded by Council
Decision 2006/500/EC(^14 )and, Parties to Association Agreements, including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade
Areas, are committed to decarbonisation processes that should eventually result in the adoption of carbon pricing
mechanisms similar or equivalent to the EU ETS or in their participation in the EU ETS.

(55) The integration of third countries into the Union electricity market is an important factor for those countries to
accelerate their transition to energy systems with high shares of renewable energies. Market coupling for electricity,
as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222(^15 ), enables third countries to better integrate electricity from
renewable energies into the electricity market, to exchange such electricity in an efficient manner within a wider area,
balancing supply and demand with the larger Union market, and to reduce the CO 2 emission intensity of their
electricity generation. Integration of third countries into the Union electricity market also contributes to the
security of electricity supplies in those countries and in the neighbouring Member States.
```
```
(56) Once the electricity markets of third countries are closely integrated into that of the Union through market coupling,
technical solutions should be found to ensure the application of the CBAM to electricity exported from those
countries into the customs territory of the Union. If technical solutions cannot be found, third countries whose
markets are coupled with that of the Union should benefit from a time-limited exemption from the CBAM
until 2030 with regard solely to the export of electricity, provided that certain conditions are met. Those third
countries should, however, develop a roadmap and commit to implementing a carbon pricing mechanism
providing for a price that is equivalent to the EU ETS, and should commit to achieving carbon neutrality at the latest
by 2050 as well as to align with Union legislation in the areas of environment, climate, competition and energy. Such
exemption should be withdrawn at any time if there are reasons to believe that the country in question does not fulfil
its commitments or if it has not adopted by 2030 an emissions trading system equivalent to the EU ETS.
```
```
(57) Transitional provisions should apply for a limited period of time. For that purpose, the CBAM should apply without
financial adjustment, with the objective of facilitating its smooth roll-out, thereby reducing the risk of disruptive
impacts on trade. Importers should have to report on a quarterly basis the embedded emissions in goods imported
during the previous quarter of the calendar year, setting out direct and indirect emissions as well as any carbon
price effectively paid abroad. The last CBAM report, which is the report to be submitted for the last quarter of
2025, should be submitted by 31 January 2026.
```
```
(58) To facilitate and ensure a proper functioning of the CBAM, the Commission should provide support to the
competent authorities in carrying out their functions and duties under this Regulation. The Commission should
coordinate, issue guidelines and support the exchange of best practices.
```
```
(59) In order to apply this Regulation in a cost-efficient way, the Commission should manage the CBAM registry
containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries.
```
```
(60) A common central platform should be established for the sale and repurchase of CBAM certificates. With a view to
overseeing the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchange of
information and the cooperation between competent authorities, as well as between those authorities and the
Commission. Furthermore, a rapid flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM
registry should be established.
```
```
(61) To contribute to the effective application of this Regulation, the Commission should carry out risk-based controls
and should review the content of CBAM declarations accordingly.
```
```
(62) In order to further enable a uniform application of this Regulation, the Commission should, as a preliminary input,
make available to the competent authorities its own calculations regarding the CBAM certificates to be surrendered,
on the basis of its review of the CBAM declarations. Such preliminary input should be provided for indicative
purposes only and without prejudice to the definitive calculation to be made by the competent authority. In
particular, no right of appeal or other remedial measure should be possible against such preliminary input made by
the Commission.

(63) Member States should also be able to carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations for enforcement purposes.
The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission. Those
conclusions should also be made available to other competent authorities via the CBAM registry.
```
```
(64) Member States should be responsible for correctly establishing and collecting revenues arising from the application
of this Regulation.
```
```
(65) The Commission should regularly evaluate the application of this Regulation and report to the European Parliament
and to the Council. Those reports should in particular focus on possibilities to enhance climate actions towards
reaching the objective of a climate-neutral Union at the latest by 2050. The Commission should, as part of that
reporting, collect the information necessary with a view to the further extension of the scope of this Regulation to
embedded indirect emissions in the goods listed in Annex II as soon as possible, as well as to other goods and
services that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products, and to developing methods of
calculating embedded emissions based on the environmental footprint methods, as set out in Commission
Recommendation 2013/179/EU(^16 ). Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM
on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, social and territorial impact throughout the
Union, taking into account also the special characteristics and constraints of outermost regions referred to in
Article 349 TFEU and of island States which are part of the customs territory of the Union.
```
```
(66) Practices of circumvention of this Regulation should be monitored and addressed by the Commission, including
where operators could slightly modify their goods without altering their essential characteristics, or artificially split
shipments, in order to avoid the obligations under this Regulation. Situations where goods would be sent to a third
country or region prior to their importation to the Union market, with the aim of avoiding the obligations under
this Regulation, or where operators in third countries would export their less greenhouse gas emissions intensive
products to the Union and keep their more greenhouse gas emissions intensive products for other markets, or
reorganisation by exporters or producers of their patterns and channels of sale and production, or any other kinds
of dual production and dual sale practices, with the aim of avoiding the obligations under this Regulation, should
also be monitored.
```
```
(67) In full respect of the principles set out in this Regulation, work on extending the scope of this Regulation should
have the aim of including, by 2030, all the sectors covered by Directive 2003/87/EC. Therefore, when reviewing
and evaluating the application of this Regulation, the Commission should maintain a reference to this timeline, and
give priority to including within the scope of this Regulation greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods that are
most exposed to carbon leakage and that are most carbon intensive, as well as in downstream products that contain
a significant share of at least one of the goods within the scope of this Regulation. Should the Commission not
submit a legislative proposal for such an extension, by 2030, of the scope of this Regulation, it should inform the
European Parliament and the Council of the reasons and take the necessary steps towards achieving the objective of
including, as soon as possible, all the sectors covered by Directive 2003/87/EC.
```
```
(68) The Commission should also present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of
this Regulation two years from the end of the transitional period, and every two years thereafter. The timing for the
submission of the reports should follow the timetables on the functioning of the carbon market pursuant to
Article 10(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The reports should contain an assessment of the impacts of the CBAM.
```
```
(69) In order to allow for a rapid and effective response to unforeseeable, exceptional and unprovoked circumstances that
have destructive consequences on the economic and industrial infrastructure of one or more third countries subject
to the CBAM, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal,
as appropriate, amending this Regulation. Such a legislative proposal should set out the measures that are most
appropriate in light of the circumstances that the third country or countries are facing, while preserving the
objectives of this Regulation. Those measures should be limited in time.

```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/


```
(70) A dialogue with third countries should continue and there should be space for cooperation and solutions that could
inform the specific choices to be made on the details of the CBAM during its implementation, in particular during
the transitional period.
```
```
(71) The Commission should strive to engage in an even-handed manner and in line with the international obligations of
the Union with the third countries whose trade to the Union is affected by this Regulation, in order to explore the
possibility for dialogue and cooperation regarding the implementation of specific elements of the CBAM. The
Commission should also explore the possibility of concluding agreements that take into account the carbon pricing
mechanism of third countries. The Union should provide technical assistance for those purposes to developing
countries and to least developed countries as identified by the United Nations (LDCs).
```
```
(72) The establishment of the CBAM calls for the development of bilateral, multilateral and international cooperation
with third countries. For that purpose, a forum of countries with carbon pricing instruments or other comparable
instruments (‘Climate Club’) should be set up, in order to promote the implementation of ambitious climate policies
in all countries and pave the way for a global carbon pricing framework. The Climate Club should be open,
voluntary, non-exclusive and directed in particular at aiming for high climate ambition in line with the Paris
Agreement. The Climate Club could function under the auspices of a multilateral international organisation and
should facilitate the comparison and, where appropriate, coordination of relevant measures with an impact on
emission reduction. The Climate Club should also support the comparability of relevant climate measures by
ensuring the quality of climate monitoring, reporting and verification among its members and providing means for
engagement and transparency between the Union and its trade partners.
```
```
(73) In order to further support the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement in third countries, it is desirable that
the Union continue to provide financial support through the Union budget towards climate mitigation and
adaptation in LDCs, including in their efforts towards the decarbonisation and transformation of their
manufacturing industries. That Union support should also contribute to facilitating the adaptation of the industries
concerned to the new regulatory requirements stemming from this Regulation.
```
```
(74) As the CBAM aims to encourage cleaner production, the Union is committed to working with and supporting low
and middle-income third countries towards the decarbonisation of their manufacturing industries as part of the
external dimension of the European Green Deal and in line with the Paris Agreement. The Union should continue
to support those countries through the Union budget, especially LDCs, in order to contribute to ensuring their
adaptation to the obligations under this Regulation. The Union should also continue to support climate mitigation
and adaptation in those countries, including in their efforts towards the decarbonisation and transformation of their
manufacturing industries, within the ceiling of the multi-annual financial framework and the financial support
provided by the Union to international climate finance. The Union is working towards introducing a new own
resource based on the revenues generated by the sale of CBAM certificates.

— supplementing this Regulation by laying down requirements and procedures for third countries or territories
that have been removed from the list in point 2 of Annex III, to ensure the application of this Regulation to
those countries or territories with regard to electricity;
```
```
— amending the list of third countries and territories listed in point 1 or 2 of Annex III, either by adding those
countries or territories to that list, in order to exclude from the CBAM those third countries or territories that
are fully integrated into, or linked to, the EU ETS in the event of future agreements, or by removing third
countries or territories from that list, thereby subjecting them to the CBAM, where they do not effectively
charge the EU ETS price on goods exported to the Union;
```
```
— supplementing this Regulation by specifying the conditions for granting accreditation to verifiers, control and
oversight of accredited verifiers, withdrawal of accreditation, and mutual recognition and peer evaluation of the
accreditation bodies;
```
```
— supplementing this Regulation by further defining the timing, administration and other aspects of the sale and
repurchase of CBAM certificates; and
```
```
— amending the list of goods in Annex I by adding, in certain circumstances, goods that have been slightly
modified, in order to strengthen measures that address practices of circumvention.
```
```
It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work,
including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in
the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016on Better Law-Making(^20 ). In particular, to ensure equal
participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at
the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission
expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
```
```
(78) Such consultations should be conducted in a transparent manner and may include prior consultations of
stakeholders, such as competent bodies, industry (including SMEs), social partners such as trade unions, civil society
organisations and environmental organisations.
```
```
(79) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be
conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/

```
(80) The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the
expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost,
wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties. The CBAM should
therefore rely on appropriate and effective mechanisms for avoiding losses of revenues.
```
```
(81) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global
carbon emissions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and
effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of
proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve
those objectives.

CHAPTER I
```
```
SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS
```
```
Article 1
```
```
Subject matter
```
1. This Regulation establishes a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) to address greenhouse gas emissions
embedded in the goods listed in Annex I on their importation into the customs territory of the Union in order to prevent
the risk of carbon leakage, thereby reducing global carbon emissions and supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement, also
by creating incentives for the reduction of emissions by operators in third countries.
2. The CBAM complements the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union established
under Directive 2003/87/EC (the ‘EU ETS’) by applying an equivalent set of rules to imports into the customs territory of
the Union of the goods referred to in Article 2 of this Regulation.
3. The CBAM is set to replace the mechanisms established under Directive 2003/87/EC to prevent the risk of carbon
leakage by reflecting the extent to which EU ETS allowances are allocated free of charge in accordance with Article 10a of
that Directive.

```
Article 2
```
```
Scope
```
1. This Regulation applies to goods listed in Annex I originating in a third country, where those goods, or processed
products from those goods resulting from the inward processing procedure referred to in Article 256 of Regulation (EU)
No 952/2013, are imported into the customs territory of the Union.
2. This Regulation also applies to goods listed in Annex I to this Regulation originating in a third country, where those
goods, or processed products from those goods resulting from the inward processing procedure referred to in Article 256
of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, are brought to an artificial island, a fixed or floating structure, or any other structure on
the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State that is adjacent to the customs territory of the
Union.

```
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down detailed conditions for the application of the CBAM to such
goods, in particular as regards the notions equivalent to those of importation into the customs territory of the Union and
of release for free circulation, as regards the procedures relating to the submission of the CBAM declaration in respect of
such goods and the controls to be carried out by customs authorities. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in
accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2) of this Regulation.
```
3. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, this Regulation shall not apply to:

```
(a) goods listed in Annex I to this Regulation which are imported into the customs territory of the Union provided that the
intrinsic value of such goods does not exceed, per consignment, the value specified for goods of negligible value as
referred to in Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009(^22 );
```
```
(b) goods contained in the personal luggage of travellers coming from a third country provided that the intrinsic value of
such goods does not exceed the value specified for goods of negligible value as referred to in Article 23 of Regulation
(EC) No 1186/2009;

```
4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, this Regulation shall not apply to goods originating in the third
countries and territories listed in point 1 of Annex III.
5. Imported goods shall be considered as originating in third countries in accordance with the rules for non-preferential
origin as referred to in Article 59 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.
6. Third countries and territories shall be listed in point 1 of Annex III where they fulfil all the following conditions:

```
(a) the EU ETS applies to that third country or territory or an agreement has been concluded between that third country or
territory and the Union fully linking the EU ETS and the emission trading system of that third country or territory;
```
```
(b) the carbon price paid in the country in which the goods originate is effectively charged on the greenhouse gas
emissions embedded in those goods without any rebates beyond those also applied in accordance with the EU ETS.
```
7. If a third country or territory has an electricity market which is integrated with the Union internal market for
electricity through market coupling, and there is no technical solution for the application of the CBAM to the importation
of electricity into the customs territory of the Union from that third country or territory, such importation of electricity
from that country or territory shall be exempt from the application of the CBAM, provided that the Commission has
assessed that all of the following conditions have been fulfilled in accordance with paragraph 8:

```
(a) the third country or territory has concluded an agreement with the Union which sets out an obligation to apply Union
law in the field of electricity, including the legislation on the development of renewable energy sources, as well as other
rules in the field of energy, environment and competition;
```
```
(b) the domestic legislation in that third country or territory implements the main provisions of Union electricity market
legislation, including on the development of renewable energy sources and the market coupling of electricity markets;
```
```
(c) the third country or territory has submitted a roadmap to the Commission which contains a timetable for the adoption
of measures to implement the conditions set out in points (d) and (e);
```
```
(d) the third country or territory has committed to climate neutrality by 2050 and, where applicable, has accordingly
formally formulated and communicated to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
a mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategy aligned with that objective, and has
implemented that commitment in its domestic legislation;
```
```
(e) the third country or territory has, when implementing the roadmap referred to in point (c), demonstrated its fulfilment
of the set deadlines and the substantial progress towards the alignment of domestic legislation with Union law in the
field of climate action on the basis of that roadmap, including towards carbon pricing at a level equivalent to that in
the Union in particular insofar as the generation of electricity is concerned; the implementation of an emissions
trading system for electricity, with a price equivalent to the EU ETS, is to be finalised by 1 January 2030;
```
```

8. A third country or territory that fulfils all the conditions set out in paragraph 7, shall be listed in point 2 of Annex III,
and shall submit two reports on the fulfilment of those conditions, the first report by 1 July 2025and the second by
31 December 2027. By 31 December 2025 and by 1 July 2028, the Commission shall assess, in particular on the basis of
the roadmap referred to in paragraph 7, point (c), and the reports received from the third country or territory, if that third
country or territory continues to fulfil the conditions set out in paragraph 7.
9. A third country or territory listed in point 2 of Annex III shall be removed from that list where one or more of the
following conditions applies:

```
(a) the Commission has reasons to consider that that third country or territory has not shown sufficient progress to
comply with one of the conditions set out in paragraph 7, or that third country or territory has taken action that is
incompatible with the objectives set out in the Union climate and environmental legislation;
```
```
(b) that third country or territory has taken steps that are contrary to its decarbonisation objectives, such as providing
public support for the establishment of new generation capacity that emits more than 550 grammes of carbon dioxide
(‘CO 2 ’) of fossil fuel origin per kilowatt-hour of electricity;
```
```
(c) the Commission has evidence that, as a result of increased exports of electricity to the Union, the emissions per
kilowatt-hour of electricity produced in that third country or territory have increased by at least 5 % compared to
1 January 2026.
```
10. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 28 in order to supplement this
Regulation by laying down requirements and procedures for third countries or territories that have been removed from the
list in point 2 of Annex III, to ensure the application of this Regulation to those countries or territories with regard to
electricity. If in such cases market coupling remains incompatible with the application of this Regulation, the Commission
may decide to exclude those third countries or territories from Union market coupling and require explicit capacity
allocation at the border between the Union and those third countries or territories, so that the CBAM can apply.
11. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 28 in order to amend the lists of
third countries or territories listed in point 1 or 2 of Annex III by adding or removing a third country or territory,
depending on whether the conditions set out in paragraph 6, 7 or 9 of this Article are fulfilled in respect of that third
country or territory.

well as in the case of indirect emissions, the embedded emissions shall be determined by reference to default values in
accordance with the methods set out in point 4.1 of Annex IV.
3. Embedded emissions in imported electricity shall be determined by reference to default values in accordance with the
method set out in point 4.2 of Annex IV, unless the authorised CBAM declarant demonstrates that the criteria to determine
the embedded emissions based on the actual emissions listed in point 5 of Annex IV are met.

L 130/70 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.


4. Embedded indirect emissions shall be calculated in accordance with the method set out in point 4.3 of Annex IV and
further specified in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, unless the authorised CBAM
declarant demonstrates that the criteria to determine the embedded emissions based on actual emissions that are listed in
point 6 of Annex IV are met.
5. The authorised CBAM declarant shall keep records of the information required to calculate the embedded emissions
in accordance with the requirements laid down in Annex V. Those records shall be sufficiently detailed to enable verifiers
accredited pursuant to Article 18 to verify the embedded emissions in accordance with Article 8 and Annex VI and to
enable the Commission and the competent authority to review the CBAM declaration in accordance with Article 19(2).
6. The authorised CBAM declarant shall keep those records of information referred to in paragraph 5, including the
report of the verifier, until the end of the fourth year after the year in which the CBAM declaration has been or should
have been submitted.
7. The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts concerning:

(a) the application of the elements of the calculation methods set out in Annex IV, including determining system
boundaries of production processes and relevant input materials (precursors), emission factors, installation-specific
values of actual emissions and default values and their respective application to individual goods as well as laying
down methods to ensure the reliability of data on the basis of which the default values shall be determined, including
the level of detail and the verification of the data, and including further specification of goods that are to be considered
as ‘simple goods’ and ‘complex goods’ for the purpose of point 1 of Annex IV; those implementing acts shall also
specify the conditions under which it is deemed that actual emissions cannot be adequately determined, as well as the
elements of evidence demonstrating that the criteria required to justify the use of actual emissions for electricity
consumed in the production processes of goods for the purpose of paragraph 2 that are listed in points 5 and 6 of
Annex IV are met; and
```
```
(b) the application of the elements of the calculation methods pursuant to paragraph 4 in accordance with point 4.3 of
Annex IV.
```
```
Where objectively justified, the implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph shall provide that default values can
be adapted to particular areas, regions or countries to take into account specific objective factors that affect emissions, such
as prevailing energy sources or industrial processes. Those implementing acts shall build upon existing legislation for the
monitoring and verification of emissions and activity data for installations covered by Directive 2003/87/EC, in particular
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066(^24 ), Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 and Commission

Circumvention
```
1. The Commission shall take action in accordance with this Article, based on relevant and objective data, to address
practices of circumvention of this Regulation.
2. Practices of circumvention shall be defined as a change in the pattern of trade in goods, which stems from a practice,
process or work, for which there is insufficient due cause or economic justification other than to avoid, wholly or partially,
any of the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Such practice, process or work may consist of, but is not limited to:

```
(a) slightly modifying the goods concerned to make those goods fall under CN codes which are not listed in Annex I,
except where the modification alters their essential characteristics;
```
```
(b) artificially splitting shipments into consignments the intrinsic value of which does not exceed the threshold referred to
in Article 2(3).

paragraph 2 may notify the Commission if it is confronted with practices of circumvention. Interested parties other than
directly affected or benefited parties, such as environmental organisations and non-governmental organisations, which
find concrete evidence of practices of circumvention may also notify the Commission.

L 130/82 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


5. The notification referred to in paragraph 4 shall state the reasons on which it is based and shall include relevant data
and statistics to support the claim of circumvention of this Regulation. The Commission shall initiate an investigation into a
claim of circumvention either where it has been notified by a Member State, or by an affected, benefited or other interested
party, provided that the notification meets the requirements referred to in this paragraph, or where the Commission itself
determines that such an investigation is necessary. In carrying out the investigation, the Commission may be assisted by
the competent authorities and customs authorities. The Commission shall conclude the investigation within nine months
from the date of notification. Where an investigation has been initiated, the Commission shall notify all competent
authorities.
6. Where the Commission, taking into account the relevant data, reports and statistics, including those provided by
customs authorities, has sufficient reasons to believe that the circumstances referred to in paragraph 2, point (a) of this
Article, are occurring in one or more Member States by way of an established pattern, it is empowered to adopt delegated
acts in accordance with Article 28 to amend the list of goods in Annex I by adding the relevant slightly modified products
referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article, for anti-circumvention purposes.

3. At least one year before the end of the transitional period, the Commission shall present a report to the European
Parliament and to the Council that identifies products further down the value chain of the goods listed in Annex I that it
recommends to be considered for inclusion within the scope of this Regulation. To that end, the Commission shall
develop, in a timely manner, a methodology that should be based on relevance in terms of cumulated greenhouse gas
emissions and risk of carbon leakage.
4. The reports referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal by
the end of the transitional period, including a detailed impact assessment, in particular with a view to extending the scope

ANNEX IV
```
```
Methods for calculating embedded emissions for the purpose of Article 7
```
## 1. DEFINITIONS

```
For the purposes of this Annex and of Annexes V and VI, the following definitions apply:
```
```
(a) ‘simple goods’ means goods produced in a production process requiring exclusively input materials (precursors)
and fuels having zero embedded emissions;
```
```
(b) ‘complex goods’ means goods other than simple goods;
```
```
(c) ‘specific embedded emissions’ means the embedded emissions of one tonne of goods, expressed as tonnes of
CO 2 e emissions per tonne of goods;
```
```
(d) ‘CO 2 emission factor’, means the weighted average of the CO 2 intensity of electricity produced from fossil fuels
within a geographic area; the CO 2 emission factor is the result of the division of the CO 2 emission data of the
electricity sector by the gross electricity generation based on fossil fuels in the relevant geographic area; it is
expressed in tonnes of CO 2 per megawatt-hour;
```
```
(e) ‘emission factor for electricity’ means the default value, expressed in CO 2 e, representing the emission intensity of
electricity consumed in production of goods;
```
```
(f) ‘power purchase agreement’ means a contract under which a person agrees to purchase electricity directly from
an electricity producer;
```
```
(g) ‘transmission system operator’ means an operator as defined in Article 2, point (35), of Directive (EU) 2019/944
of the European Parliament and of the Council(^1 ).
```
## 2. DETERMINATION OF ACTUAL SPECIFIC EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR SIMPLE GOODS

```
For determining the specific actual embedded emissions of simple goods produced in a given installation, direct and,
where applicable, indirect emissions shall be accounted for. For that purpose, the following equation is to be applied:
```
```
SEEg¼
```
```
AttrEmg
ALg
```
```
Where:
```
```
SEEg are the specific embedded emissions of goods g, in terms of CO 2 e per tonne;
AttrEmg are the attributed emissions of goods g, and
```
```
ALg is the activity level of the goods, being the quantity of the goods produced in the reporting period
in that installation.
```
```
‘Attributed emissions’ mean the part of the installation’s emissions during the reporting period that are caused by
the production process resulting in goods g when applying the system boundaries of the production process
defined by the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7). The attributed emissions shall be calculated
using the following equation:
```
```
AttrEmg¼DirEmþIndirEm
```
```
Where:
```
```
DirEm are the direct emissions, resulting from the production process, expressed in tonnes of CO 2 e,
within the system boundaries referred to in the implementing act adopted pursuant to
Article 7(7), and
```
```
(^1 ) Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for
electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (OJ L 158, 14.6.2019, p. 125).
```
L 130/98 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


```
IndirEm are the indirect emissions resulting from the production of electricity consumed in the production
processes of goods, expressed in tonnes of CO 2 e, within the system boundaries referred to in the
implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 7(7).
```
## 3. DETERMINATION OF ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR COMPLEX GOODS

```
For determining the specific actual embedded emissions of complex goods produced in a given installation, the
following equation is to be applied:
```
```
SEEg¼
```
```
AttrEmgþEEInpMat
ALg
```
```
Where:
```
```
AttrEmg are the attributed emissions of goods g;
ALg is the activity level of the goods, being the quantity of goods produced in the reporting period in
that installation, and
EEInpMat are the embedded emissions of the input materials (precursors) consumed in the production
process. Only input materials (precursors) listed as relevant to the system boundaries of the
production process as specified in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) are to
be considered. The relevant EEInpMat are calculated as follows:
```
# EEImpMat¼∑

```
n
```
```
i¼ 1
```
```
Mi·SEEi
```
```
Where:
```
```
Mi is the mass of input material (precursor) i used in the production process, and
SEEi are the specific embedded emissions for the input material (precursor) i. For SEEi the operator of
the installation shall use the value of emissions resulting from the installation where the input
material (precursor) was produced, provided that that installation’s data can be adequately
measured.
```
## 4. DETERMINATION OF DEFAULT VALUES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 7(2) AND (3)

```
For the purpose of determining default values, only actual values shall be used for the determination of embedded
emissions. In the absence of actual data, literature values may be used. The Commission shall publish guidance for
the approach taken to correct for waste gases or greenhouse gases used as process input, before collecting the data
required to determine the relevant default values for each type of goods listed in Annex I. Default values shall be
determined based on the best available data. Best available data shall be based on reliable and publicly available
information. Default values shall be revised periodically through the implementing acts adopted pursuant to
Article 7(7) based on the most up-to-date and reliable information, including on the basis of information provided
by a third country or group of third countries.
```
```
4.1. Default values referred to in Article 7(2)
```
```
When actual emissions cannot be adequately determined by the authorised CBAM declarant, default values shall be
used. Those values shall be set at the average emission intensity of each exporting country and for each of the goods
listed in Annex I other than electricity, increased by a proportionately designed mark-up. This mark-up shall be
determined in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) and shall be set at an appropriate level to
ensure the environmental integrity of the CBAM, building on the most up-to-date and reliable information,
including on the basis of information gathered during the transitional period. When reliable data for the exporting
country cannot be applied for a type of goods, the default values shall be based on the average emission intensity of
the X % worst performing EU ETS installations for that type of goods. The value of X shall be determined in the
implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(7) and shall be set at an appropriate level to ensure the
environmental integrity of the CBAM, building on the most up-to-date and reliable information, including on the
basis of information gathered during the transitional period.
```
16.5.2023 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 130/99


```
4.2. Default values for imported electricity referred to in Article 7(3)
```
```
Default values for imported electricity shall be determined for a third country, group of third countries or region
within a third country based on either specific default values, in accordance with point 4.2.1, or, if those values are
not available, on alternative default values, in accordance with point 4.2.2.
```
```
Where the electricity is produced in a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country, and
transits through third countries, groups of third countries, regions within a third country or Member States with
the purpose of being imported into the Union, the default values to be used are those from the third country, group
of third countries or region within a third country where the electricity was produced.
```
```
4.2.1.Specific default values for a third country, group of third countries or region within a third country
```
```
Specific default values shall be set at the CO 2 emission factor in the third country, group of third countries or region
within a third country, based on the best data available to the Commission.
```
```
4.2.2.Alternative default values
```
```
Where a specific default value is not available for a third country, a group of third countries, or a region within a
third country, the alternative default value for electricity shall be set at the CO 2 emission factor in the Union.
```
```
Where it can be demonstrated, on the basis of reliable data, that the CO 2 emission factor in a third country, a group
of third countries or a region within a third country is lower than the specific default value determined by the
Commission or lower than the CO 2 emission factor in the Union, an alternative default value based on that CO 2
emission factor may be used for that third country, group of third countries or region within a third country.
```
```
4.3 Default values for embedded indirect emissions
```
```
Default values for the indirect emissions embedded in a good produced in a third country shall be determined on a
default value calculated on the average, of either the emission factor of the Union electricity grid, the emission factor
of the country of origin electricity grid or the CO 2 emission factor of price-setting sources in the country of origin,
of the electricity used for the production of that good.
```
```
Where a third country, or a group of third countries, demonstrates to the Commission, on the basis of reliable data,
that the average electricity mix emission factor or CO 2 emission factor of price-setting sources in the third country
or group of third countries is lower than the default value for indirect emissions, an alternative default value based
on that average CO 2 emission factor shall be established for this country or group of countries.
```
```
The Commission shall adopt, no later than 30 June 2025, an implementing act pursuant to Article 7(7) to further
specify which of the calculation methods determined in accordance with the first subparagraph shall apply to the
calculation of default values. For that purpose, the Commission shall base itself on the most up-to-date and reliable
data, including on data gathered during the transitional period, as regards the quantity of electricity used for the
production of the goods listed in Annex I, as well as the country of origin, generation source and emission factors
related to that electricity. The specific calculation method shall be determined on the basis of the most appropriate
way to achieve both of the following criteria:
```
```
— the prevention of carbon leakage;
```
```
— ensuring the environmental integrity of the CBAM.
```
## 5. CONDITIONS FOR APPLYING ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS IN IMPORTED ELECTRICITY

```
An authorised CBAM declarant may apply actual embedded emissions instead of default values for the calculation
referred to in Article 7(3) if the following cumulative criteria are met:
```
L 130/100 EN Official Journal of the European Union 16.5.2023


```
(a) the amount of electricity for which the use of actual embedded emissions is claimed is covered by a power
purchase agreement between the authorised CBAM declarant and a producer of electricity located in a third
country;
(b) the installation producing electricity is either directly connected to the Union transmission system or it can be
demonstrated that at the time of export there was no physical network congestion at any point in the network
between the installation and the Union transmission system;
(c) the installation producing electricity does not emit more than 550 grammes of CO 2 of fossil fuel origin per
kilowatt-hour of electricity;
(d) the amount of electricity for which the use of actual embedded emissions is claimed has been firmly nominated
to the allocated interconnection capacity by all responsible transmission system operators in the country of
origin, the country of destination and, if relevant, each country of transit, and the nominated capacity and the
production of electricity by the installation refer to the same period of time, which shall not be longer than one
hour;
(e) the fulfilment of the above criteria is certified by an accredited verifier, who shall receive at least monthly
interim reports demonstrating how those criteria are fulfilled.
The accumulated amount of electricity under the power purchase agreement and its corresponding actual embedded
emissions shall be excluded from the calculation of the country emission factor or the CO 2 emission factor used for
the purpose of the calculation of indirect electricity embedded emissions in goods in accordance with point 4.3,
respectively.
```
## 6. CONDITIONS TO APPLYING ACTUAL EMBEDDED EMISSIONS FOR INDIRECT EMISSIONS

```
An authorised CBAM declarant may apply actual embedded emissions instead of default values for the calculation
referred to in Article 7(4) if it can demonstrate a direct technical link between the installation in which the
imported good is produced and the electricity generation source or if the operator of that installation has
concluded a power purchase agreement with a producer of electricity located in a third country for an amount of
electricity that is equivalent to the amount for which the use of a specific value is claimed.
```
## 7. ADAPTATION OF DEFAULT VALUES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 7(2) BASED ON REGION-SPECIFIC FEATURES

```
Default values can be adapted to particular areas and regions within third countries where specific characteristics
prevail in terms of objective emission factors. When data adapted to those specific local characteristics are available
and more targeted default values can be determined, the latter may be used.
Where declarants for goods originating in a third country, a group of third countries or a region within a third
country can demonstrate, on the basis of reliable data, that alternative region-specific adaptations of default values
are lower than the default values determined by the Commission, such region-specific adaptations can be used.

The following principles shall apply:
```
```
(a) verifiers shall carry out verifications with an attitude of professional scepticism;
```
```
(b)the total embedded emissions to be declared in the CBAM declaration shall be considered as verified only if the

non-conformities regarding the calculation of embedded emissions in accordance with the rules of Annex IV;
```
```
(c) installation visits by the verifier shall be mandatory except where specific criteria for waiving the installation visit
are met;
```

(d)for deciding whether misstatements or non-conformities are material, the verifier shall use thresholds given by the
implementing acts adopted in accordance with Article 8(3).
```
```
For parameters for which no such thresholds are determined, the verifier shall use expert judgement as to whether
misstatements or non-conformities, individually or when aggregated with other misstatements or non-
conformities, justified by their size and nature, are to be considered material.
