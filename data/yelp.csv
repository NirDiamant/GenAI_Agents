There's a nice salad bar, several different soups, antipasto selections, various buns and bread, pastas as well as a custom pasta station where the chefs make your pasta right in front of you. At the meat carving station, I believe each day they have different options. The day I went, it was turkey and prime rib. The prime rib was AMAZING. It was so tender, and done medium rare, just the way I like it. I had to go back for seconds, it was that good. 

There's a few selections of Indian cuisine as well as Chinese, sushi, and a chilled seafood section (of course, Alaskan king crab legs).

The desserts are in an entirely different section, where it's like its own separate shop full o' sweet things.Gelato, cakes, baked goods, fresh fruit, and a crepe station.

The rating is a little low because while the selection was great, the tastes of the food wasn't as great. The custom tom yum soup was super salty, the veal shortribs were a tad dry, and the stir fried Asian vegetables were absolutely soaked in oil and probably had more than its fair share of MSG. The desserts didn't get any better either: the red velvet cupcakes were dry, most of the cakes were way too sweet, and there was something off about the crepes. It could've been the chocolate sauce, or the strong taste of Pam that the chef used to make the crepe.

Despite some of the lackluster food, I did enjoy the butternut squash risotto, the orecchiette with creamy pesto sauce, and of course, the prime rib (I'll be dreaming about it for months). The baked chocolate brownie was yummy despite the nuts, and the gelato was delicious.

$40 for dinner is a pretty standard Vegas buffet price, and with the Wynn, the ingredients they use are not as common (or cheap) as what other hotel buffets offer, so it's a good deal.

They offer a variety of cuisines that range from Asian, American, Italian, Indian, and Latino, had a few made-to-order sections, and also a salad bar. My picks were more of the American-Italian and seafood options, such as the meatloaf, pasta, mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail and baked salmon. The meatloaf was cooked just the way I like it, it had a soft texture, and seasoned well. Pasta was creamy and delicious, and the seafood was fresh. I also added corn and broccolini to balance out my meal, which were both cooked nicely, since I am not fond of tough, under-cooked vegetables.

Onto the desserts, my favorites were the raspberry cheesecake, chocolate lava (highly recommend) , and these edible cones topped with icing and a gummy candy. I also chose lychee ice cream and cookies and cream. They weren't overly sweet, both were on the light side.

The quality of the food varied. The positives included the crab legs, swordfish, and veal shank (although I was very careful to pick the best looking pieces from the chafing dishes). The negatives were the dry prime rib (yes, very sad for the old Vegas buffet tradition), the drier salmon en croute, the soggy fried chicken, and the soggier Italian corn cake. Too bad there wasn't some way to just have my favorites and nothing else.

The drinks were really good. The blueberry comso and the white sangria were high-end concoctions, but little light on the pour.

The waited also clears the plates, but doesn't replace silverware.

They've done a nice job with the dessert buffet. It's a far cry from squares of Jello like at cafeteria buffets. The selection is large and most of it is above average. It was also nice that the desserts were cut into small portions so more could be tried.

The taco bar would also make tofu or garden burger tacos on request. Want rigatoni without meatballs?  No problem. Want a vegan pizza? Done. Don't forget about vegan ravioli.  Of course this is all in addition to the clearly marked vegan soup they always have. 

If you are veg in Vegas and want a buffet you really can't go wrong here. The thing that is most impressive here is when I ask ""does this have meat in it?"" The answer is always confident.  If the person behind the line does not know, they will find out for you.",0,0,0,"""The Buffet""",The Strip,"""3131 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1268872232,-115.165590048,3.5,4018,1,Buffets;Restaurants

Tried multiple items:
Lobster bisque- good
Fried Chicken tasty
Prime Rib- all over cooked (horrible gray)to the point there was no flavor
Quail- same as the prime rib little to no flavor and overcooked
Duck-overcooked
Needless to say I tried multiple meat dishes and had them discarded because the dishes were bland and overcooked. 
When we notified the staff, the wait staff was very cordial and sent over a manager. The experience with the manager was probably the least ingenuine display of empathy in her eyes even though the words coming out of her mouth made it sound like she cared.

I'm not sure what I ate here that was special. Your lychee ice cream was good, but shouldn't be the only star of the meal. 

5 of us girls came here for brunch and I was not amazed. The steak was okay, and sort of salty. The mac and cheese was also okay, but nothing wow. I did like their asian selection - shaumai, shrimp dumpling, porridge with black egg and pork sung - yum. 

Something else I enjoyed was their green tea chia seed dessert puree. It was coconuty and had a very refreshing chill and flavor. Another star of the desserts section! 

I did have some of their stir fried veggies and green beans as well and those were fresh. 

Other than that no honorable mentions. The lobster quiche was horrendous - it tasted like rotten egg with itty bits of lobster. The sushi section looked like below average sushi buffet - so I didn't even bother. Fried clam meat? Hardly any clam in the batter - all flour. 

They had this raw tuna sitting in coconut liquid in the sushi section - not sure what that was supposed to be. The japanesey salad in that section was also disappointing. 

Like I said there were more mehs than wows. If you're sitting with a group and the food isn't amazing - I don't care what your place looks like but that's a shame.

12\/25\/16 Sunday:
My party of three entered the line at 4:18 p.m. Still waiting at 7:35 p.m. yet a few feet away from the cash registers and another 30+ minutes until we'd get seated, we stormed out.

TIME WASTED: 3.25 HOURS

Before entering the line, we asked and were told it was going to be a 2 hour wait. In reality, it was 3+ hour wait (2 hrs in the outside line, 1 hr in the inside line, they later told customers). While we waited, staff handed out small water bottles, which people littered all over the ground and railings. (How come nobody cleaned up this stuff? Thought the Wynn was classy, not trashy.) The Wynn's slow and spotty WiFi made the wait worse. Complained to the manager Rhonda (sp?) about the 3+ hr wait and she only apologized and told us that it was a 15 minute wait from where we stood a few feet from the registers. COMPLETE UNDERESTIMATION. There was a giant crowd of people from our regular wait line \/AND\/ the express line, standing by the cash registers still waiting to be seated. No end in sight.

We had a show to catch at 8:30 p.m. at Planet Hollywood. So we left without eating. Not surprising as a group from a couple families behind us did the same, as well.

We will never return to the Wynn to eat and will be writing a formal complaint. No buffet is worth this nonsense. Thanks for ruining our Christmas.",4,2,0,"""The Buffet""",The Strip,"""3131 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1268872232,-115.165590048,3.5,4018,1,Buffets;Restaurants

They charge 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.  We were six and the service was horrible.  She saw us twice. Once for order and once to give us the check.  No refills. No checking. Nothing.   We were going to tip 10% and to our amazement it was mandatory 18%.  I called the manager.  He came over and I told him the issue and to remove the 18%. Instead of apologizing, he put the blame back on us and said we should have asked for him.  Bottom line - we were blamed by the manager and the blame is put back on us. It shows issues not just by staff but by management. I said no and we would just walk out. He reluctantly removed the 18% and dropped the check back on our table. NO APOLOGY.  

The steak was overcooked for most of us. The mean was so so this time.  Its just a disappointment and there are tons of other options so I highly recommend if you are a party of 5 or more - be careful.  

The place is very dark too - hard to read menus and the chairs are wicker and uncomfortable- mostly to make the tables turn quicker.   It's obviously about the money there rather than service.  Go elsewhere.

I got the impression she was mad they sat a party of 6 at an 8 table.  We didn't want wine because we already drank and I thought she felt we weren't a big value table.  So figured she got 18% automatically and that was enough.  It wasn't crowded.  Amazed she never checked with us.   For a restaurant to make 18% mandatory for 5 or more shows they have service issues.

Pros: We requested to sit outside on the patio and the view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was absolutely gorgeous. Food was okay, hit and miss.

Cons: Horrendous service. Our service was not friendly or pleasant and ridiculously inattentive. We asked the busser and other servers for help a half dozen times. Our entrees came only minutes after the apps, no one likes when that happens, I expect more consideration from a nice place. The food only so so.

We had reservations which made seating quick and easy., even though the place was really packed. 

The waitress Christina was fantastic,  unfortunately,  her busboy was awful. We had to ask 3 times to get bread and soda refills.  We could see the busboy who often appeared to be looking off into space even though we tried to get his attention by waving and calling to him.  Christina was very apologetic and ended up getting the bread and soda herself. 

Everyone at the table enjoyed their food except for me.   I ordered the filet cooked medium and doubled checked how it was prepared to ensure I wouldn't have to send it back. Wouldn't you know it, it was over cooked.   Christina took it back,  but it was replaced with one that was rare.   Given that most of my party had nearly finished and I was starving  I chose to eat part of it and left the really rare part on the plate. Again Christina was profusely apologetic and it was removed from our bill. 

Overall, the staff took care of everything especially Christina and the manager.  The only thing I was surprised about is that while the gratuity was added in because of our party size, the gratuity was included for 2 filets even though they took them off the bill.

Had the wonderful opportunity to stay here in a terrace suite on the 46th floor overlooking the stip\/bellagio fountains.

Well what can I say, 

I'll start with PARKING. 

5 stars.

The garage is laid out very well and you are only a short walk to the elevator.
This can be quite convenient when going back and fourth from room to car.
Also, all of the spots have a really great LED system that is set up above the parking spot that lights up green when empty, and stays red when occupied. Thus making finding a spot MUCH MUCH EASIER!!!

SERVICE: 5 stars

From the check in desk, to the prompt security this place has their service ON POINT!!! I had an inncedent on my first night with a loud neighbor at 5:00 am.
I called the desk, noise was gone under 5 minutes. End result, a happy customer.

Hotel\/casino. Do I even have to say??  Of course it's 5 stars...

....It's a 4+ BILLION DOLLAR HOTEL!!!

Apparantly the whole ""city center project"" including vdara, mandarin oriental, veer towers, aria, as well as the cosmo and the defunct harmon, was IN TOTAl, 9 billion! before ressecion and inflation. 

Thus making the cosmopolitan absorb almost HALF the cost of the whole freakin place.

Uhh, ya... It's pretty effing nice. Probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in and seen.

Final word. Stay here.

I go to Las Vegas a couple of times a year and was looking forward to staying here.  The trouble started with check in. My admin had double checked the account, etc, however, when we got there, I had to practially start from scratch. Whomever at the hotel was in charge of the conference, didn't do a very good job of doing the double checking that we asked them to do.

Room was beautiful, but very dusty. Great amenities, though could not get either of the flat screens to work. Even the guy who came up couldn't  figure out what was wrong and said he would send up an engineer. I was out for the rest of the day, and the tv never did get fixed. One of my fellow conferencees discovered an old sock that wasn't his when he moved something and others never had their glassware changed out.  Check out was easy, though.

Highlights...Wicked spoon Buffet is awesome. 
Good restaurants, though very pricey.
 Easy to get around in if you are in any way disabled..everything is close, including the conference area..
GREAT VIEWS

Lowlights, poor attention to detail by housekeeping and the blaring music in the restaurants even at 6:45 am.

Drinks: usual Vegas poolside prices, weak drinks. But tastes good, for what it's worth.

Since I had never been to the Monte Carlo, I had lofty expectations.  Some of them were met, some fell very flat.

Pros - 
Location - easy to get to from the airport and in the middle of the action on the strip.  Valet is easy in and the staff was very nice.

The casino\/hotel area - very nice lobby and casino area.  It's clean and better ventilated than some others.  

Restaurants - the on site grubberies are generally better here than other properties.  Really likes the Pub and 800 Degrees.  Thought the location of the Steak House was strange (on the casino floor basically).

Cons -
The hotel portion could use a few bucks and some hours spiffing up.  The carpet in the hallways was dingy, dirty and wrinkled up.  Looked like my old Aunt Helen on a Friday night.  The room needs some sprucing - fix the sink, paint some walls, etc.

Security was lacking in the hotel area.  A young lady of the night rode the elevator with us as she was 'changing rooms' wearing one stalking and a men's shirt.  Crazy activity in the halls throughout the night as well.

One of the best things about this place is the Pub and it's tucked in the back, away from the strip.  The dueling pianos have been cancelled - with no wonder as the place is hard to find.

Wifi only on the bottom two floors.  Doesn't do much good to have a wireless device and a wired connection 30 floors up.

This hotel had been renovation few years ago, pump the hotel class from 3 1\/2 stars to 4 stars.  It located north of New York New York and next to Aria.  

Parking structure is easy in this hotel; you can easily access to the self-parking lot and can walk to the hotel in few minutes of walk. The parking escalator was fill with cigarette smell; I did not bother going back then.

The hotel room elevator is located across the lobby, the nice thing you do not need walks by the casino.  The room's elevators are separate by three different floors level.  That was good-crowed control. Our group came just right before the standard check in time 3pm in Sunday.  There has was about 20 peoples in the line, took about half hours before it was our turn.  The clerk was helpful and we were able to get a high floor level as we request.  The view was the city center (Aria, Vdara and the pool) It was good view despite this just a basic room.  At top of that our 2 booked room were together and also in a corner.  You would always wanted corner room if want peace in Zzz.

The room is modern; there is a big 42-inch flat screen.  However, sadly the channel were not in HD, make it look worse than SD.  One of the room amenities included 2 K-Cup Coffee Pack and two water bottles.  Those were included with the resort fee, which cost almost $23. I wish there is Wi-Fi in the room, only wired is available.  To use Wi-Fi has to go down to lounge level. The room was clean and everything was functional.  The bed and the pillow were very soft, perhaps more than the way I like it.  I had trouble sleep with the bed had to take another night to get used to it.

Their casino floor is modern as well; I was impress with their sport betting room.  Look more modern than five star hotel like Wynn.  The smell of the cigarette is not strong in the casino floor, unlike some other casino I been to.  There is free tram access to Crystal Center, Aria, and Bellagio. wish it also link the tram to Excalibur, so it can access to the southern strip.

Overall, this is good hotel consider the price.  You are only paying half or one third cost of nearby 4 or 5 stars hotel.  While is still in a decent near center strip location.

The rooms are OK.  They are average sized.  They are in decent shape.  The bathroom could use an update though.  You have to use a cable for Internet connection which is a shame.  That is not helpful for your iPad.

There are several fast food options on site which is convenient late at night.  It could use some more sit down options though.  The cigar lounge is a great place to relax while enjoying a good cigar and drink.

Our flight was scheduled to be in just before midnight so I let the hotel know i would be checking in late.  They let me know they would note it and informed me about that I could use the mobile check in and pick up my key at the kiosk. Upon arrival all the kiosks were black and another guest let me know they shut down at midnight. So I had no choice but to stand in a slow moving line that was LONG! Exactly the last thing i wanted to do after a 5 hour flight. So we get to our room and immediately go to take a shower. The tray on the counter was cracked, the wallpaper looked as if it as peeling and the fixtures covered in limescale.  The drain in the super must've been clogged because it almost immediately started to fill up the tub. So we figured we would deal with it we knew that we booked a hotel under renovation. Next came the bad experience at the spa here. You can see that review there. Then the next day we decided to sleep in. Even though its difficult seeing and hearing construcrion so early. Our room was not equipped with a ""privacy please"" sign so as soon as I heard the housekeepers in the hall I asked her nicely to not come in and if I could just get two new towels. She then tells me ""okay where's your old ones?"" So puzzled I ask her to hang on and go get them when she replied with ""And your trash where's all your trash bags?"" Ummm What? No thanks!  So that night we dined at the Italian restaraunt which was probably the highlight of the hotel. They had an amazing staff.  So the next day we went to the dinner buffet. I had a 2 for 1 and honestly it still wasn't worth it. Everything was salty. I mean unbearably salty. Nothing there was edible. And the next morning we decided to again torture ourselves with a breakfast buffet that was not salty but still not edible. It all tasted bad. Then we get back to our room to find a note saying they will shut off our water for 6 hours. 6 whole hours and all we were offered was bottle waters next to the elevator that was gone in the time it takes to walk from our room to the elevator. And no they didn't bother to refill it.  We weren't offered any sort of discount or anything. Then on the day of checkout we had an appointment between checkout and our flight so we decided to leave our stuff with the bell staff.  The person who took our bag was so pushy for a tip and I never heard of tipping before service? And he kept saying ""but i want be here when you get back but I'll take care of your stuff right now"" and sure enough when we got back he was still there and surprising not eager to help ANYONE in line. All in all worst experience. Don't stay here. It's not worth a dime. I wish I spoke to a manager when I was there but the checkout desk and the bell desk line was ridiculous and as stated we had an appointment.

Had not stayed there for some time but decided to do 3 days there on a recent extended stay in vegas. Look, it is not brand new and the rooms, at least some of them, can use some updating and work. I had a spa suite and it is clear it needs some updating but it was large and comfortable and clean. 

  I rented a cabana and it was great. The staff at the pool were exceptional. The cost was, if memory serves, about $500 but all food and drink purchases up to that amount are covered. At the end of the day we still had a significant amount left and they allowed us to purchase a bottle from their bottle-list to take back to the room. Nice touch. Also, we ate and drank our fill having steaks and large great-tasting drinks along with breakfast and other misc items. The staff was very friendly. The pool area itself is laid out well and also clean.

 We ate at D Vino and Dragon Noodle. Both were fine. We tried Diablo's cantina for lunch - can't say I am a huge fan. Seems way over-priced for mediocre tex-mex but the servings are quite large. 

 I just found the Monte Carlo to be unpretentious but quite acceptable and prices are fair. It would be nice to see some updates to the rooms and rumor has it that might be in the works but it is quite an acceptable and fun place to stay.

I got in line for check-in at 2:43 and had my room key by 3:02, which wasn't fast but wasn't as horrifying as some of the stories I have heard.  The clerk was slightly too curt, but she did her job thoroughly.

We were on the 17th floor facing the pools and did not hear any construction or noise the entire time, other than some strange tapping from another room a couple times the last night.

The room was almost well cleaned when we checked in (I found a clothing sticker and bandaid, but they weren't obvious).  The towels were very stiff and had a burnt smell to them (like they were in the dryer too long), while my mother felt her bed linens\/pillows had an ""off"" scent to them (I did not smell anything strange regarding mine).

Maid service was adequate, with the room cleaned every day with no problems.  I brought my own pillow (theirs are the usual awful soft ones), but do wish they had a comforter or heavier blanket option (it was very cold).  On that same note, the air conditioning is a relatively modern wall vent with a digital display.

The water pressure in the shower was AMAZING.  I cannot praise it enough, it basically solidified their fourth star.  The multiple Starbucks also helped them earn kudos.

I'll my review of their fully furnished but lackluster fitness center (inside\/past the spa) in the spa and salon's page.  Watch out for it closing early (6pm)!

Watch out for pushy manipulative salespeople in the Street of Dreams!

Check out the gift shop for Monte Carlo and Las Vegas logo goods.  You do get a discount with your mLife card, though I think the somewhat strange (talked to stuffed animals) older female cashier stiffed me (it looks like she didn't apply the discount to all the items).  The MC goods might even become collectibles if the hotel does change its name...

Besides the initial clerk, all the other employees of the hotel were very friendly and professional, including the maid, concierges, bellhop, and valet employees.
There was one concierge who printed my ""will call"" tickets for Ka at MGM Grand for me and offered excellent directions via two different routes, complete with a map.

Their location is fantastic, sandwiched between two higher-end resorts (Aria and Bellagio, with other neighbors including Cosmopolitan, Vdara, and Mandarin Oriental).  Thanks to the free tram that arrives every 6 or so minutes, you can easily enjoy the amenities of the more luxurious neighbors (and charge all the MGM-owned Resorts to your room too).  It's slightly more difficult to cross the street, as it involves walking until you get to a pedestrian bridge or crosswalk.

It is not as new and shiny as its neighbors, and thus is a little worn and showing its age (peeling wallpaper, awful cracked seat coverings for the food court chairs), but I feel it is reasonably well maintained.

I've never stayed here before, so I'm not aware of how prevalent its original theme was.  Right now it comes across as generic fancy European.  The stained glass and ornate cast\/molded ceilings are nice though.

When I saw that he went to a burger joint in Vegas that was Asian fusion? I quickly bookmarked it and was already anticipating my next Vegas trip. I've been here twice since and I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite burger joints.

Not located anywhere near The Strip, but relatively close by in the neighboring city of Henderson The restaurant is tucked away in a plaza but easy to find and plenty of parking. Make sure you call in advance to see how long the wait is! I usually call and the wait time for me around dinner time is around 15 mins or so for a party of 8. The wait area is small with a few chairs. The restaurant is cute, simple, and modern. The service is quick and fast and the workers are friendly.

Since I've been here twice, I've gotten the opportunity to try many different things, especially since I shared with one of my friends!

--Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Holy Oxtail! My favorite appetizer here for sure. When you pop the yolk on the fried egg and let it drip down onto the fries, it's literally food porn. The fries are nicely fried, the oxtail is sweet yet tender, and the chili is delicious. A very savory yet sweet appetizer and I love! 5\/5

--Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Took a couple bites of this and I like it! Probably my second favorite appetizer. The pork belly was fatty and savory and together with the steamed bun, boiled egg, and the hoisin sauce made it extra yummy. 4\/5

--Hot Crab n' Creamy Cauliflower Dip: Ordered this on a whim with my friend to share and I did not like it at all. It sounded good with the artichoke and cauliflower, but the flavors were so odd. The crab was extra fishy and the lap chong did not compliment the fishiness at all. It was horrible but it wasn't delicious either. I stayed away from this. 2\/5

--Kikis Burger: This was the first burger I tried and the variety of mushrooms in this burger is what sold me. The burger was so juicy and delicious. The garlic chili aioli was a nice finishing touch to the burger as well. If you're having a hard time choosing a burger, I'd say this is a simple yet delicious burger to try. 4\/5

--Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger: I had this burger this past weekend and anything with a fried egg is already a plus in my book. After one bite, my eyes literally rolled back. It was so darn good! The fried onions, the bacon, the egg... and best of all you can really taste the quality in this burger. It was juicy and flavorful. 5\/5

Shortly after my review, I received a message from Ehren stating that they had made improvements. I'm happy to report that this is indeed the case. Granted, I don't know how much faster the food came out. For sure, it didn't take 40 minutes this time. We had a large group of Yelpers and many ordered appetizers that trickled out at various times. Also, time isn't so much an issue when you're enjoying the company of a big group. Still, I noticed little things that demonstrate their attention to detail and I could tell that they've put in the work to improve.

So how was the food? The food quality at Bachi Burger has never been a concern. On this visit, I went with the Bachi Fish. I also went all out and added their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to my order. The Bachi Fish was out of this world. Easily one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had, the cod was perfectly cooked and the flavors mingled together to create an enjoyable experience in each bite. As for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, they were good. The thing is, they might as well have been regular Chili Cheese Fries. I could definitely see there was Oxtail in it. I just wish it was more prominent.

The advantage of being in a big group is in the sampling of other people's dishes. Elnino ordered the Chili flavored Edamame and they were delicious. Someone else passed around a plate of Bachi Chili Fried Chicken. They were tender, flavorful, and came with a great dipping sauce. For me, the huge surprise was the Bachi Pickles platter that Nelson ordered. In particular, those cloves of garlic were insanely good. I'm definitely ordering that next time.

Well done Bachi Burger. You've really changed my perception of your establishment.

I'd like to think of myself as an old-fashioned burger guy or purist, meaning I like to let the burger, cheese, and ketchup do the talking.  I'm fine with lettuce, tomato, fried onions, and at times, mushrooms and bacon.  I think having too much condiments and toppings ruins or hides the real flavor of the meat and cheese.


Having said that, I didn't think I would like this place too much as other burger fusion places I have tried before were just ok, but was open to trying Bachi burger out.  I have tried several of their burgers and I must say, all are good, though I have my favorites.  My favorite is the kiki burger.  I think most of their burgers at this restaurant tend to be on the sweet side.  Initially, I didn't like this burger much because of the sweetness, but when I put the aioli sauce on it, everything just came together.   The salty taste that I like came from the aioli sauce and just brought the flavoring and ingredients all together.  This burger is what I would recommend for everyone to try first.  It is not too far off the classic ingredients of a burger, I think.  Note, I'm not going to describe the burger toppings too much, as there are better reviewers before me that have described the specifics.  You can also look up the menu at bachi burgers' website 

The second burger on my list is the banh mi burger, which has a Vietnamese flare.  Again, their sauce just brings their fusion idea all together.  Yum Yum.  I would definitely pick this if I'm not up for the kiki burger that day.

The other burgers I've tried are the Kalbi burger and Mr. Ho's burger.  These burgers are fine.  All in all, I think it just depends on what kind of fusion burger you are in the mood for during that time.  If you are wanting something with a little Vietnamese taste, go with the Banh mi burger.  If you want a hint of Korean, go with the Kalbi burger.  

Others in my party have tried the American Wagyu burger and the Ronin burger.  They liked these as well. The buns on these burgers are soft and really good.  Also, I have tried the steamed sandwiches, such as the duck and pork belly sandwiches.  These are great.

Their sausage appetizers are pretty good.  We order this for our little one all the time.  Their fries are awesome too, especially the truffle fries.   

This place definitely has a good vibe and the waiters\/waitresses are friendly.  It does get busy at times, so you may want to get their by 1130 for lunch or arrive on earlier dinner times (6??).  

Whenever I have guests from out of town and are in the mood for burgers, I definitely recommend this place.  I do give them a heads up it takes a little while for the burgers to cook, so their expectations for a little wait are set.  The good thing is that they have TVs that you can watch while you wait, if you're not chatting with your friends.  It's always tuned to the cooking or food channel, so there's a chance you will get hungrier, while you wait.  It makes the food even better when it arrives and you take your first bites.  So far, I think everyone leaves satisfied and happy like I am.",0,0,0,"""Bachi Burger""",Southeast,"""470 E Windmill Ln, Ste 100""",Las Vegas,NV,89123,36.0427979056,-115.153225035,4.0,3065,1,American (New);Bars;Beer;Wine & Spirits;Restaurants;Burgers;Food;Nightlife;Asian Fusion

Not only are the burgers really good, but the toppings and flavors are all really interesting and exotic. They have standard cheeseburgers as well, for those who don't want to branch out, but for anyone interested, they have burgers with all kinds of different Asian toppings (slaw, kimchee chi, different cheeses and bacons, lots of mushrooms, sauces, etc). Even for specialty burgers, the price is pretty good, unless you get up into the really fancy stuff (wagyu, crab, foie gras, etc). 
My husband and I went and got one 'normal' specialty burger (I can't remember the name - Ronin maybe? It's the first one on the menu) and one of the more extreme (blue & green or something like that), an order of truffle fries, and one beer. Both burgers were REALLY GOOD, but I preferred the Ronin. The bacon on the other one was just a little too overpowering for me. Truffle fries were excellent as well. The whole thing cost $40 with tip and we had plenty of leftovers (not that you could save them long - the burgers are so loaded with sauces & wet toppings that they're soggy in an hour). 
There was a decent-sized crowd in there on a Friday night, service was very prompt and friendly, and I love that it's near my neighborhood. MOST IMPORTANTLY - Bachi Burger is unlike anything else in the area! I love a great, new, unique, independent restaurant that's NOT on the strip! 
Really, the review is only 4.5 stars because of one thing - the decor\/ambiance inside the restaurant. It's kinda bland and the lights seem to be too bright, but because of everything else, I'm rounding up to 5.

From the get go, Kiki's burger has been my favorite. I mean, anything with a fried egg is going to win my heart. But, recently they have had this manga burger which is soo good. It comes with the dynamite on it, which just add soo much flavor. The fries are good. The service is good. The drinks are good. Everything is just great.

I knew I had to make a trip to out Bachi Burger the next time I was in Las Vegas when I heard about the Shogun Burger!

I could tell that this restaurant was not your ordinary burger joint after taking one glance at the menu.  This is one of the more modern restaurants that serve types of burgers you would not typically find at your local burger joint.  Bachi Burger offers various Japanese-inspired burgers, dishes, and sides. 

The SHOGUN BURGER consists of Wagyyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA#Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA).  To be honest, my first bite was a little overwhelming from all the different flavors going on, lol.  But all the flavors melded together perfectly.  The wagyu beef was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The sweetness and tender poached Asian pear.  The rich, pan seared, slice of foie gras.  All of this, drizzled in miso butter, topped with arugula, in between a home made sweet bun  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw#W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw).  Foie is already very rich to begin with, so I was not able to finish this burger in one sitting-- especially since we ordered sides as well.

I tried some of my friend's CRUSTy CRAB Burger, but the burger was too salty for my liking.  It was difficult to taste all the flavors and ingredients in the burger but it wasn't too bad.  (Crab cake burger with mango chutney and tartar sauce).  The concept of making a ""Spongebob-type"" burger is cute though.  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg#JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg).  

The SWEET POTATO FRIES were fresh, crispy, lightly salted, and served with a Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg#xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg).  If you are  afan of sweet potato fries, you will not be disappointed!

The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were delicious.  Made with fresh cut potatos, tossed in white truffle oil, parmesan reggiano, porcini cream, served with sun dried tomato aioli  (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=QgvNAbzuAF7sNnz7TpFy0g&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A).  

If I weren't so full I would have ordered a few more items on the menu that made my mouth water:  the Peking Style Duck Steamed buns, Pork Belly Steamed Buns,  and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  But that's just a few more reasons to come back!

THE GOOD: the bed in the room was comfy (it was a king), the sheets were clean and the pillows were soft. The area in the front entrance was nice looking with the statues and water.

THE BAD: everything else! The timeshare creepers who kept stopping us EVERYTIME we walked by even without me making eye contact. Just stop!

Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I guess those were not considered basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.

THE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with dark finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it.

The front desk registration staff--no common courtesies. During checkin I mentioned it was our 25th anniversary and I wanted to ensure our room would be satisfactory -- no acknowledgement--most people would say ""congratulations"".

If you want a fridge, you have to pay for it. If you want a coffee maker, tough, because you have to have a suite room. Good thing I brought a cooler. 

Their housekeeping people who answer the phone are jerks. I asked for towels, twice, and after 40 minutes they told us to ""go look for the maid"". Really? That's not our job and that's what the $87 resort fee for the weekend is supposed to cover, right? 

Also couldn't use my free buffet credit for 2 because I wouldn't put down a credit card. Why would I give my card when the room is paid in full and the breakfast credits are free? Doesn't make sense to me. We were able to go to the buffet on Saturday and pay with our debit card there. They didn't need a room number like the front desk said they would. Why couldn't we have coupons to go to the buffet? (Note, Jeff, their manager, said he will refund us for the buffet and this has yet to happen).

The staff here couldn't give a crap about the people who stay here. I'd ask for a refund if I knew I could get one. Thankfully this is the last Frozen Fury so I don't have to come out here and stay in these crappy Vegas hotels who don't give a damn about their guests being happy. 

$170 a night ...what a complete waste of money. Super disappointed.

Update: got my car back upon checkout with a huge crack in the windshield. Really hoping Valet comes through and helps me fix this damage that happened as a result of us parking there!

Update 2: I changed my rating of this place from from a 2 star to a 1 star. I just got an email from their claims department for my cracked windshield, and they are claiming that my crack is from ""extreme temperature changes"". 1. There were NO extreme temperature changes. 2. The crack is over 12 inches long. Most pressure cracks are usually less than a dollar bill in size, 3. They provided me ZERO proof of this. 4.

Last August my four girlfriends and I went on an extravagant and very memorable Vegas trip.  Our 5 day. 4 night trip was through this fantastic package deal which included day and night activities and accommodations at the Palazzo (a newer and fabulous hotel that is connected to the Venetian and I would highly recommend).  

Unfortunately, two of my girlfriends had procrastinated on booking their flights to Vegas until a few weeks before and with all of the popular airlines prices having skyrocketed, they found themselves drawn to the seemingly good deals of the underwhelming Stockton Airport's lone airline ""Allegiant"" which offers sporadic flights to Vegas for roughly $50 in planes the size of crop dusters.  The catch- they would have to stay an extra night in Vegas to catch a flight out.  In a further attempt to save money, the two lovable procrastinators decided to find a cheap hotel to rest their hungover heads in for their extra night in Vegas.....in comes the Luxor.  

My little procrastinators were pretty proud of themselves for figuring out how to save their pennies right up until the point that my non-procrastinator friend and I walked them into the Lobby and helped them settle into their evening at the hotel before thankfully taking our plane home.  The Luxor reminds me of of cheap vodka- take Svedka for example.  Sure, from the outside it looks just as good as all the other vodkas.  It's in a glass bottled (not plastic!), it seems to have it's own character and vibe going on, it's clear ...but once you open the bottle and experience what's inside you realize it's just crap and you feel like a total creep for buying into it.  That, my friends, is the  experience of staying at the Luxor.  

Once inside, you feel like you're on a ride at Disneyland as the Luxor is something of a cross between ""Mr. Toad's Wild Adventure"" and ""The Tower of Terror"".  Almost everyone staying at the Luxor is really foreign or just really trashy.  The entire decor is plastic, artificial, or falling apart.  Between the pom trees and the giant plaster of paris Sphinx in the center of the lobby, it's almost like the haggard hotel is pathetically begging you to believe, ""No this is not a shit hotel, You're in EGYPTTTTT"". 

But on to the best part....on the way up to the elevator, the elevator attendant (were I use the word creepy to describe him, it wouldn't be fitting enough.  Let's just say if he had been missing an arm and been a ghost, I would have believed it), clad in a faded, teal bellhop suit asked us which floor.  When we replied ""35"", he replied dryly, ""we've had a lot of jumpers from that floor"".  Aghast, we asked him how many people have jumped and he said, ""7 so far this summer"".  When the elevator doors opened and we saw the accommodations, we realized why.  

Not only are the rooms a shabby disgrace, (my girlfriend later confessed to me that she slept with her sweats with her hood over her head and her socks tucked into the bottom of her pants), but the pyramid shape of the building makes walking down the hall extremely dangerous as the overlook from your floor to the lobby is only about waist-high and after a night of drinking could be difficult NOT to tip over off of.  I began to wonder if those jumpers had actually meant to jump, or had simply toppled over the wall.  

In the end, my non-Luxor patron friend and I joyfully skipped off to grab our flight leaving our poor procrastinator friends to think about their folly.  We were gracious enough however to leave our laughter and ""told you so's"" until they got home.  No need to kick someone when they're down.  The moral of the story- stay away from the Luxor",9,19,3,"""Luxor Hotel and Casino Las Vegas""",The Strip,"""3900 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.0954628,-115.1758039,2.5,3621,1,Event Planning & Services;Arts & Entertainment;Resorts;Hotels;Casinos;Hotels & Travel

In case you didn't know, Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay are all MGM properties, and Mandalay Bay is the only thing they got mostly right. My stay at Luxor began around 4:00 PM Monday and after hauling our bags through the casino corridors, we arrived at a frenzied check-in line. Of course, it was an optical illusion; the line was mostly groups of families checking in at once, so it went pretty fast.

We took the Wonka-vator to the 12th floor of the pyramid, found our room, and unpacked. The room was clean, included the necessary soaps, lotions, and towels, and had a working AC. Unfortunately, the alarm clock was 20 minutes slow. For shame, Luxor!

I had great cell reception with Verizon in this hotel.

A major problem upon venturing outside the room... timeshare recruiters. These people look like casino security, but if they're not wearing a utility belt, avoid them! These people will catcall you over and ask where you're from, etc. Then all of a sudden, you're at a recruitment desk getting the scripted pitch.

Here's a hint: give them two thumbs-up and they'll leave you alone. (It tells them you've heard it already.) Honestly, just say, ""No thank you,"" and WALK if they don't let up. Yes, it's rude, but Luxor is beyond rude in the first place.

Monday I dined at the Backstage Deli which is somewhere in the southwest corner of the casino. Cobb salad: EXCELLENT.

Tuesday I purchased an all-day buffet wristband which works at Luxor ""MORE"" and Excalibur buffets. I can't say either buffet is better, but I wasn't disappointed by either.

The biggest annoyance was the early pool closing at 8:00 PM. I don't gamble, I'm white, I don't go in the sun. I want to enjoy the pool at night. What the hell? Oh, and your housekeeping\/roomservers need to be more observant because someone's leftover dishes were in my hallway for most of the day. That's sloppy.

Trust me, Luxor. I'm used to RUDE customers, but the customer service part of your hotel needs improvement. Do away with the timeshare recruiters, expand pool hours, and improve your housekeeping. I, a customer, ACTUALLY may return for next year's lodging....",3,2,1,"""Luxor Hotel and Casino Las Vegas""",The Strip,"""3900 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.0954628,-115.1758039,2.5,3621,1,Event Planning & Services;Arts & Entertainment;Resorts;Hotels;Casinos;Hotels & Travel

The price was amazing especially for a suite and at check in they gave you a booklet with tons of coupons for shows drinks and food.
The hotel had so much to do along with the casino. There were 4 different shows located in the Luxor. Which was great because while my hubby was playing in the casino I went to the Titanic & bodies exhibitions since I wasn't 21.

The Luxor doesn't really suck. But it is not necessarily the most luxor-i-ous hotel on the strip either. 
___________________________________
Here are a couple of the problems that we experienced on a recent trip:

*Thin walls. I really felt sorry for the guests situated in the adjoining  room. Don't come a knockin' if the bed is a rocking (j\/k). Seriously  you could hear  everything that went down in  the hallways and in the next room.

*Small Rooms (So much for ordering the 12 strippers). Hmm. Maybe...On second thought...

*Dirty Rooms. I may be durrttty, but my room shouldn't be dirty.

*Front Desk. I know that it's March Madness (hahaha to all you fools rocking the Indiana gear [1st round loss !!!). But 45 minute check-in?

*Confusing layout. I can see my tomb being placed here. 

*Why'd you get rid of the Japanese sushi place? That was one of the few highlights on a previous trip. 

*2 words: Carrot Top

Aria, Circus Circus, Luxor, MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Signature, Four Seasons, Bellagio, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York New York, Vdara, and the Mandarin. 13 if you count THE Hotel (really part of Mandalay) separately, like they sometimes do. Then 14 if you count CityCenter, and 15 for CityCenter Residences (timeshares) but then back to 14 because I think they don't own the Mandarin anymore. 

Anyway, a huge corporation, owning half the Strip or more. Their M-Life frequent spender card is good at all the proporties to build freebee points. 

5 of their properties are linked together on the south end of the Strip, and 3 are prominent: Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. These 3 are connected by a free tram system between them. There are also connective walkways between the three.  

Where Excalibue is more of a family place, and Mandalay Bay is a higher end, more sophsticated place, the Luxor can be described as a place for the youth set. They have exhibits like The Human Body on the mezzanine, and the sophmoric comedy of Carrot Top. 

The nightclub, lacking creative naming capabilities, or seeking a particular Westchester district of Los Angeles crowd, is called LAX. 

And in the casino, they play loud club music all over, so it is hard to hear the numbers called on the Craps table. And most of your fellow players are noobs on the gaming tables, not knowing the rules or the bets.

The rooms are average hotel rooms. The most unusual thing is of course the Pyramid Shape, the huge light beam shining into the dark nigth from the top of it, and the diagonally moving elevators. It is a clever idea, until you get inside one drunk and try to stand upright as it moves sort of sideways. 

The Egyption  themed decor great outside with the Sphinx and Obelisk, but indoors it is drab, like being inside a dustry tomb in some places (like the buffet room). The pool has a huge waterfall contraption in the middle, but you can't use it for a slide, just a small waterfall. 

So if this is your first time to Vegas, and if you are in the 21-29 age group, this isn't a bad choice. They offer cheap deals on rooms, and I got a special show rate of about $60, and in the past got internet deals under $100 a night even on a weekend. But no bath, only a shower in the Pyramid rooms.

Grafting more modern things onto the Egyptian architecture looks totally cheesy and desperate. As for the room, the AC was rattling and wheezing like an old smoker on a binge. We also had a broken hairdryer but it was promptly replaced. Our room was fine, otherwise.

Picked this hotel because we were seeing shows both there (Criss Angel Mindfreak) and next door at Mandalay Bay (Michael Jackson ONE). These hotels attach via walkway so choice to stay here was made out of convenience. Here's our experience, positives and negatives:

Positives: Friendly, helpful staff. Casino not overly crowded and smoke\/smell is less overwhelming than in other casinos visited. Minimal external noise at night in halls if you have the heater\/cooler unit on (drowns out the nonstop music from the main floor, which is otherwise faint if you don't have the unit running). 

Negatives: bathroom door paint peeling\/missing in spots, bubbling. Long hair on toilet seat upon arrival. Dirt, mold, residue along bottom of shower on the outside. No coffee maker, microwave, small fridge in room (you have to go downstairs to Starbucks or order room service for coffee in the morning if you like to have it before going anywhere for breakfast). No complimentary bottle of water, shower caps, q-tips, little things provided even in ""cheap hotels"" other than shampoo, lotion, soap. ""View of the strip"" room as told to us at checkin = view of a parking lot and freeway. View of rusted pipe and grime above the bathroom sink. No thermostat - you either want the room hot or cold, there is no middle. Bathroom fan not working. Missing drawer knobs.

Other negative: Checkout is 11am. If you ask about a late checkout like we did, you will be told that checkout at noon costs additional $15, checkout at 1pm is additional $25, etc. And, you can't checkout over the phone if you do this, you have to come down and wait in the lines that are often LONG, LONG, LONG. Makes no sense since the additional charge goes right to your credit card on the reservation anyway. We skipped the late checkout since we wanted to simply call the front desk, follow the telephonic checkout prompts and go. 

I will not return to Luxor. Staff aside, it doesn't present well. I would go back to Paris, Bellagio, and New York New York where I've had wonderful stays (lovely rooms, ordinary and\/or upgraded amenities, great staff).

At BB You can choose to eat your burgers from booths, tables, or at the sit down bar. Despite all the seats, BB does get crowded, especially during lunch, dinner, or the weekends. This place has TV screens everywhere, in every booth, along the wall at the sit down bar, and a few others placed throughout the place. It's more like a sports burger bar...I like seeing ESPN on the screens, I'm a guy, it's in my DNA! The crappy thing I don't like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. Don't expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain't the place for that.

The menu is simple. You can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. Reasonable priced menu especially for the LV Strip. You can choose from different meats...Black Angus, Country Natural, American Kobe, & Buffalo. For you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. Then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. And you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk Zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). I usually keep it simple: Kobe beef on a sesame seed bun with grilled onions & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes I did just order a $7 shake!). The wife likes the Surf & Turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. They also have a $60 Rossini Burger-kobe, foie gras, black Perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.

They also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. Beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and BB alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. We always pass on the drinks. 

For the most part we've had decent service. But we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we've had hit or miss service. It's mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. And it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance LOL! Seriously, you can hear ESPN, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that's going on all at once. BB has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.

Overall, BB is fun burger joint where you can create your ""OWN"" masterpiece of a burger. We like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on's, they can definitely add up. You could easily be eating a $20+ burger.

Me and my other friend had the black angus burgers. I asked for medium rare and it was technically cooked alright (slightly overcooked but acceptable), however, the meat had zero juice and no flavor. I had smoked gouda (one small slice) and caramelized onions on mine and the onions were the overwhelming flavor. I felt like I was eating cardboard with onions--my burger would rate a zero star.

Located along bridge between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Burger Bar has established itself over the past years as a standard in higher end gourmet burgers.

The menu here has some nice selections and variety for most who enjoy a great burger, healthy and not so healthy options are available. 

When approaching with a group make sure to grab a reservation. Most nights of the week can be busy as Mandalay Bay and Luxor are generally busy but when a convention is on it can be packed. 

My recommendation is the Spicy Lamb Burger. As lamb can be little hard to find in town, Burger Bar seems to get it right. Most the burgers will come with fries, but are able to changed out for salad if need be.

One also great aspect of Burger Bar that isn't really talked about is the Beer Menu. They carry a fair amount of local and nationally crafted beers that is rotated out month.

Went with the American Classic thinking this should be easy.  I mean, how can you mess up a burger, fries and a beer?

Ok, the Double Chocolate Stout, while not amazing, was a great way to start the meal.

I typically get my burgers medium-rare, but after the KGB fiasco (see previous review), I decided to play it safe and go for medium.  Meat was still a bit too pink for me.

I so love Hubert Keller from all the cooking shows (and actually, I rode in an elevator at Mandalay with him- but couldn't get the nerve up to say anything! DOH!). I had high expectations, and felt so let down.

We sat at the bar, as the booths and tables were all full. The service was friendly. We ordered the strawberry mojitos to start. They were not good. They tasted like cherry 7-UP and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you couldn't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry. 

We ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share, and I ordered the veggie burger. I found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger. I did try a couple, and, in the end, my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks (with no fries...those we had to pay extra for).

We chose the mozz sticks, sweet potato fries, and regular french fries for our combo. For sauces, we chose the spicy ketchup, the tartar sauce, the cinnamon sauce, the chipotle aioli....and I can't remember the other one. They weren't horrible, but none of them were special. Again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant, so I figured the sauces would be sublime. The fries were also so disappointing! Just basic, frozen fries. The sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce, and I usually don't care for sweet anything. They were the highlight.

My veggie burger sucked. For one, it was huge. Hotel rooms in Vegas typically don't have microwaves, so there is no way to reheat left-overs. I don't understand why Vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you cannot enjoy left-overs! More than half of my veggie burger was thrown away.

The burger was also mushy and tasteless. I ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons, but couldn't taste them at all. The beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever. 

My sister and her friend liked their meat burgers, so maybe it's just the veggie burger. If I ever try the place again, I'll try the vegan sandwich (with the roasted veggies) on ciabatta.",1,1,0,"""Burger Bar""",The Strip,"""3950 S Las Vegas Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.09446,-115.176113,4.0,2440,1,Bars;American (Traditional);Burgers;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife

The ""Hubert Keller"" buffalo burger came with a tasty red wine reduction sauce, but the burger already soaked through the rustic ciabatta bun and made it impossible to add without completely disintegrating the bun. The burger also came with grilled onions and cooked spinach which were flavorful, but there were too much of them. Because of the toppings, the Keller burger had nice flavors that are atypical of a burger. It reminded me of a French dip sandwich more than a burger which isn't necessarily bad.

The Keller burger was better than the ""Blackjack"" burger. The Blackjack burger was too small to fit the ciabatta bun. The key flavor of the burger was the olive tapenade and also had jack cheese. Lettuce, red onion, and sliced tomato are on the side which I added to the burger, but should I really need to assemble my own meal? A pickle is also on the side, but it's a spear, not sliced. Good luck putting that on your burger. It's questionable if the pickle was house made or bought from a purveyor.

The kitchen had trouble with their cooking temps. The medium-ordered buffalo burger was medium-rare. The rare angus burger was unevenly cooked with one-half medium-rare and some parts medium. Whatever beef blend they are using, it didn't bring out the flavor of the meat.

Although called ""skinny"" fries on the menu, they are classic-cut bistro fries, not shoestring skinny. The fries had a thick crust which reduced the inner potato fluffiness, but they were less greasy than most.

I was a bit shocked that a Hubert Keller restaurant would staff and dress their waitresses like a Hooters. The waitresses clearly don't eat the burgers here.

During a slow time of year in Vegas, the restaurant was busy and required a 10 minute wait to get a table. Even though this is a burger bar, many customers had salads for lunch.

I've become a bit of a craft beer enthusiast recently. I still don't know what I'm talking about, but I do enjoy a good brew. I noticed Ken M included Burger Bar on his ""Craft Beer Revolution"" list. I never would have thought of Burger Bar for that. I just pictured it as a place for expensive burgers. That's changed of course.

On my two recent visits, I ordered a Salmon Steak sandwich with some sprouts. At $8.50 (plus I think 55c for the sprouts), it's one of the cheapest things on the menu but I find it absolutely delicious. I get the salmon cooked medium and it comes out perfectly.

On the beer front, I went with the Deschutes Inversion IPA on my first visit and the Burger Bar Seasonal on my second. I'm a big fan of Deschutes anything. The Burger Bar Seasonal is currently a Hefeweizen by Tenaya Creek Brewery. Being a local brewery, I had to give it a try. I really need to make my way up to Tenaya Creek one of these days.

The Tuna Melt (Albacore tuna salad, Swiss & mayonnaise) was oh so good. They pack a lot of tuna in the sandwich. This is the one sandwich where I don't need extra mayo because they put the right amount in there. 

The Hawaiian BBQ (Grilled chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple & BBQ sauce) is a sweet, tangy, and tasty sandwich. I like it when BBQ sauce meets pineapple. It is one awesome combination.

I danced on the stage for like 3 minutes and all these photographers for the company party (still not sure whose party it was) took pictures.  Oops. Oh well.  At least I changed out of my company shirt with my nametag. haha.  

Place seemed ok, but it wasn't anything special.

Update 5\/1\/08

I came here with the girls last weekend on a Saturday night.  We had VIP passes that still required us to wait approximately 20-30 minutes in line.  It was so packed that guys were only allowed in if they were with a girl (one-to-one ratio).  

Tao is way too crowded and pretentious.  You get in line only to be a part of another line in a stairwell that goes all the way to the top floor called Tao Beach or something like that.  It's nice that it's out in the open so you don't get hot and sweaty, but after waiting 30 minutes outside in line and another 10 minutes in the stairwell to get outside...you just want a freakin drink!  It took us ANOTHER 30 minutes to get a drink pushing our way to the front.  After a weak drink that cost us a fortune and I finished in 1 minute, we tried to dance to the pathetic music they were playing.  Shortly after, we got ""complained"" about because we were dancing too close to a VIP table.  There were VIP tables everywhere and no where for anyone else to stand, sit, or dance.  Weak.  This pissed me off and we all decided to go downstairs to the main club area.

Surprise, surprise.  You have to wait in the stairwell again to go downstairs.  Another 10-15 minutes go by.  We see that the music is better and it's easier to get drinks, but we check out the dance floor and it's packed like sardines.  Every other section was the same.  

There was this weird open cage where a scantily clad woman was grinding on top of another woman laying on her back.  Every time I walked by they were just doing the same grinding motions over and over again.  I'm not sure how this related to the theme of the club.  I guess it didn't have to.  I didn't get the chick in a bathtub near the front door either.  

We left feeling irritated.  We would have been happier gambling at the tables.  

Please don't waste your time here.  There are better clubs\/lounges in Vegas.

When I say ""as good a time as any,"" that's both true and false. Being Saturday night on Labor Day weekend, the place was crazy packed. Fortunately, we were able to use the hotel guest line and it only took maybe 15 minutes to make it inside. Unfortunately, I had to pay the requisite insane cover charge of $40. Oh well. I justified that with the knowledge that my cousins knew some people who had a VIP lounge area with bottle service.

After we paid and went inside, we snaked our way up the stairs to the rooftop pool area. With the constant flow of people going up and down that stairwell, it felt like we were still in line for something. Seriously. We finally made it to the top and to cut a long story short, we found our group.

I must say that the VIP area really made the experience for me, at least on a night as crowded as that. I'm really not a huge club type person and it was nice to have an area that didn't feel like a zoo of people. My star rating is with that in mind. Tao is certainly a nice club.

Awesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. You can't dance if you're wedged up against 600 other sweaty, wasted people. I don't care how good you look coming in, you're gonna look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted regardless.

I can imagine if you're really tore up however, it might be a strategic move to shove your way in to the middle of the crowd, since it's virtually impossible to fall down with all those people holding you up.

Also, those girls in the pools are really depressing.

The 2nd level with the huge look around bar was decent. But you have to go all the way or around or squeeze through the crowd near the bar to get to the dance floor area. Then they have this area thats closed off and girls only apparantly: BS. 

you're lucky your drinks are somewhat cheaper than all the other nightclubs. $8 beers and $13 drinks here and there isnt bad at all. with ATB DJing that night, it def made it better. But damn, this place was so damn crowded and it was so hard to get around, it was frustrating.

We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. 
Once we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.
After having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.

We had a ""Skybox"" over looking the dance floor its was roomy enough for the 10 of us. We originally had 12 but 2 dudes dropped out, if it had been all 12 it might have been a little tight up there.

From start to finish the service was spot on. The security was security, not like others described in their reviews. They didnt mingle with our girls or flirt, they monitored our area escorted others away from our area, escorted us to the bathrooms (HUGE BONUS!!!). The servers\/hosts were very friendly, outgoing, gracious and hospitiable. The never once let our drinks go empty. The server assistant kept our are super clean the whole night. He was constantly walking by picking up our glasses wiping up ice spills, etc.

The dancers are hot, the tub girls I found to be lovely, and the music was good. From start to finish TAO was great, I'll go back in a heartbeat and do it all over again.

Cheers TAO and thanks for an awesome VIP experience it was truly appreciated",0,0,0,"""Tao Nightclub""",The Strip,"""The Venetian, 3377 S Las Vegas Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.122643,-115.170356,3.0,2094,1,Bars;Restaurants;Asian Fusion;Dance Clubs;Music Venues;Lounges;Arts & Entertainment;Nightlife

I would really give this place 2.5 stars but it was so pretty inside, I gave it 3.  If you dine at the restaurant, they will give you ahead of the line stamps so you don't have to wait in the ridiculous line.  

Why it lost stars:
The dance floor is really small and super crowded.  I wonder if they even keep track of how many people come into the club because it seemed like they packed in people 3 times the maximum capacity.  Also, the music is way too loud... it was almost like we were at a concert.  I was also turned off by the DJ.  I understand that they have to play a variety of music for the general crowd, but alternating 3 hip hop songs and then followed by 3 rock songs and then back to hip hop just breaks the rhythm up.  If they had two separate rooms playing different kinds of music, I would appreciate it more.  

All in all, I'm glad I came to this club.

The first time was a bad experience for me because of how crowded the place was, nonetheless, I gave it a second try. Well, the second time, I was there for Halloween... and let me tell you, that turned out worse. I was denied entrance: (1) I'm not Asian, (2) I was there with my boyfriend, and (3) I didn't ""look"" like my I.D. I had blond hair back then, yes, I looked different. Lets see, it's HALLOWEEN! Not only do we dress-up on this day (costume, colored-contacts, etc.) - I also have black hair now. I sure as hell am not going to update my photo every time I color my hair. WTH? Ridiculous.

If you haven't gone, you should difinitely go (at least once.) The decor has an Asian Theme to it and is very lovely. It does get croweded here but what nightclub in Vegas doesn't. I also like how there is more then one room so if you get bored of the music, you can migrate to another room. If you hang out at the Venetian, sometimes people are passing out VIP passes that admits 2 ladies in for free Fri, Sat, & Sun night. To be honest, if you know a promoter, you can put yourself and your friends on the guestlist and you all will get in for free. Even the guys. It's usually hard to get into the nightclubs for free but I find it fairly easy to get into Tao. You just have to go early (10pm) If you go later then that, the line gets really long. 
The drinks are reasonable ($12 or so)

Loved this place when I first ate here, years ago.  And, while I was in Vegas, I decided to bring the girlfriend here to check it out again.  So, we made reservations about two weeks prior.  And on a Sunday.  So, anyway, I think the reservations thing was what made me give this place four stars instead of five.

Even with reservations, we had to wait almost half an hour for a table.  Which I can understand to a point.  Now, the place was packed, but there was still a few tables for two open when we were walking by.  Not to mention, we were five minutes early.  Oh well.  Not too mad about it though.

Okay, first thing I got to say, the Kobe sashimi was awesome.  Had to try it, even though it was quite a pricey item.  Interesting, though some traditional wasabi and some of the fresh wasabi together would be divine.

For my dinner, I had the Grilled Raw Tuna.  The Asian Green Stir Fry was good, though I suppose the saltiness of it balances out the tuna.  And the peppercorn sauce just made it all mesh together nicely.  It was sweet, which accented the Tuna in a subtle way that really pulled the flavors out. 

Then the Lady had the Diver Scallops in curry sauce.  And man, those scallops were gigantic!  Buttery in the center but nicely seared outside.

Price wise it was cheaper than the other hotels on the strip.  Like the other Yelpers stated, the line to check in was soo long, I must have stood there for about 45 minutes.  

Ok, so I got a non-smoking room.  I walked into my room and it reeked of smoke.  Called the front desk and asked what kind of room was I given? It was confirmed that it was non-smoking.  I can just imagine how the smoking rooms must stink!

Walls are paper thin.  One night there was a party next door, sounded like a bachelorette party.  The following night I figured it might be somewhat less noisy, and what did I get on the other side? a couple that must have been making a porno movie.

The gentleman who checked us in was very friendly and patient. We told him we were redeeming the My Vegas Rewards. We were informed it was a long process for them to process these redemptions, but he was being very patient throughout the process. 

Went to our floor and realized we had a long walk ahead of us. These hallways are super long. 

The west wing rooms are very small, just big enough for two people max as there is only one King bed. The window is very small so not much natural light comes in during the day. There isn't much counter space in the bathroom. 

The nice thing is that everything is updated so it's very modern and there's also a TV in the bathroom mirror. 

Our room had problems though. One of the bulbs in the lamp went out. And on the morning we checked out, I plugged in the blow dryer and all of the lights in the bathroom shut off and wouldn't turn back on.

The beds at MGM are, as always, really comfy! The living space was great with a lounger sofa, coffee table, side chair, table with 2 chairs, and a wet bar with a small fridge. The washroom was massive with 2 sinks, a side shower, and a lovely whirlpool spa. The whirlpool spa was definitely a bonus after a long day of exploring the strip!

We get to the room and it is any standard motel room.  No coffee pot, fridge, minibar, ipod dock.....really a crappy tv and radio is all you offer?  The bed is super comfy, the towels are stained (yes stained!)
We went to the pool one day and by 9:30a the chairs were all taken, so we got a cabana.  Nice but not worth 400 bucks, the waiter was good though.  The floating river was filthy - empty cups, straws, bottles.  What idiot thought it was a good idea to let a lot of hos and bros trapsy around with their drinks in the water.  It wasn't all drinks either it was full of leaves and debris once around was enough thanks.  Disgusting.  
The hallways are always freezing but the hotel rooms AC doesn't work so great.  
The lions are depressing.
Apparently a very common switch is to say the main tower if full so they send you to the ""upgraded"" West Wing.  What a dump!  The elevators look like beat up old freight elevators.  The poor people on the first floor are in a hallway that leads to the elevators - I'd be pissed if I was them.  And the rooms - you can put in all the leather and all the mirrors you want it won't hide the fact that the room is soooo small the bed blocks the window.  Don't fall for the ""upgrade"".

We stayed at MGM during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, so it was way crowded.  This is to be expected.  However, what was not expected was MGM doing work on the 24 hour coffee shop, which is typically the best (and at least most reliable) place to get breakfast in a casino.  It was poor planning to have this construction going on during one of the busiest Vegas weekends.  So, that was annoying.

The rooms are solid but not spectacular.  One thing that's nice about MGM Grand is there is a broad spectrum of things to eat, from a food court to Joel Robuchon.  Craftsteak is always a winner in my experience.  You have a good amount of dining options here.

Everyone has their own taste and that's what makes Vegas so great: choices.

- Modern Style
- Great Location On-Strip
- Free Parking
- Various In-Hotel Entertainment
- Award Winning Restaurants
- Average Price
- Stay Classy

I however, prefer to stay in modern, comfortable and somewhat pricier hotels. Not because I am a snob, but because I deserve it. The MGM Grand has had many awards in the past for a reason, see for yourself: http:\/\/www.mgmgrand.com\/press_room\/press_room_awards.aspx

From dusk until dawn the MGM Grand has the ideal location on the strip, putting you within walking distance of some of the hottest clubs. If you're not much for walking, you can always hitch a cab out front. If that doesn't sounds ideal, you can always stay-in. My wife and I do all of the above on our trip to experience all that Vegas has to offer.

Sticking to the subject, MGM houses a variety of dining options such as  the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, and Emeril's New Orleans Fish House. For those on a budget the McDonalds is open for most of the day, though the lines get PACKED.

If you love Cirque du Soleil as much as I do, you'll be excited to know that MGM hosts KÀ which is a very crowd revolving movie-like experience. If you're into the clubs, ladies get in free while guys pay a small fee. Drop into Tabú ""ultra lounge"" or Studio 54 nightclub. Like most places in Vegas, the people get crazier (and more drunk) as the night goes on.

As far as the rooms go, they can be pretty tiny, although modern and comfortable. With just enough room to stick your suitcase in the bathroom shower, you'll be encouraged to stay in the Celebrity Spa Suite like my wife and I did.

The extra space of an oversized bedroom leaves room for an extended living area (that I never used) and a large dresser. This room can be great for a romantic extravaganza with it's whirlpool spa in the bathroom. Let the bubbles runneth over!

All-in-all you can stay fancy, sleep well and eat well without ever having to leave your own hotel. If you decide to leave, you are near all of the places on-strip you'd want to visit.

Upon check in after a long flight from NY, I waited in line to check in for ONE HOUR to check in. As I tried to find my room, I was tripping over children (yes, children sleeping in the floor and sitting at slots in the casino), and that was an experience. All of the elevators to get to your room are in the middle, that's right, the middle, of the casino.  

Upon entering the elevator (which anyone from the street can access as there is no security or any measures to keep people outside of the hotel from wandering around to your door), I was greeted with a stink of garbage, marijuana and old spilled beer--ugh. 

Upon entering my room, it appeared near, UNTIL I noticed something on the portrait in my room---a SEMEN STAIN from God known when.  I called
The desk, who sent me to the concierge, who did nothing. That was Sunday. 

Monday, stain still there even though cleaning person was in room (the who hotel is filthy, so who knows what's going on), so again, why she didn't see it, I don't  know. Inwas told by Hotel Manager 1 that it would be taken care of.  It wasn't.

Tuesday morning:!went to concierge who directed, and personally walked my husband and I to her.  She didn't believe us (we had photos, unfortunately) and suggested that maybe someone was paining a mounding and it dropped on the paining.  Umm, no!  She refused to take any responsibility or to make it right and said it would be taken care of immediately.  Since the room hadn't been clean yet, I figured ""okay"".  Nothing was done seven hours later. 

Tuesday afternoon, my husband went to complain (after I was left on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak to a manager) and was told it would be taken care of. 

Tuesday evening: we return from a great night and find that the stain is now smeared on the painting, but there's 8 extra towels in the bathroom.  WHAT????  I decided to go down to the front desk at 9:15 (less than an hour ago) and clear this up.  I was told by WOODY (how apropos to my situation) that he will send someone up to clean it right then (at 9:30 pm, no!). I told him of how I spent a lot money in his hotel and could have stayed somewhere else better for less: example the ""Delano""). I told him how grossed out I was and he shrugged and said he and his girlfriend where in the same position last month and they were ""powerless"" too.  First of all: I don't care; secondly: then do better than what you had.  

It left off with him saying his hotel is too large to help everyone and that he has no control over house keeping.   I suggest that Woody read the want ads to find a job where he can pass the buck and be proud of the anarchy and jungle he is helping to build.  (Hey, he may be good for the DNC---kidding, sort of). 

Anyway, the real gem was his last statement to me "" You're leaving tomorrow anyway, so what difference does it make if you stay in the room one more?"". I'm sure Hooters and Motel 6 accords the street are cleaner and run better.

I don't travel often so maybe my 5 star rating would be different than yours. The room was clean, big bathroom, somewhat comfortable bed, I had a window to look out of. I don't require a lot of perks while traveling as I'm not in the room much. 

Minibar is censored so they know when you take something out of it. I was too tired to walk down to the store one night and spent the $4.50 on a can of soda. 

My only negative was the second day the air coming in from the AC smelled like cigarette smoke. It was disgusting. 

Like everything else on the strip the food here is so expensive. And don't even think about ordering room service. $13 for oatmeal? Don't forget to read the fine print of the $4.95 service charge.

It's been just about one week since we've been back from Las Vegas, and I'm still bothered by our experience at MGM. Thankfully we only had one night there. Admittidly we booked the room to be able to use the lazy river. I wish I had known we'd be paying $30 for one drink at the bar outside. 

First, check-in was extremely long. Their mobile check in was 'down' so everyone had to wait in line. It was only 12pm, but the line wrapped back and forth a few times. When we got to the desk, there was a hard sell on an upgrade. We ended up doing it when we were told it was 'a nicer tower with a much better view, especially of the pool'. That was a total lie. We had a low floor view of the building. The rooms, and elevators, were all extremely dark.

We spent what was left of the day at the pool, and then the casino at night. We got to our room at about midnight, and went to bed. We were awoken at 2:30am by an extremely loud crash into our door. Being woken out of a dead sleep by what sounded like someone breaking into the room was not pleasant. My boyfriend looked out the peephole to see what was going on, only to see a hooker and a John fighting in the hallway. While I understand you can't control how guests act, it was how security acted that really upset me. I called security and we waited in our room for them to arrive while listening to the screaming and fighting. My boyfriend met the security guards in the hallway, and pointed them to the room a few doors down where the guy was. The woman came back at him, still screaming, while security looked on. They allowed them to continue to yell and stomp down the hallway and throw items. A few times my boyfriend asked the guard that was by our door if he could please remove them from our floor because I was still visibly bothered by the fighting, as I was trying to come down from the adrenaline rush from being woken up. Instead of separating the hooker and the John to sort out the issue, he told my boyfriend to be quiet as if he were the problem. When they eventually calmed down after about 15 minutes, security walked the female away, and the man went back to his room. When we left in the morning, they were taking off his bloodied hotel room door as he watched on.

We waited in the long check-out line to bring up the issue. They basically said 'sorry' and took off the resort fee. $35 compensation for a horrendous nights sleep. They took no responsibility for being unable or unwilling to take control of a bad situation and make their guests feel safe. We were also assured that he was removed from the property, which was a lie, seeing as we saw him twice that next morning. Once outside his room, and once in the lobby.

This review is just of the casino's staff treatment:

I was walking through the casino with my parents to get back to their sister property, the Signature. My parents stopped by one of the machines and my mom wanted to show me something. One of the employees stopped me and this I didn't mind because ,granted, I do look young for my age and do look underage compared to others. But his attitude and the way he handled the situation appalled me. He was incredibly rude towards me and was basically accusing me of underage gambling even though we were just standing by one of the machines. He didn't even ask me for ID at first. He just kept questioning me about my age and when he finally asked for my ID, he didn't do so very nicely. When he finally verified my age by slowly calculating the difference between 2017 and my birth year, he just looked angry (probably because he was so excited to try and kick someone out of the casino). All he could say was ""Oh....you look really young..."" and then tried to leave hurriedly and threw a quick and angry ""sorry about that"" before running off quickly.

Look, I get it... minors try to gamble all the time and you're just trying to do your job. But you're in the customer services industry, at least try to be friendly. I was in Vegas for two full days and I was carded at multiple other establishments, but none of the other casinos handled the situation as poorly as MGM Grand. Rather, at other casinos, I actually struck up a friendly and fun conversation with the attendants who carded me and had a lovely time speaking with them.

MGM has recently done renovations, and the rooms and hallways look great. They are very much up to ""Vegas standards"". 

However, MGM was originally opened in 1993, so some items that aren't cosmetic haven't been upgraded:

1) Such as the ventilation in the casino and rooms. MGM is very smokey and you will notice it in your hair\/clothing. Also, the AC in our room took a LONG time to cool the room down. 

2) The shower was a little wonky as well. The faucet would run while the shower was running, and the water had the potential to get extremely hot.  

PMGM is cheaper than other hotels, so it's a good choice for someone on a budget who would still like to be on the strip. 

What I did like: 

 1) Having an M Life card. It's free to sign up and allowed us to get a discount on Zumanity tickets. (The price dropped from $115 to $75\/person!) 
A lot of hotels don't offer discounts to their guests when booking through the concierge, so that was great. 
This card also gives you a discount at the small convenient store in the lobby. 

2) The pool area is very nice. There is more than one pool available and extras like a volleyball net and inner tubes are available for free. The chairs are comfortable and there are lots available. 

3) The cafeteria. Dining on a budget? McDonald's and Nathans are some of the fast food available. They also have a Starbucks in the casino. 

4) MGM is located on a busy part of the strip. There are lots of shops and other hotels to walk to from MGM.

$56 to check out @ 6pm. Room service was reasonably priced and faster service than dining in the restaurants.

Plenty of towels (ask any housekeeping member for towels when you see them walking down the halls.)

Never had any complaints, played our beats all day and night (of course we self monitored) you best believe we got rowdy with guests in and out the room 24\/7...ALL GOOD!

Upon walking up to the check-in desk, we were greeted by a friendly employee. She checked us in and even called over a manager (Jeremy DaSilva) who made sure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as quick as Andre N. and didn't think to ask for an upgrade. Luckily, we didn't really need one because our renovated room (a Grand King room) was pretty sweet. Apparently, the people of MGM have been hard at work on this renovation...and their hard work paid off.

Our room was great. Some of the highlights? Definitely the electric blinds...I love a dark room and these made everything so dark and perfect for sleeping. The bed helped too. I have serious sleeping issues and my back is always sore after sleeping in a new bed. This was not the case in the new Grand King room. The pillow-top mattress wasn't too soft or too hard and it wasn't alcohol that helped me pass out so easily. I do have to agree with Jacob H. that there wasn't quite enough water pressure in the shower, but that's not a big deal to me. My husband and I definitely took advantage of the media hub they installed that included places to charge all your electronics. What a clever idea!

The main reason I'm not bumping MGM up to five stars is because of their wifi. It really struggled to connect all weekend long and that was in both our room and the rest of the hotel. We were lucky to get one bar on our iphone and ipad. Kind of annoying...especially when you can walk into other hotels and immediately have a stronger connection. 

The best part of our stay was by far the complimentary champagne, waters, and sweets that the Director of Hotel Operations, Shadi Omeish, had sent up on Friday night. What a great welcome!

My flight was supposed to take off at 6:30 and ended up not taking off until past 7. With the pilot and the crew members, we had already been 20 minutes late. After that, they reported over the intercom that LAX had scheduled too many planes to fly in and that we would have to wait an additional time slot before we could leave.

I do like the flow of traffic at this airport-- I never seem to have a problem. However if you are coming from the 215, you have to make sure you get off on the right exit -_____-; I've missed it once and had to decided to drive around the entire airport to the street entrance, which happens to be convenient if you are coming from the strip. The drop off and pick up zone in the parking structure is a time saver! It usually takes me about 20 minutes to get from the airplane to my car. 

The security lines are efficient. I usually come an hour before boarding and I never have an issue with security. There was one time where the security line wrapped around and around like it was for Space Mountain-- but I just went to my airline counter and they were able to give me boarding pass that allowed me to go through the first class security line. Just remember a tip goes a long way in the service industry!

You can find your typical airport fare: Hudsons, Burger King, Starbucks, and a bar. If you need to head to the other terminal, you just go downstairs to the monorail. Easy peasy!

If you can find a spot, there are outlets for you to charge your devices while you wait for your flight.

You can also smoke in designated places, usually a room near the slots. The baggage claim area is huge, with perhaps 18 carousels, and large video screens and full color signs showing you all the entertainment options in town. Its quite a show right there. The taxi stand has a long line and marked pick-up stalls of at least 30. The newest major change in the past couple of years is the new off-site rental car center, where all the main companies are located about a 10 - 15 minute ride south of  the airport.

McCarran is old, ugly, and hassle-ridden, and fails miserably as the gateway to its city.

The terminal is dark and dated, looking much like that old ghetto mall in your town that everyone used to go to in the 1980s, but is now just a collection of empty storefronts and payday-loan stores. The old and inefficient design of the terminal means it's constantly crowded, from the gate seating to the trams to the restaurants and bars.

And speaking of McCarran's restaurants and bars, they mostly suck too. All airports are known for expensive retail, but most modern airports at least give you a good product for your dollar - lots of restaurant options, sports bars, maybe even a brew pub or wine bar, or a food court with some local flavor - places geared toward helping people relax and kill time while they empty their wallets. By contrast, McCarran gives you a few uninviting bars, some crappy fast food, and a couple very overcrowded restaurants - but don't worry, they've still managed to preserve the high prices you're accustomed to.

McCarran should have an inherent advantage because of its closeness to central Vegas, but this benefit is pretty much canceled out by poor logistics that make it a hassle to get in and out easily. When arriving, baggage claim is notoriously long. If you're picking up a rental car, get ready for a nice long bus trip to the rental-car mall, which is strategically located in the middle of nowhere (granted, having a centralized rental facility is a good idea, but not when it's this far offsite).

Then when you're bringing your car back, please enjoy the lack of signs directing you to the rental-car facility, which means you have to drive through the entire airport loop (past your terminal where you're eventually going) in order to see the first sign, which then directs you back out on the highway to the rental-car place several miles away. Now experience deja vu as you take the bus back into the airport loop, where there's only one dropoff spot per terminal... so if you're flying Southwest (like most Vegas patrons) you'll get deposited with your bags on the exact opposite end of the terminal from the check-in counter.

Also, most of the staff seem to have a permanent case of the Mondays.

Vegas is in desperate need of a new airport - one that's shiny and nice and much more efficient, an appropriate facility for the city it represents. It's too bad that the city couldn't get its shit together during its last 20 years as a boomtown and make this necessary capital investment.

Cramped concourses.  The last thing I want to do is smell someone else's hangover.  Turn up the air, build wider concourses, do something please! I might as well been at a street fest it was so crowded everywhere.

Eight check-ins at McCarran International Airport and I haven't reviewed this place yet... hmm, well, I like that the airport is conveniently located near the Strip, only 1 mile. It is the primary commercial airport serving the Las Vegas Valley. Passengers who fly into the city at night are greeted by a parade of lights and a fabulous view of Las Vegas. Once you see the flashy lights below as your plane begins to descend you know you're in Las Vegas and if you're just visiting this would be the start of your Vegas adventure. For the record we've only travelled here during weekends so the airport is busy. As soon as we are able to deplane we head straight to the baggage claim area. It is quite a long walk but those moving walkway (flat escalators) help. The baggage claim area is huge with plenty of carousels to claim your bags. Make sure you're at the correct carousel when waiting for your luggage(s) to arrive. This place takes you right out to the shuttle area that will take you to the rental car center (if you are renting a car for the weekend).

While I have a great time each visit to Vegas it's going home that sucks. I realize that TSA has a job to do to for all of our safety but I've had my share of pat downs going through security checks here. Now I don't travel much by plane but our last travel was the second time I got patted down in this airport. Ugh! It was a 3-digit weather weekend, I was wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Maybe next time I should just go through the metal detectors naked.

One year ago we happened to leave simultaneously with Iron Maiden's plane while on their ""The Book of Souls World Tour"". You can gamble in the airport. Rows and rows of slot machines are available to try your luck. As a matter of fact it happened just less than a month ago where there was a winner!

Despite having been to LV soooo many times for some reason I was mildly surprised to see so many slot machines inside the airport. And the brightly lit ad all over to shoot machine guns.

They get your money the moment you enter the state and they try to take your money as you leave the state.

This airport is busy - oh my God busy. It's a mini Atlanta or a mini Chicago O'Hare airport. 

Security stinks - and speaking of stinking so does the  airport like old stale cigarettes, booze, and hang overs. Back to security - there are always long lines, security is slow - there are never enough beds and they don't refill. Take some feedback TSA McCarran let's tighten it up and get it together.

The food situation is meh - lots of unhealthy, fast food crap. Not many restaurants pass a cutie which is a shame. The Wi-Fi is slow. Power outlets to charge phones are sparse. Hailing a taxi is a challenge. 

Okay so I have to say this - every airport facility needs to go visit PDX and TAKE NOTES do you see how a real city airport should be run.

However, Joe's combines the best of both worlds. Made a reservation for a Monday night while attending a conference in Vegas.  The place was crowded.  Seating in the front (outside in the Forum shops), in the middle of the restaurant with the bar, and more intimate dining in the back.  

Ordered the Caesar salad to start - nothing fancy (which is a tad ironic considering the place is located in Caesars Palace.)  Since the stone crab is so famous, also ordered some to try.  Some roasted corn on the side was a recommendation from the waiter.  And for the main course, a dry-aged bone in rib eye steak.  

The stone crab was good - not as sweet as I had imagined.  Then again, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I get spoiled by dungeness crab.  But good nevertheless.  The steak was fantastic!  Cooked perfectly.  Seasoned perfectly.   The bone-in adds so much flavor.  Superb quality.  And the corn was really delicious with a smoky, peppery flavor.    

To top off the meal, I had to try their key lime pie which someone had said they fly in from Florida.  Not having been to Florida and not sure if this rumor was true, this was still the best key lime pie I've ever tasted.

When I finally narrowed down where we would be going for my Birthday dinner, I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other Yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my Birthday. 

We took a cab to Caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the Forum Shoppes to the restaurant. We were escorted to the Host Desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. Everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly. 

Our waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. I ordered a Cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. The bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. Our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. We started with a medium order of  the Stone Crabs (less sweet than Dungeness but more meaty and tender). It came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but I asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). The cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. It was something I had never seen before and quite memorable.

We shared a chopped salad which was kindly split in the kitchen. It was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. For our mains, the Husband opted for the Beef Wellington (as rare as possible) and I ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. For sides to share, we opted for the GreenBeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of AuGratin Potatoes. My steak was beautiful. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye I have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and I have had many). The Wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. The only ""miss"" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.

I had been looking forward to the key lime pie I had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, I was a bit disappointed. I am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (I consider milk See's the fancy kind I like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. When our waiter came by, I inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if I wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). I was glad I spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal. 

Winner Winner Birthday Dinner and seriously look forward to coming back here someday.

Service (4\/5): We wanted to grab a nice meal before heading back home. Came across Joes and thought, ""why not"" since we didn't take the time to have a nice sit down meal in Vegas. The place was packed so the only available seating was located at the bar and we were seated immediately there. The service was extremely slow for our table even though other bar tables who sat and ordered after us were served their food first. Personally I didn't even notice but my friend was upset. After the waitress apologized about 3-4 times to me I realized we did wait quite a long time for our food.

Food:
Crab Bisque (4.5): We ordered a cup of the bisque to try. It had good flavor just was slightly too salty. It was served in a small bowl with some kind of veggie medley garnish. 

Wedge Salad (5\/5): The wedge salad was as good as they get. It was large enough to share between 2-3 people. The crispy pork belly was a great alternative to regular bacon. The pork belly was cut into cubes so you get thick, squarish pieces. 

Seared Sea Scallops (2\/5): It comes with 4 scallops, decent size. It is plated on mashed cauliflower with bacon jam. We were definitely anticipating this dish after ordering it but unfortunately it was a disappointment. The scallops were a little bit overcooked so they were slightly tough. And they were extremely salty. Fortunately, our server took it off our bill. 

Stone Crab (4\/5): I would say this was good crab for crab being eaten cold. We ordered the medium size which came with about 7 claws. They were pre cracked and each claw was decent size. It was served with lemon and a side of a mustard like dipping sauce. My friend and I weren't a fan of the sauce. Overall the crab was good for what is was, but I still think king crab legs, stone crab and like are better eaten hot and when sautéed in a sauce.",1,0,0,"""Joes Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab""",The Strip,"""3500 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste R-05""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1189331996,-115.173751944,4.5,2024,1,Bars;Seafood;Wine Bars;Nightlife;Steakhouses;Restaurants

The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1\/4"" and bottom 1\/4"" were cooked properly but the middle 1"" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me ""I thought you ordered it medium rare?"", I said ""I did, but this is RAW in the middle."" ""So you don't want it medium rare?"" I said, ""That isn't medium rare."" ""You sure?"" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. ""So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?"" I said ""Medium rare"" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the béarnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody.

Main reason was due to the combination of both a seafood grille and steak house! We made reservations through Open Table for 7:30 on a Thursday. And we arrived 30 minutes late, why you might ask?! Because the dam can driver dropped us off in front of Caesar's palace and Joe's is located on the other side in the mall! With extremely sore feet the staff at Joes had no problem seating our late party. 

After being seated our waiter advised of specials and what stone crabs they had available. Just like many steak houses, items are served al carte and you can order side dishes to share. I settled on a Caesar Salad, Crab Bisque, and the 1 lb. of Stone Crab claws served with the famous Joe's mustard dipping sauce. Three people in our party ordered the bone in ribeye, while the other two ordered Crab stuffed Sole and Filet Mignon. 

With glasses of vino in hand we all chatted while waiting for our food to arrive. To our surprise our wait was very short! Salads arrived 1st and shortly after all our food was being served! Caesar salad was tasty, I always love it when it's served with anchovy...adds a saltiness. My crab bisque was sweet and savory, lots of flavor but could have used a bit more crab on the top. Stone Crab stone crab... Where have you been all my life?! My brother in law and I dove in, though my belly was getting full I had to eat this sweet wonderful crab meat. The claws come cracked so after you pull a few shells away, the meat is exposed and dunk away in the mustard sauce. The sauce was tasty but I preferred the crab with a bit of lemon. The ribeye and filet eaters loved the sear on the cut and raved about not only the tenderness but also the perfect way each was cooked!

Service was wonderful. Our waiter knew his stuff and checked on us often. Lol he earned the mandatory 18% tip for our table of six! And Whoop Whoop, he brought us complimentary deserts to share since it was our 1st time!!!

Presentation wise, the food looked very good. The descriptions of the food were quite good as well. Very ""foodie"" in nature. However, where it suffered was breadth of selection and quality\/execution of food, both were VERY poor.  If you can't even do a decent biscuits and gravy at a las vegas buffet, its time to give up. 

There are actually TWO lines here, one where you wait to pay and a second one where you wait for a table. I don't know how much more inefficient it could have been.  Service was piss poor as well. We didn't get our drink orders in until AFTER our first plates of food were finished (and we had someone wait at the table to make sure to get it). The table next to us, jealous of our bottle of water asked us ""do we have to get our own water here?""

Foodwise, like I stated earlier, its all foodie sounding concepts that are presented in a hip fashion. Tastewise, it was very crappy and cooked on a mass-produced scale with seemingly no consideration to taste. I enjoyed maybe two selections, the french toast and the sliced lamb.  

Pho bar was embarrassingly bad. I'd be shocked if the stock WASN'T powdered beef stock. Smoked salmon tasted off. Chicken wings were disgusting and strange texture, Chocolate covered strawberries had a weird powder dusting which ruined the flavor. didn't even want to touch the sandwiches, pizzas or chinese food with a 10 foot pole because they just looked either dry or under the heat lamps too long.  Overly salty pastas. The list can go on and on. Also, some of the foods are hard to reach due to the low positioning of the glass shields. 

I've probably been to 80% of the Vegas buffets and this one rates very low on the scale. If you're going to go to one, do one that actually cooks their food well (like the Wynn or Bellagio).",3,0,1,"""Wicked Spoon""",The Strip,"""3708 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.109538,-115.17617,3.5,5950,1,Buffets;Breakfast & Brunch;Restaurants

On one hand, the food was pretty good. Definitely on par with the food at the M buffet. Plus, I didn't have to waste my time getting messy trying to get the crab out of the shell, because it was already done for me. Something, I haven' found at any other buffet.  Also, unlike the M, the wait to get in isn't 3 to 4 hours.

They also offer a lot of desserts that other buffets don't. Chocolate covered strawberries. Chocolate covered apples [but I wish they were caramel covered]. Crepes. Peanut butter & jelly gelato. Salted peanut gelato. Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled with pudding.  

On the other hand, the thing I hate most about this place [seems to be the  thing most people love about this place], is the fact that most dishes are served on individual plates or little pots. In most buffets, only the desserts such as cake or pie are served on individual platters. 

Why do I hate this? Simply put - I can't fit as much on my plate. When I go to buffets - my plan of action is to usually get a little bit of a lot of food to kind of feel the place out. Which is, definitely something I couldn't do here. You can only grab about 3 small plates at a time. Which means you have to get up from your table more often. I guess, this could be construed as a good thing - as it provides a little more exercise to negate some of the thousands of calories you will have consumed by the end of the meal. BUT, I like to chill at the table with whomever else I am with and enjoy my food - without having to pause the conversation to get up and get more food every five minutes. 

Lastly, I've gotten used to the free, unlimited beer\/wine\/cider offered at the M. So, I was disappointed by the fact that this buffet did not offer the same. But, that could just be me being spoiled. =p

So, like I said - definitely a love\/hate relationship. But, I think it's leaning more towards the hate side.

Alas, Wicked Spoon and I just weren't meant to be. 

Strike one : Arrived at Wicked Spoon around noon on a Monday. Did not get seated until 1:20pm which gave us less than an hour to eat before they started clearing away food.

* Very few seafood options - no crab legs. Only salmon and shrimp. Shrimp cocktail was gone before 2pm. 
* The famous Wicked fried chicken wasn't crispy and was a bit soggy. 
* No prime rib - only beef coulette which was overdone and very tough. 
* Guy at the meat station pre-sliced many of the meats which led them to be dried out
* The only time I've ever not liked bone marrow. 
* My husband who loves pasta and mac and cheese in all forms (from the Kraft microwave kind to the frou frou artisan types at fancy restaurants) barely touched the mac n cheese and pasta.

1) beet and vanilla- this dish made me fall in love with beets. It had a hint of vanilla mixed with the cold beets. It had a subtle sweet taste. 
2) salt and vinegar potatoes- they had different colored potatoes in a cute pan with a hint of vinegar and salt. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and were so cute and rustic. 
3) bone marrow with kimchi glaze- it was delicious! Loved the sweet and spicy glaze drizzled on top of the bone marrow. 
4) pistachio gelato- so my friends and I asked for all the gelato flavors and got to try most of them. My conclusion is that the pistachio flavor is the best. It was creamy and had a strong pistachio flavor. The next best flavor was the thai tea and then the cookie and cream. 
5) All their meats- omg their meats were flavorful and cooked to perfection! 
Other things I loved about this place is their freshly squeezed juices. They had orange juice and my favorite, strawberry apple and watermelon juice. You could taste all of the fruits inside the drink. They also had a really good kale salad.

We tried:
- Crispy duck with panang ($20.95) - SO GOOOOD, I'M STILL DREAMING OF IT! I adore panang curry, and it is seriously done right here! We ordered mild because my boyfriend doesn't eat spicy, but it still came out a bit spicy. But even he LOVED this. While the crispy duck was delicious, I felt it was a little bit heavy for me with all the oil\/frying. Next time, I would order this as the panang curry with beef or chicken ($10.95) and save myself the ten bucks.
- Crab Fried Rice ($12.95) - So delicious and flavorful. No skimping on crab whatsoever! Would order again forsure.
- Drunken Noodle Prawn ($22.95)- My least favorite dish of the night. I felt the large, flat noodles were bland. However, the prawn was crisp and plentiful. Instead, next time I'll try the Garlic Prawn ($21.95) instead.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable and helpful. My boyfriend and I had no idea what kind of wine we wanted (they have a HUGE selection!), but he asked us a few questions and brought us out each a glass perfectly suited to our individual tastes.

i wish to the fucking black lord that i could give negative stars... or even zero stars, but yelp forces you to give at least one, so that one star will go to #109 on the menu. the ""boat noodle soup"" that was fucking delicious... anyway... 

so while were waiting to get seated we hung out at the bar to get some refreshments. i ask the waitress what their ""thai lime drink"" was and she responds, ""it's a thai lime squeeze"". uhm okay, i understand there's a language barrier, so i ask waitress #2 and she explains to me that its kind of like a limeade except its not fresh squeezed and they use concentrate instead. im like cool, okay. we get seated a couple minutes later and waitress #2 ends up being our server and asks what we would like to drink. we order a round of waters and i ask for the thai lime drink andthis bitchhhhhh says ""oh we're actually out of that"". .......... ....... okay so uhmmm how come you didnt fucking mention that when i fucking asked you earlier what the fuck the drink was made of???!???!?!!! so then im like, okay how about thai tea? and she goes, oh were out of that too.... at this point, im trying to keep the frustration off my face and i say ""are you out of regular iced tea?"" and she says no, so im like okay thats what ill get.

they bring the drinks out and explain that their kitchen is closing in a few minutes so we need to place our orders. we order the boat noodle soup, crab fried rice, pad thai, wonton soup, crispy duck panang, crispy duck khao soi, garlic prawns, and crispy duck drunken noodles x2 (chefs recommendation btw).

as were waiting for our food we notice that the tables around us that arrived after us are starting to receive their food first... were like okay, maybe its because we had a big order, nbd. 

twenty minutes later they bring out our rice, boat noodle soup, wonton soup, pad thai, & garlic prawns. we start to eat, so far so good, delicious.

ten more minutes pass by.

then twenty.

then my boyfriend when to to go poop and when he came back he was like ""our food's still not ready?!""

finally he goes to ask our waiter...

our fucking waiter... this is what he says... ""oh i just found out our kitchen is out of duck.""

what.

what.

you're fucking joking right? 

hahahahahahhahahahaha -me at that moment.

at what point.... at what fucking point were you going to relay that message to us???? were you just going to let us sit there??? what if we had never asked about the rest of our food??? we couldn't even choose anything else off the menu because we had heen waiting so long that their fucking kitchen was closed.

clearly we were upset and we were letting them have it, and their response was ""we're so sorry, would you like a free dessert?""

hell the fuck no! why would we want dessert when we came here for dinner and obviously didn't get to eat dinner????! stupid mother fuckers.

no. no no no thats it, we've been here long enough, give us our bill.

get this guys, the bill was fucking wrong. they tried to charge us for thai tea and a coke. when the hell did we even order a coke during all of this? and why would you charge us for a thai tea that you said you're out of???!

ughhhhh im about to get an aneurysm while typing this. 

long story short, they didnt compensate us for anything and we didnt tip them shit.

We had reservations at Lotus on a Thursday at 8:00 pm.  As many Yelpers note, it's in a non-descript shopping center on East Sahara.  When we opened the door the place was jumping.  It's large, with seating throughout the restaurant.  Despite the crowd we were seated immediately, even a couple of minutes before our reservation.  A man who wasn't our server but we saw several times during the evening took our drink order.  He brought us our water as well as a bottle of wine.  The Lotus wine list isn't enormous, but it's diverse enough for the majority of wine drinkers.  There are a few options by the glass and very reasonably priced bottles.  I think I've become jaded by Strip pricing when it comes to wines by the bottle.  But, there aren't any unknown gems or incredible wines on the list, but you will likely find something you like for far less than you'd pay elsewhere.

The menu was overwhelming to us.  Daunting, even.  So, we asked our server what dishes he recommended we try on our first visit.  For appetizers, we had the crispy rice and crispy garlic black pepper chicken wings.  For the spice level on the rice, we requested a 6\/10.  When the dish arrived and we tried it, it was incredibly hot.  We should have calibrated our request for Thai cuisine, we were expecting a different level of heat to say the least.  But, the dish was fantastic, very crispy and flavorful with the cubes of sausage and green onions.  I'd order this dish again at a 6\/10, I would just prepare myself for the heat.  The garlic pepper wings were pretty standard, very crispy skin and flavorful.  But, the appetizer winner for me was the crispy rice.

For dinner, we split:  the drunken noodle sea bass, garlic prawns, crispy duck with curry cause, and a beef dish that I can't remember the name.  It had a bunch of veggies and a spicy sauce, I know that.  My favorites were, in order:  the duck, the sea bass, the prawns, the beef.  The crispy duck was tender with a very crispy skin, impressive given it was coated in sauce.  The sauce, by the way, was probably the best curry I've had.  I could come to Lotus and only get this dish and leave happy.

The sea bass had flavorful noodles along with a tender and flaky sea bass.  Excellent fish.  The fried prawns were very crispy and the garlic sauce is fantastic.  i could have used more of it.  The beef was good, but it paled in comparison to the other dishes.  

For dessert, we tried fried bananas, which were good, but not very sweet.  But, I didn't come to Lotus for the dessert, so it wasn't a huge deal that I didn't love it.

Be advised that the dishes come out very fast.  It won't take you long to have a meal.  Very glad I finally tried this Las Vegas institution and will likely be back on future trips.

The club looks like Tryst when you enter but is definitely larger and instead of the waterfall of Tryst, XS has a huge outdoor pool with casino tables. 

Some of my friends that despise cramped nightclubs will venture into this place because the pool area is very wide open and there is alot of room to move around and it is not as dark and packed. This makes it easier for them to pick up chicks.

The ladies gorgeous - but can you not all wear black dresses with no accessories? 
Guys - not as gorgeous. Except I met a football player who shall remain anonymous and we were there before Magic and there were alot of nicely-clothed men.

Gambling option in the club was cool - loved dancing in the wading area of the pool - my feet hurt! BUT the DJ - um meh. Def not the best which kinda ruins the ambiance of the club.
 I mean you charge people $$ to get in so please spend some of it on a DJ that can mix. Which is not related to my request for more hiphop. Maybe that isn't your crowd, XS. Crowd was not diverse.

The cabanas were cool, there are like three lounge couches... I dont know if I'd do that because the even the line for table reservations was monstrous.

Things to KNOW:
The chandeliers in the main dance area make it rain - Grown men will push a girl in heels for a dollar.
 
The lounge beds that sit in the pool are for everyone - so if some ass comes up to you and says you cant sit there - this is our area - they paid for the circle beds around the pool and bottle service - you do not have to move or leave.

We didn't wanna stay inside the actual club so we went out and found a spot to the side of the stage. It was PERFECT. Better to be outside because it was hot but cool breezes, it's not super crowded like inside and the view's just better. Some people were swimming\/dancing in the pool, it was nice! A lot of girls just took off their heels and stood in the pool and danced, lol. The only lame thing is that, they don't have their celeb DJ come out until like 1:30. But since we got into the club (VIP style :) at midnight, we didn't have to wait too long. In the super VIP area around the stage, you know the area that costs like 50 thousand to get, Steve Aoki was there to support Zedd! It was dope. Two super hott djs in one area!

Never seen such a brightly lit dancefloor, which is quite unnerving (the whole point of a nightclub is that it's dark so you can't see who you're dancing with, right?).

 What a poorly run bunch of security to put a damper on the night, they obviously do not want to cater to a higher clientele who were in search of a good time, just a clientele that can wait in line and have everyone in the party chip in $200 (which is a miracle in itself) and sit at their table and stare at their bottles.

My boyfriend and I went to see Skrillex on 8\/29 at XS and it was a phenomenal show. First of all, the venue is absolutely flawless. It has reserved booths, couches, tables, cabanas and a bar in the middle of the pool area. It also has a perfect-sized dance floor in front of the DJ stand. It may get a bit crowded (they do let about 11,000 people in during the course of one night 10PM-4AM) but what's the nightlife like without getting pushed and shoved once or twice ;) Be sure to get there early though, or you may be waiting in line for an extended amount of time!

The service is great from what I experienced. The staff is constantly clearing finished drinks around the club and maintaining it as much as they can. The bartenders were super good-looking and very sweet! 

The DJ before Skrillex played a good show too. I actually enjoyed when he was playing a bit more because less people were on the dance floor and my boyfriend and I got to stay upfront all night. It was amazing. Skrillex killed it, obviously, and the lights\/effects\/bass were all up to par.

He was prompt, considerate- serving the ladies first, and made jokes with us. He was personable and helped to make our experience great. 

The bread served was delightful, yet different. I was afraid to try them but each kind had good flavor, was fresh and warm and the butter with volcano salt made it that much better. When the bread was finished, we stacked our plates in the middle of the table, with butter and all. We ended up asking for more bread, but the other waitor guy (not Alex) told us to take our dirty plates back so we can reuse them. What?!

My aunt and cousin were the only ones to order an appetizer. They ordered a split salad, which consisted of 2 leaves of lettuce and 5 crutons on each plate. I am not exaggerating, it was sad.

I cant remember what kind of meat everyone ordered but everything was delicious. I had the filet, which was my favorite out of the 2 I tasted. The steak was juicy and cooked how I asked. The steak sauces were yummy, but we probably wouldnt have ordered them if we knew it was $7 for a 1\/4 cup of each one. $14 for sauce.

Other than a new steak and the apology, nothing was offered or said about the food, but we didn't ask, either.

The mac and cheese was delicous and was split between my cousin and I. The loaded baked potato was huge and also split. We had plenty of food, for sure. The sides are goid for 2 people, u less you're starving.

The wine and beer were good. Coors light had blue mountains, which my dad was happy about. My pink lemonade was pretty crappy, just minute maid. I guess I was expecting a little more high end, like fresh squeezed at least. Our waters were filled occasionally, but often left empty. We were too full for dessert but nothing on the menu sounded appealing, anyway.

Although the food was yummy, I think overall you are paying for the name of the restaurant.

The place is nice, nestled in the back of Paris. Great spot, you really feel like you have left Vegas for a minute. The decor is UK at its best, decorations and design heavily influenced by London. 

The food was AMAZING. We had the following: 
Appetizer: Chorizo stuffed Main Lobster. A small lobster tail with chorizo inside served with a sauce and root vegetables. It was VERY tasty, perfectly cooked. 

Bread plate: I can't leave this out, everyone gets one but it was very good. An assortment of different breads and butter. 

Beef Wellington (for 1) split: So, we were confused by the for 1, for 2. Basically, the for 1 is baseball sized and for 2 is softball sized. If you split it they just cut in half and serve on different plates. Its served medium rare. I usually get medium BUT this was PERFECT. Im talking total perfection. This dish was great. Totally worth the money! Its served on a little potato puree and some root veggies. 

Desert: Sticky toffee with ice cream. Pure bliss. can't go wrong here. The ice cream looked like a little stick of butter. Toffee cake was so moist. 

This was an expensive meal but WORTH every penny! Service was impeccable as there were tons and tons of people working there. Water boy. Bread person. Wine guy. Managers. Servers.

I first came here with my sister a few years back and was so in love with this place this was our destination place to celebrate my anniversary.

The one thing I have to say - is even though it's been a few years - it was exactly how I remembered it and worth at least experiencing once for sure!

Gordon Ramsay Steak is located in Paris - and reservations are definitely a must!! We got a booth upstairs which was nice because it blocked out noise and it was very cozy and comfy...

And then our waitress came to show us the different types of meats they offer and share a bit about tenderness, location of cut, etc. Very interesting! 

We ordered our own Beef Wellington which now as I think back was a mistake - we should've shared because we were SO STUFFED!!  With the delicious breads - they didn't have a lot of variety but the three they offered was AWESOME - the olive bread was our favorite but they also had a focaccio, and some cheesy roll... served with sweet cream salted butter... so hard not to dive into the bread while waiting for the beef wellingtons....

For sides we ordered the Brussels Sprouts that was cooked perfectly with fried shallots and prosciutto, along with their fingerling potatoes with truffle and Parmesan! EXCELLENT and PERFECT sides!

And the Beef Wellington?  Well it was SO delicious!! With the pastry, the tender filet - with the flavors bursting out... sigh.  I've seen on Top Chef Junior - the KIDS made this - flavored with mustard and mushrooms... the technique of searing the meat and then baking with the phyllo... and i'm sure my memory is still missed some steps but it's not easy - and it tasted so tender and flavorful!! Loved it!!

And of course - we HAD to order their sticky toffee pudding cake with butter ice cream!!  We ended up eating half and all the butter ice cream and bringing back the other half of the sticky toffee pudding cake and ate it a few days later - and it was JUST as perfect! DROOL!!!

We all asked for waters to begin with while we read the menus.  I guess that set the tone.  We received our waters and 20 minutes later finally received food menus, but nothing was offered as far as drinks.
Out of the 6 of us in our group, none were impressed.  We had heard so many great things (from TV) so maybe our expectations were a little too high?  Far be it for me to want a medium well cooked steak (yeah I know for the steak that could be seen as an insult) but that's how I like it.

I tried to make reservations online and it told me that all the time slots I selected were unavailable! I REFUSED to give up and just called directly. I ended up getting a 6:45pm reservation which is perfect! Word to the wise it's a 25$ fee for EACH person if you don't make your reservation!

Drinks were ordered on an ipad, bread was presented to us, and our orders were in quickly! Everyone was looking forward to dining here so we already knew what we wanted.

I stuck to my guns and ordered the 22oz rib-eye! Mother of GAWD was that an excellent choice! I enjoyed it far more than the wellington, which was delicious in its own right. I prefer to have a bit of fat on my steak! Adds additional flavor! The best part is the fat was nice and CRISPY! My mouth is beginning to salivate as I type this! I was given a hard time for ordering a well done steak but who cares! I don't like my food bleeding all over the plate lol... The steak was juicy and PACKED with flavor! MY GOODNESS! THE best steak I ever had!

The sides were pretty damn good as well. We ordered asparagus, mac n cheese, loaded potatoes, and a potato puree! The sides are definitely family sized and we shared amongst each other. The mac n cheese was the most memorable to me. Absolutely delicious!

My $65 rib eye was uncuttable even with the surgical knife provided. The sides were only ok (limp Brussels sprouts and sad, black fingerling potatoes), not large, not flavorful and priced too high. My companions enjoyed the boneless steaks they ordered. At $80 a pop. Maybe I caught the one pissed off cow with an especially unhappy childhood. My steak was put in a to go box and thrown away.

The absolute best thing about the evening was the toffee sauce poured over the cake table side.  Big enough for 4 to share. Bravo. Really good.

Otherwise: I had asked for a booth on the second floor in my reservation (which to their credit, I got) which wasn't ready when I arrived 5 minutes past my reservation. It was supposed to be quieter there; it wasn't.

I've been to expensive places and been glad to drop the cash. Joël Robuchon's at MGM was $800 for dinner for 2 with a glass of champagne. Great meal. Smiled for two days after.

With so many options in LV, we were looking forward to some amazing food and a great time.  For the most part we were not disappointed, until we went to Gordon Ramsay Steak on our last evening in town.

We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes prior to our 9pm reservation (which we had made 2 months in advance).  The hostess didn't bother to look up from her book when we checked in with her.  She rudely pointed out that we were early and that we'd be seated at our reservation time.  We proceeded to the bar where we had a few beers.  Our bartender was very warm and attentive (the only good part of the visit).  While at the bar we watched many couples\/groups come in after us that were seated after a minimal wait.  At 9:30 I checked in with the hostess again.  She once again did not look up from her book and simply told me we'd be seated once our table was ready.  At 9:45 we had still not been seated (again, our reservation was for 9pm).  I can certainly understand a wait at a restaurant, but I didn't appreciate that everyone around us was being seated and we were not.  We asked the bartender to close our tab and we were prepared to leave.  However, she went and spoke to the hostess and all of a sudden our table was ready.  We contemplated leaving anyway, but decided to stay.  We were seated upstairs and, to my surprise, there were many empty tables.  

Once seated it took our server another 20 minutes to show up.  Before placing our order my husband mentioned having a food allergy.  To be clear, he never asks for a plate to be modified, he simply asks if the dish he is ordering is safe for him to eat, so that otherwise he can order something else.  The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to deal with this.

At the end of the day my husband had a filet and i had the short ribs.  My husband was impressed with his meal, but my short ribs were very gristly.  Unfortunately though, it really wouldn't have mattered if the food had been mind-blowing.  Poor service is just unacceptable to me, especially at an expensive restaurant.  We just wanted to get out of there, so we finished our meals and left, no dessert.

We had been so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak, I wish it had been different.  We were treated like we should have been grateful to eat there.  We will not be going back.

The fiance ordered an oreo shake, which was yummy. We ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but not the best I'd ever had. The blend of cheeses was nice and creamy, with a little sharpness, and the truffles really added to the dish. The lobster in the mac n cheese, however, did not taste like it was very high quality.

The fiance ordered the duck duck goose burger, which neither of us were very impressed with. He ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were awful and completely inedible. They were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them.

I ordered the gold standard burger, which was honestly the saving grace of this restaurant. It was the best burger I've had in my life, and despite all the other problems we had with the food here, I would definitely go back for that burger. I ordered a side of duck fat fries.

Up: Yay popcorn. This stuff is like crack.
Down: Waiter comes to table. He's looking a bit distracted ""Hi I'm ---. I'll be back in a second"" - disappears for a few.
Up: Waiter comes back. Gets our orders. We get water. Yay!
Up: Our milkshake comes out with a GIANT ice cream cookie on top. The milkshake is delicious although I wish the cookie was warmer\/softer.
Up: Our food comes out! Look at those beautiful burgers!
Down: Where our the onion rings that we got instead of fries?
Down: Poutine - overrated. Not enough curds. Skip the extra egg.
Up: Our friend's burger was cooked perfectly medium - pink in the middle and according to her, very juicy.
Down: Our burger, also ordered medium, was cooked to well down with zero signs of pink. Since we were on a time crunch to catch a show, we didn't want to bother trying to find our waiter and send this puppy back. But it was dry dry dry. The saving grace was that we added an egg which helped to moisten the patty.
Down: Bill comes out and the beer is a different price than what was on the menu. Not the waiter's fault since some of the 'old' menus with the 'old' prices were mixed in with the 'new' menus. Minor quibble but at this point, we were a tad annoyed with all the mix ups.

A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses.

Dragon Fruit Drink - $10
Black and White Shake - $8
Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9
Truffle Lobster $16.50
Pizza Twinkies $12
Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9

The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. 
The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  

The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack.

First of all, this place is REALLY LOUD. So be warned that if you are going there to converse with others...I wouldn't suggest coming here. Don't get me wrong, I love that the DJ had tons of enthusiasm but the volume of the music was just too loud. 

Our server was Jonathan, who seemed to be a really cool guy when he first introduced us. I personally felt really rushed to order our drinks. This is where the first problem arose...we wanted a plain vanilla milkshake and his snarky response was that ""all the shakes have vanilla"" so after we place our order for an oreo milkshake, we see on the menu that they have plain vanilla, chocolate, and other standard flavors. When we saw this we obviously confronted us and told him we just wanted the vanilla. He said that ""the order was already placed and as he was bringing us our other drinks he was literally blending it"" I'm not sure about you folks but when you are in the food and beverage industry, shouldn't you be attentive to the customers needs? Not sure if he was purposely trying to get a higher check average since the standard milkshakes were $3 less but anyways. I thought this was extremely rude of him to say that the milkshake was already being blended so we couldn't change our order when he wouldn't let us order what we wanted in the first place. The milkshake was yummy, but the principle.

When we asked about other menu alternatives he laughed and said ""you know this is a burger place right?"" Well excuse me...but if I remember correctly the right side of the menu had quesadillas, tacos, and a variety of other things. Who would have known it was such a crime to ask such a question.

Another thing that really tickled me was that during the meal, the fire alarm went off and NOBODY was evacuating. Yes, we probably should have taken it a little more seriously and at least gotten up to check what was going on but is it just me or is it illegal for them to not even make an effort to evacuate us while a fire alarm is going off?

We ordered the chicken wings to start and I had the Longhorn burger  for my main; and although it was extremely tasty, I didn't think it was anything to write home about (except the steak fries, yum) Ultimately, I would have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that the service here is extremely slow, with just average food.

As a vegetarian (I eat some fish) I had studied the menu ahead of time to make sure there was enough food for me to eat. I was beyond excited to try the birthday shake and was not disappointed one bit, it was the perfect shake\/cake combo! WOW! My friends tried the peppermint and chocolate banana shakes also and they were all fantastic. I'm not sure there is much booze actually in them but I really wanted it more for the shake factor!

We ordered some appetizers, I had both the lobster truffle mac and cheese and the calamari, both were excellent. The mac and cheese was amazing, I could have easily ordered that for dinner and been satisfied. 

After the appetizers I should have called it quits (I was full enough and extremely satisfied) but I decided to order the vegan burger and shoestring fries, the vegan burger was good, piles of avocado on top which I love but the patty wasn't anything special. I've had better vegan patties.....the avocado though was AWESOME. The fries were cooked perfectly also. 

My boyfriend and mom both had the surf n turf sliders, I did not try these but both of them said they are well worth the price tag.....

Read so many outstanding reviews, but maybe they were just having a bad day. Still a great outstanding restaurant shouldn't have bad days they should be consistent considering these reviews. 

Well here's my opinion...I ordered the big fat Greek which consisted of course of the lamb burger, feta cheese, thaziki sauce, and lettuce. First let's start off with the lamb cooked medium rare please as i stated to the waiter. The waiter had informed me the cook did not like cooking it that way so I said ok medium. No biggie as long as I had the beautiful pinkness in the middle. So as I got my burger it was cooked to well done!!! Wtf. The feta cheese and sauce tasted weird.  The bun tasted cardboardish. Ewww! The waiter came back and saw how my burger was cooked he was nice enough to apologize and explained to me how the chef really does not like to undercook the lamb. Um ok opposed to overcooking the crap out of it. What a damn shame!! Worst lamb burger. I had a better tasting lamb at mad Greek. Lol! But this does not even hold a candle to black hog in Los Angeles. Best lamb burger by far there. So let's continue I ordered my side of shoestring fries. It came in a cute mini silver looking pail\/bucket. So gross it was so freaking hard. And you know when you eat hard crunchy salty potatoes it kind of leaves the upper roof of your mouth raw and beat up.

I know I wasn't the only one complaining about my meal, bc the girls at the next table complained to our waiter that their burger was burnt!!! Really people!? Please reevaluate this chef dude and figure out why he is overcooking the meat and the fries. Yucky!!! 

Now about the service the waiter was nice but didn't refill our drinks once... And the tables around us were complaining asking where's our waiter. It wasn't even crazy busy either. It died down in the middle of our meal. 

Wow. Now thinking about this review three stars is way too generous. Well I will leave it to three stars due to the awesome artsy stuff on the walls. Love the decor and interior design. That part was dope. If it was based only on food and service alone 2 stars. Step up your game HOLSTEINS!

It was a Monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. We chose to sit in the lounge and I was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.

We started with a Drunken Monkey and a Black Cow. My bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the Monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. I doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. Both shakes were really delicious, and my Black Cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because I could taste cherry pretty well. The menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, I think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.

We also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or fried pickles, but we can get those everywhere in Florida, so we went with what would be more unique. They were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.

Burger-wise, I had the Rising Sun and the bf had the Gold Standard, both cooked medium. The Rising Sun did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). The avocado was a little unwieldy, and I would have preferred a few thin slices. I didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but I guess I get the appeal.  The Gold Standard was almost completely devoured by the time I got a bite, so I guess he enjoyed it. Both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, I couldn't stop eating either of them. Super crispy and delicious.

I can't think of any reason to give Holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the Strip) and the fact that there isn't one in Orlando.",2,0,3,"""Holsteins Shakes and Buns""",The Strip,"""3708 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.109842,-115.174603,4.0,2771,1,American (Traditional);Burgers;Bars;Restaurants;Nightlife;American (New)

A short way into our burgers (Longhorn burger for me with brisket, cole slaw and pickles; a mushroom and gruyere burger for David) we said, wow, these are possibly better than any place except Umami burger. As the meal went on, we decided Holsteins was giving even the venerable Umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money. It was that good. I got the Longhorn burger because I love BBQ, even though I thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly. It wasn't. The brisket was sliced thin, and was a bit crisp - almost like a super delicious bacon. And best of all, the BBQ sauce was not cloyingly sweet. A minor criticism, I thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant - maybe the quantities need adjusting. David was similarly pleased with his burger, every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms. One of us got fries and the other onion rings, both were good.

The first time, the server was extremely nice. She offered to let me try a sample of a 3-flavor shake to see if I'd like it--I did. The combination of chocolate, caramel and strawberry was delicious, if a bit too sweet (but what can you expect when there's caramel involved?). The ice cream shake melted extremely fast though, which was its only detraction.

The second day, I ordered a chocolate\/strawberry shake and a shroom burger. The server got my shake order wrong (strawberry only), which was disappointing since chocolate is my drug of choice. The burger was tasty, if not a bit too cheesy (shocking, but true). If the cheese was milder in flavor, it might not have been too much, but the pungent taste was overpowering, and I actually like strong cheese. The melty cheese was also stuffed inside a deep-fried breaded mushroom, so it was a bit dangerous to bite into without getting splattered or burned.

This burger joint first started in New York in 2004, and spread to other East coast locations, and I was happy to find out they recently started opening on the West coast. Unfortunately, the only locations they have in California are all in SoCal. When they will open one in the Bay Area? I hope they open one in San Francisco someday. But as for right now, I will have to stop by when visiting LA. When looking for places to eat, I was ecstatic to see a Shake Shack on the Vegas Strip! It's near the NY NY hotel.

I came here around early lunch, and there was already a long line near the door, and tables were almost occupied. I ordered the Shackburger which is the standard cheeseburger, and as simple as it sounded, it was quite a delicious burger! This is not the typical burger you get from In N Out (sorry if you're a fan) but the burger had a thicker, juicier meat. I also tried their crinkle fries drizzled in cheese, and the regular kind. But for future visits, I'll stick to good ol' regular fries.

For dessert, I settled for the Shake Attack which is a chocolate custard ice cream with chocolate and cookie dough chunks. Which was a great, sweet treat, which was the perfect end to my meal.

(free refill on my lemonade!)

my main reason i wont be coming back to this location is the parking policy started in april 2016.  if you drove in, you have an hour of free parking--after that, it's $7 additional for whatever food you are trying to spend money on at the MGM hotels. now, for any food place, there's going to be a line or wait. the line at the shack shake takes at least 10-15 minutes. i found myself trying to nudge people along in the line--and the cashier's are not arrayed in a clearly visible manner off the main queue. it must be so frustrating for them to keep waving at distracted orderers. it's a lot of pressure to wait 15 minutes in line, then another 10-20 minutes for the food--and shake shack is about the farthest distance from the parking garage that could be imagined.  i ended up feeling like i had ran a sprint, waited, ate like crazy, and sprinted back to the car.  

i do admire that the employees there are fairly productive but quite nice to the customers. there was one annoying customer that kept asking for additional thing after her burger arrived--she had misunderstood that the regular burger (even though it says on the menu clearly) does not come with toppings. but the food distributor lady was very polite, even after several requests by the lady for this, that, then the other. she has quite the patience.

shake shack is solid. the employees work hard. but for the price and all the competition out there, it's not worth the stress of trying to complete a nice dining experience in under 60 minutes, esp with the parking garage a full 5 minute sprint away. i'll save my shake shack visits for other cities and, in las vegas, i'll stick with a place with free parking or 1.5 hours of validated parking...",1,0,0,"""Shake Shack""",The Strip,"""3790 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1030612595,-115.173450261,4.0,2549,1,Burgers;American (New);Restaurants

So, you can only imagine how happy I was to find out that there was one in Las Vegas (not having to pay for a flight to NYC to try this out). 

To be fair, since I've had In N' Out and Five Guys, I ordered the following to compare:

Double Shack Burger; good, juicy patties, seasoned well, unfortunately someone had a heavy hand on the seasoning this night as the flavor kept going, as in, it turned out to be salty. Otherwise, it would've been a great burger, even though it is a bit on the small side (especially for the price tab)

Cheese fries; crinkle cut with a cheese sauce. My favorite part of the meal.

Second, the shop is cool. It's more modern than a typical fast food burger, and it has a good amount of outdoor seating. The patio part is strip-side, so you can check out the goings on on LV blvd, but it's still kinda private, tucked away behind some bushes.

Third, they have a good selection of beer, including one from Brooklyn Brewery made specifically for Shake Shack (even though I didn't particularly love that one).

There was a long line. It did move at a good pace though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My food was out in no time.

I ordered the ShackBurger and Cheese Fries. The burger comes topped with cheese, lettuce and ShackSauce. I opted for no tomato. The burger was juicy and tasty. The bun was solid as well. The sauce is a nice complimentary flavor. The single is more than enough burger.

The cheese fries come topped with a mix American and cheddar cheese as a sauce. The fries are good. The cheese was very good.

So the food, I ordered the, Ionno, I forgot but it was like a double burger w\/ bacon and a side of cheese fries and a drink. This order ran close to $17?

The cheese fries.. That's all it was, a piece of cheese on top of some crinkle cut fries. Pretty weak. And to add more hate how can you mess up a medium soda? It was bland and watered down.

But back to this place. Was super excited to check it out. I'm well aware of the hype and tried to make it here for a couple trips to Vegas. I walked over from cosmopolitan.  It was about a 15 min walk cutting thru some other hotels. The street may have been quicker, it was cold outside. I opted for secondhand cigarette smoke. I was thrown off by their burger logo outside.  The signage is all green. Then you walk in and see the signage inside features the green burger.  I waited in the quickly moving line but with anxiety. When it was my turn to order I had to ask, ""are the burgers green?""  I got a look back like I was being a smart-ass, but it was a legit concern in my mind. 

Back to the review. I ordered a cheeseburger , fries and a soda.  There were other options, but that's what I was feeling.  The wait was standard, 5 min'ish. The fries are crinkled fries. Reminded me of the frozen type mom would buy from grocery store.  Not a big deal to me as I'm not a big fry-guy any ways. The burger was really good. Had little tomatoes on them and some type of secret sauce.  It reminded me (taste and texture) of a Wendy's burger, but several notches higher in quality.  

It was a really good burger.  In and out is better, but this place is a lot quicker than any in-and-out.",3,2,5,"""Shake Shack""",The Strip,"""3790 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1030612595,-115.173450261,4.0,2549,1,Burgers;American (New);Restaurants

I was afraid the hype would skew my senses and I would be disappointed because of the unbelievably high bar my mind was placing on this burger. It didn't. The hype is real.

Simple foods, like burgers, pizza's, hotdog's, that require such few ingredients, mean that those ingredients play huge rolls individually. Shake Shack proves that. They use a brioche bun (vs a cheap run of the mill bun), roma tomatoes (vs regular), green leaf lettuce (vs iceberg). They're serious about hitting all the right notes.

It's simply a great burger. 

For me, for several reasons, it's not fair to compare this to In-N-Out. Sure, they're both burgers, but that's where the similarities end. I'm no fan of In-N-Out. I can write a book on the subject. This is far better, no competition, however, for the simple fact that this burger is roughly 30-50% more expensive, it's not comparable.

They're kind of pricey, especially considering how small their burgers are. That's the only negative that comes to mind.

Get the SmokeShack. Get two.

With the incredible food scene in LV, I question why I always want to go there and the answer is the shroom burger, fries and purple cow float. I swear I'm not 10 years old . But seriously, I've never had a better burger! Consistently crispy with the perfect ratio of cheese stuffed into the portobello. Fries are great, piping hot with the perfect amount of salt and I hate salt so I would know. Their self serving condiment area is wonderful so no one can judge the amount of mayo I take. The purple cow float is great, I've been there with several different people and it's not something everyone seems to love, but I really do. 

Opportunities for improvement are the water dispenser at the condiment bar. The water is always lukewarm, which is annoying when you're there in the spring\/summer\/fall. The bathroom could use more tidying up. It's a small space so filth anywhere doesn't do it any justice. It's always littered with paper towels.

Located in Cesar's palace hotel.

To start off, the wait time wasn't too bad. Lines are extremely long but they move quickly. You pay up front and its all you can eat. It was about $50ish dollars per person. Also, there is a photographer while you wait in line, and the picture is $20 a pop for 1 large and 2 small included in a small paper frame folding thing.

There is everything here! Seafood, asian food, soups, meats, drinks, and the finest desserts. 
They have crab legs, sushi,mashed potatoes, creamy soups, even dim sum omg. What don't they have really? Come here hungry, and try everything. 

The desserts are what really make this buffet stand out. They have neatly crafted carrot cupcakes, macarons (which are expensive!), and melt-in-your-mouth cakepops,etc!

Think of this buffet like a high school cafeteria. It will be long lines for all the rows of food on display. You grab a plate, and you get in line, pick and choose. Everything is neatly labeled to know what it is. 

The staff is attentive and friendly.

I take one star off because there is no menu for regular drinks so you just have to guess what you want, or ask the waiter at the top of their head.

The buffet was for two people at the price of $83 and some change. There is such variety when first stepping into the buffet. There are sections into seafood, american, mexican, italian, chinese\/japanese, and dessert. They have charcuterie with a selection of cheeses as well as a salad section. They offer all you can drink beer and mimosas for $22 (each)

The buffet highlight for me was the fresh juices and dessert. The food was good, I rather settle for a buffet a boulder station for cheaper, than to go here again. The food here was a little bland and I didn't really enjoy most of it. They do have a tapas style going for some of the food selections so you can try most of the items they have to offer, but it was missing something -flavor. I decided to try this place out due to the numerous reviews on how great this place is, I would recommend it for you to try it at least once (the seafood was awesome).

- Price varies. Lunch is around $40 and dinner is roughly $50 per person. They also mark up the prices on long weekends.
- This place has great variety. Entrees include seafood, prime rib, lamb, tater tots, tacos, dim sum, sushi, burgers, and many other dishes. Dessert menu is also extensive so I won't go into that.
- The quality of the buffet is probably one of the better buffets that I've been to in Vegas. I was satisfied with majority of the dishes with the exception of the seafood. The king crab tasted like the ocean and the oysters were not fresh. The meat (prime rib, lamb, etc) by the carving station is also a hit or miss. If you get there when they have a fresh batch, the meat is amazing! However, there are times when the meats been there for a period of time and becomes dry. (Wait until they bring out new stuff!) As odd as it sounds, the tacos are my favorite at Bacchanal! Everything is made on the spot! I always order the pork with guac, cilantro, green sauce, onions, and a squeeze of lime to top it off! 

Ambiance\/Location
- Located at Caesar's Palace
- Place is upscale and modern. Casual environment with people of all ages.

Service
- Been here many times and never had any issues with their service. 
- Be sure to tip waiters\/waitresses for their hard work!

Recommendation
- The wait can be dreadful so avoid coming at peak hours to avoid long lines.
- $10-15 cheaper during lunch time and weekdays.
- Great gelato selection!

2. We came in a group of 6 + 1 baby.  When we got to the cashiers, we told her that we had that many in our party and she told us that they only have seats for groups of 5 or less.  What?!

When we got to the end of the line for seating, we saw TWO groups of more than 7 people (who were in line WAY behind us) go in together!  When I asked the host why we were told they didn't have tables for 6 or more, she told me we asked to split up!  And that if we really wanted to, we could've pretty much begged the cashier to put us together, but our wait would be much longer.  WHAT?!

I came the week between Christmas and NYE.  At around 6, the line was about 3.5 hrs long.  We paid $20 each for the express pass which shortened the wait to only 20 minutes.

I was pissed off the entire dinner because of the food lines and took more food than I can eat because I didn't want to wait in the line again.    

Bacchanal needs better food station management.  The seafood and meat stations always have long lines which block people from getting the other dishes besides the crab legs and the carving station.

Prior to our trip, we researched all the different places we wanted to try during our trip and this place was at the VERY top of our list. 

Bacchanal buffet is located inside Caesar's palace and it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. Not to mention one of the most popular. If you don't get there early enough, you will wait over 200 minutes or pay an expensive fee to ""skip the line"".

We arrived at 4 for dinner. Dinner is served between 3-10 I believe and from what the cashier said, the busiest times were between 6-9. Boy was she wrong. Upon arriving, we checked into the kiosk to get a place in line and the kiosk gave us a return time of 219 minutes.. around 7:30. It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. 

Because this was a new experience for us, we said eff-it, and paid the express fee. For my hubby and I, our total tab to enter was $227. $69 per person for dinner and $35 per person to skip the line. After paying, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Our hostess walked us to our table but unlike the other guests, she did not explain the different buffet sections. So, shame on her. 

Upon sitting down, we wait quite a while to get drinks ordered. We did not have a specific waiter assigned to us really. It was really chaotic and unorganized where we sat. We were seated in the Asian\/Italian section at the back of the restaurant which is a VERY good section to be in. The steamed crabs is in that section and if you've ever been to bacchanal, you'll know that the cold seafood section at the front of the restaurant is the most packed section. So having the steamed crabs by our table was great! No wait time. 

My favorites from this buffet would have to be:
-the steam crabs
-the Asian soup section 
-the roasted duck
-the roasted pork belly
-the desert and fruit section
-and somewhat the meat section (steaks & ribs)

Other than that, everything else is pretty mediocre. 
Do I think it's worth $227? For first time, sure. After this? Heck no. Will I be back? Maybe. For everything I enjoyed here, I could've easily gotten anywhere else on the strip. 

Really wanted to be amazed of this place, but in reality, it was a hyped up place for me and was nothing but hype.",0,0,0,"""Bacchanal Buffet""",The Strip,"""3570 S Las Vegas Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.116113,-115.176222,4.0,7009,1,Sandwiches;Buffets;Restaurants;Breakfast & Brunch;Food

I got to try the Vegas location a few weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed. I came out of the restaurant thinking, ""so what is supposed to be so great about this place...?""
I was pretty bummed out because I came in thinking I would have the best tacos in my life that day, but it didn't even do half as good as the taco trucks I've been to. Oh and random, but they make their own tortilla!

Most tacos are $2.10. The ones I got were $2.10 each. 

1. Carne asada - it was too hard and cooked too much. It was not worth waiting 45 minutes for just the asada.

2. Al pastor - DO NOT GET. It was super salty, wayyyyy too salty. Pretty sweet too. I was shocked. Even with the pineapple, it was pretty bad. 

The tacos have too many things going on with it. They put a bit too much guac that I barley tasted the meat. I'm not sure if they just put really little of the other hot sauces, but I barely tasted those. They scooped way too much guac. It was too much.

The meats here are delicious and watching the cooks work their stations here is nothing short of impressive.  They are so freakin' fast! The food is really why you are here, and it doesn't disappoint.

The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try. 

The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada.

I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but Tacos El Gordo has changed my mind about it. Definitely get the pineapple on your tacos.

You have to wait in three different lines depending on which meats you want. By the time you get your food from one line and have to order in the other your food is cold.  Then you still have to wait in another line to pay. Second, they use chuck steak!  A carne asada taco consists of flap skirt\/Ranchera meat.  Third, the al pastor tasted like a piece of sweet thanksgiving ham and they smothered it with a green moco looking sauce. Fourth, the lengua was kept in a boiling pot of lard.  Lengua is boiled then kept steamed, not kept warm in lard.  The tripas tasted like they were not clean and when I asked if they were crispy he said, ""yes"", but were soggy.  The cabeza was also kept in the lard to keep warm.  I know mexican and this was not!

That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.

I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each. 

Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds true here. The place is very clean.

Easily one of the most amazing words in the world to say when drunk, it turns out it may also be the single most delicious thing one can eat while drunk, though there is competition*

Additionally, while my bubby would be heartbroken to hear this, I have to say that this place serves what is hands-down the best tongue I've ever had in my life. Ever. Though you'd better not be shy about what you're ordering, because saying ""lengua"" to the counterman means he's about to pull out the entire grass-licker of a cow and chop it apart in front of you.

I ate in stunned silence soaking in the mix of favors, aromas, sights and sounds.  This is yet another example of the inescapable rule - if you see all of God's children flocking into a restaurant indifferent of race or socioeconomic class - go in, take it in and EAT WITH THEM - the world would be a better place!  This place is incredible... The taco standard hence forth!

The only thing that would make this more authentic would be to move all to Cabo and put in on wagon behind a truck!  

Ok... So down to the glorious details...

When you first walk in you see that you can order various item at different stations from around counter, but if you're a newbie have no fear, just ask someone and they'll be super happy to yell to the right part of the kitchen with what you want.  After your attention is averted from the large menu (not that there's a lot on it... It's just huge!), you notice 2 massive rotisseries with layer upon layer seasoned pork, Al Pastor topped with a signature pineapple.  Much like Gyros or Shawarma, Al Pastor, the Mexican version of the same is serious indicator of being in place that cherishes flavor and authenticity.  Unlike the other two meats, how Al Pastor is seasoned varies widely based on he tradition and locality of those making it... Which always makes it somewhat of an anticipated reveal!  This al pastor was highlighted with a very mild version of its common seasoning namely Guajillo, ancho, cumin, garlic onion, and pineapple allowing the charred meat shine through a bit more on its own.  Seared in the traditional manner with cilantro and onions on soft FRESHLY MADE corn tortilla only made it that much better!  The carne asada tacos were even better which was honestly hard to believe even possible!  The lightly seasoned and thinly sliced steaks are flash grilled over a fire that defies the term HOT to be then placed in a warming container next to the girl where magic clearly happens here.  The steaks, being close to the grill, continue to slow cook and steep in the smoky sooty goodness from the grill making hands down THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!

Check out my pics ...  The tacos are generous and juicy.  Tortillas are all freshly made.

The suite also had 3 zones so that you could control the temperature (living room, dining room, and bedroom).  Overall a very nicely modern decorated room but there were a few things which resulted in some deductions of stars.  For example, the barstools had plastic seats rather than some sort of microsuede (to match the couch and dining room chairs).  A major deduction was because of the bed.  The mattress was not very comfortable (a bit too soft for me) and already showed signs of wear.  The left side was saggy and I literally sank down into it once I laid down.  Roll over to the right and you'll notice that all previous guests slept on the left side.  Kinda disappointing for a hotel that is less than a 2 years old.

I have to say - they were absolutely exquisite! From the beautiful casino floor, helpful staff, great policies and breathtaking suites, I was beyond floored with my visit to this new Vegas establishment. Let me paint a picture for you....

We wanted to get married in a fun place for our quests to take a mini-vacay. The problem with doing this in Vegas (esp on the Strip) is that things get incredibly expensive. A simple dinner meal for a catered party will easily reach $150 per head. Being in the wedding industry for the last 5 years - I decided to do some researching for alternative location spots. 

After researching for weeks, I decided to start looking in to elegant suites in hotels. Upon doing so I uncovered that it is not permitted to bring in your own food or drink to your hotel. A lot of places have extremely hard policies on this. Hotels make a ton of cash on catering. A bowl of chips and salsa would run you $5 at the store - go through hotel catering - easy $75. Ridiculous. We called at least 15 hotels to inquire about their policies. 

As a last resort we researched ARIA. Here I was thinking that we wouldn't be able to swing a luxury suite at this brand new hotel and BAM - they had a suite that was PERFECT for our needs. We had about 65 people at our wedding and wanted to throw a cocktail party afterwards. We confirmed with guest services that we were permitted to bring our own food\/drink 3 different times. Each time, no hassle. We told them we were having a party - no hassle. This suite was RIDICULOUS. Floor to ceiling panoramic views, remote controlled curtains, temperature, sound system, a giant boardroom with 12 chairs and a large table (perfect for buffet style snacking) and 3 separate bar areas for set up. 

We worked out a great deal with a local restaurant and they were able to deliver directly to our suite and set up with no problems at all. The night went off without a hitch. Even the bell hop unloaded our entire SUV filled with decorations, liquor, beer, etc and brought it all up to the room for us. I will absolutely come back to ARIA. 

Do yourself a favor, throw down the $700, and stay in the ""Executive Hospitality Suite"" for at least one evening.

As per usual with casinos i recomend utilizing the valet parking.  It is a long walk from the parking structure to the lobby.  It is not much closer to the elevators.  It is worth the few dollars you will spend tipping to use the valet.

The person working the front desk was friendly and funny.  It was a relatively quick process.

The moment i walked into the room i was very impressed.  as i entered the lights came on, the television turned on and the blinds opened up automatically.  The rooms are of a modern design.  There are a lot of dark wood and stone tones.

The television is a flat screen.  Nearly all of the channels are hi definition.

Everything in the room can be controlled from the television remote control or a touch screen control panel on the night stand.  This is an excellent convenient feature.  When i was ready to go to sleep i just touched the master off button.  All the lights slowly dimmed, the blinds closed, and the television shut off.

On April 15, 2016 I called the Aria just to make sure they would accept my support dogs. Although I do not legally have to do this, I always do out of courtesy to any hotel I stay at in case they want to put us in a room away from people etc. The lady I spoke to told me I needed to have a ""service card"" with me when I check in. I explained, I do not have a card, but I do have a doctor's note. I travel all across the country with my dogs and have anxiety being without them. She checked with the front desk who again said no I need this card. My response was I can simply go online and order a card right now for each of my dogs for $150 each that has absolutely no meaning to it if that's what it would take. It was suggested I stay at one of their other hotels that accepts animals. 

I completely understand policies regarding animals, but I have stayed at MANY hotels that do not accept dogs. I call every hotel before I stay there to let them know. I am never questioned about it on the phone or when I check in. We have never gotten any complaints from any guests or hotel staff regarding our dogs. They are small dogs (15lbs) each. They go in their crate when I can't take them out with me to restaurants, casino lobby's etc. They are house trained. They do not go to the bathroom inside at all.

However, the bathroom was very small for the room of this size, but the wet\/dry combination of the bathtub\/shower is good example of how they utilize the space well.

The worst part of the room is the bedding.  The sheets were made of cotton but the quality is horrible.  Have been sleeping at other non gaming resorts, I felt like I was sleeping with sandpaper.  It was one of the bad bedding but their AC was quiet and strong, definitely needed for Las Vegas.

And it was a complicated maze going through all these different buildings.  The free tram they have is so far to the back, there's almost no point.

The bathroom was sleek and the counters\/shower walls were all granite-- the shower and bathtub are connected and share the same door.  The toilet was in the same room but had its own door which was nice. 

I would have given Aria 4 stars if they actually gave me the room I wanted.  I made a reservation more than a month before my arrival and I wanted one Non-Smoking room with one King size bed.  But no, I got a Smoking room with 2 queen size beds.

My girlfriend and I woke up in the morning around 830am feeling itchy so we got up and turn on the light and found a bug in our bed.  We aren't sure if it's bed bug or not but the little guy does looked it a bed bug.
We freaked and call front desk to have someone to come and help.  The lady was rude and like ok someone from housekeeping will come.  After 20 mins , no one showed up so I called again and another guy name Anthony answered the phone and I told him the situation and we had waited 20mins and no one had showed up.  He gave me a big *sigh* and said well the request was only put in 4 minutes ago so someone will be there shortly.  I was like wtf as I've called about 20mins ago and he argue back and said nono the log on shows you only called 4 mins ago..blah blah blah.
I was like just send someone up asap pls.  Then I waited another 20mins ...no one came so I called front desk again and spoke to Anthony and I was piss off this time and he put me on hold and transfer me to a front desk manager (Lenard), he was nice and apologize for the way how his staff was not giving good service but I said I've waited over an hour now and I cannot sleep and can't leave the room as I've been waiting for their team to show up .  He quickly said he will send someone up right away.  I then waited another 30 mins and still no one show up.
At the end I've waited over 2 hours for security to come up so I can file a statement about a bug on   my bed.
After all that problem that ruin my whole morning, all Aria did was give me $50 credit, I mean how insulting !!! I thought Aria was a nice reputable hotel and would treat guest better than just give you $50 for a bed bug issue.

The day after, I was trying to talk to the front desk manager again (Lenard) and he never return my calls, I left couple of memos with his staff to ask him to give me a call.  He never once return my call at all.

We stayed in Aria and Palazzo on this trip, so maybe I'm slightly biased because we had a much better experience at Palazzo.

First, there were lines for -everything-...call me spoiled, but when I'm paying for a five-star hotel, I don't expect to have to wait in an airport-style 20-minute line to check in. The same applied for check-out, but it was even longer. Yes, you can do express checkout, but I've had bad experiences being charged for minibar stuff that I didn't actually eat\/use, so I wanted to view my bill\/summary before checking out. Had to wait at least half an hour to check out, and sure enough, there was a charge for chocolate poker chips (or something like that) that we hadn't eaten.

Second, two of the lights in the room were burnt out. Not a huge deal...called it in and someone came to fix it a few hours later. Still, I think I'm allowed to be picky when I'm paying for a five-star hotel.

The glasses on the table weren't the cleanest (I cleaned them before using them). A card they had on the nightstand (it explained that they won't change your towels unless you request it - wtf?) had writing on the back of it from the previous occupant. Not huge deal-breaker-type things, but not things I'd expect of a five-star hotel.

Third, the room was fairly small. It was nice (more on that in a minute), but our view was pretty ugly during the day (a little better at night), and it felt more like a room I'd get in a three-star hotel.

We went to HAZE nightclub, which I'm posting a separate review about. Suffice it to say, also negative.

Now, the good stuff: everything is in a very ""modern"" style, which I'm a big fan of. They have some cool technology (an iPad-type thing that controls everything in the room from temperature to lighting to music), but it's kind of hit-or-miss in whether it works how you'd like it to, and it's pretty laggy (takes like 3-4 seconds to just scroll through to the next available option).

We had to walk through Cosmopolitan several times to get to where we were going on the Strip and it's about a million times nicer than Aria. It's like $50 or $60 a night more expensive for the basic room (and granted we haven't seen the rooms), but next time we'll -definitely- be staying there instead. It's gorgeous inside and they seem to pull the five-star-hotel thing off way better than Aria does.",3,0,0,"""ARIA Resort & Casino""",The Strip,"""3730 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.107621,-115.17704,3.5,3794,1,Event Planning & Services;Arts & Entertainment;Casinos;Resorts;Hotels & Travel;Hotels

Long version:

We spent 4 days at the Aria for our honeymoon. We picked Aria thinking it was going to be a luxury experience.

Good:
 - We enjoyed the casino and poker room - good amenities, staff was great. Limits get high at night and on weekends but it's a fairly short walk to cheaper casinos (Monte Carlo, NYNY).
 - The restaurants we tried were pricy but generally tasty (although I would not recommend Lemongrass) - prices didn't seem out of line compared to other Strip restaurants
 - Hotel staff were always pleasant but didn't necessarily provide good service...see below
 - Beds were comfortable

Not So Good:
 The room itself was decent but not amazing:
   -  Water pressure in the shower was not strong
   - The A\/C didn't seem to consistently work - had to set the temperature artificially low to get the room cool. 
   - I also thought the desk chair they provided was pretty uncomfortable.
   - The fact that they charge you $25\/day if you want to actually use your mini fridge for personal storage is lame

 We had multiple issues with front desk and housekeeping:
    - When we checked in, the bathroom was not fully stocked - body lotion and shower cap were missing
    - Aria advertises twice a day housekeeping - however, we left the hotel room around 8-9am with the 'service requested' light on, and 12 hours later the room had not been serviced at all.
    - Our last night, we decided to stay in and watch a movie instead of more gambling. The on-demand service didn't work. The front desk called tech support who called us back very quickly (which was great) -- but he said, ""Oh, we had to put a cable box into your room, on-demand won't work."" We weren't informed of this at check-in. The front desk did switch us to another room very quickly after this, but was a little frustrating. Ironically, housekeeping immediately showed up when we were moving rooms to clean it out (she said ""I heard we need a fast turnover!""), even before somebody had come up to deliver our new room keys.
     - We noticed a few times that the room would spontaneously turn all the lights off and close the curtains. When we called the front desk to ask about the on-demand issue, the front desk said ""Oh, the previous guest probably had a sleep timer on and that's what's doing it."" She was right, and great that she immediately knew what was wrong .. but why wasn't it caught during the room turnover process?

Overall neither my wife or I thought the price point of the hotel matched the room or service we received there.

I had the Tonkatsu Shoyo broth (pork bones and soy sauce) with extra charsui (fatty pork), stewed egg and nori. Seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks: The huge pots of broth at a roiling boil, how they heated the bowls before using them, the finishing of the bowls.

Once they arrived, we slurped it down - like you are supposed to, before the Ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed. Excellent noodles, tasty - very tasty broth, fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little ""custardy"" - very yum.

My cousin also ordered a Mini Pork Belly Bowl. The pieces of meat looked like bacon, but they were soft and tender. It's a delicious side dish that complemented the hot bowl of soup.

I ask the other waitress and in a few minutes she brought me the correct order, but mentioned what seemed obvious to me that it would be the same price with or without noodles. 

The tonkatsu broth was rich in texture and deep with flavor and shows quality, time, and care in preparation. I loved it.  However, in comparison to Sora, I like Sora's broth just slightly better maybe because it was just a touch lighter in texture and flavor. Monta's didn't put nearly the amount of pork that Sora does. I do sample the noodles and I prefer Sora's noodles; they are sort of springy and light, Monta's were a little heavier.   My husband who eats ramen the normal way, also prefers Sora.

I like the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork.  The broth is great and the noodles are cooked well.  The pork slice is thin and still has some fat layers on it, which adds to the flavor.  I don't get grossed out by it because it is YUMMY!  If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu\/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)

The only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.

I came here after work with a few coworkers, expecting since it's still the weekend it would be pretty busy (said a co-worker who was raving about this place).

The wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. We ordered:
- Soyu Ramen (extra chasiu)
- 2 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and egg)
- 1 Pork belly bowl
- 4 drinks
total is around $50

Since this was the first time trying a Ramen spot besides my own mothers, I decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. We entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). The people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.

I tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (I told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). The chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. It was mostly melty, fatty, and I found it pointless to get extra.

- TWO 42-inch flat-screen TVs that were back to back. One facing the king bed, one facing the sofa bed. Yes, they work at the same time.
- Free WiFi, no login, seemed pretty fast.
- Gorgeous bathroom with a sliding door that is so quiet, great for sleeping guests.
- Motorized window blinds and shades that you can operate by pressing some wall buttons.
- Stellar window view
- No plastic housekeeping door hangers. Inside the room, you press a button by the side of the door which indicates ""Do not disturb"" or the other requesting service. On the outside of the room, a circle is lit in different colors by your door accordingly.
- No worrying about being bothered by noisy neighbors. So quiet as you sleep.
- Staff service attitude was pleasant - very polite and professional.
- Mannerly valet service. When you call them to bring the car around, they bring it out pronto. No wait time.

NEGATIVES:
- Parking is costly. $18 for 24-hr valet (I forget the other hourly amounts). Vdara doesn't have its own parking lot so you have to find a spot at the neighboring Aria or Bellagio's parking lots with a 10 minute walking distance they said. $10 for self-parking at the Aria. Might as well valet...
- No pots\/pans\/plates\/utensils in the kitchen. You may request for plates and utensils though.
- No coffee machine in the room.
- The fridge, which was super tiny, didn't seem cold at all. No freezer.
- Sofa bed had no bedding and pillows in the room. You had to request for it. Called them once and they said they'll bring it up. Waited almost at least an hour before calling again and they came promptly and set it up.
- The TVs are glitchy. Turn them on, try to change the options to TV\/Movies\/Music, and in a few seconds, the TV screen turns pitch black as if it were asleep\/hibernating. Turn off, turn on, try the same thing and it goes to sleep. I FINALLY realized that I have to press the remote control buttons that are labeled ""Movies,"" ""Shows,"" and ""Music"" or whatever they said. The most user-unfriendly TV ever. No instruction manual or anything explaining this.
- Room temperature doesn't seem to cool down fast enough.
- Bathroom vent near the toilet area is weaksauce. No vent switch either.
- Was rudely awoken at 3-4 a.m. by a hotel staff member asking us if we ordered food. NO. Why wasn't the room number confirmed ahead of time?! This is unacceptable.
- Spa was broken on the day we wanted to use it.
- Housekeeping staff knocked on our door at 11 a.m. as we were about to leave and said she'll come back in 15 minutes. When we returned around 3 p.m., she was still there and needed 10 more minutes...so we sat on chairs because the sheets were wet from the spray she used on it.
- The housekeeping lady was charging her cell phone on top of one of our serving plates, not on the counter. Ew? Disgusting.

We complained to the management and got our resort fees waived. Since they were willing to work with their guests and make the customer happy, I am leaving them a positive review.

Pros:
- Centrally located to just about every other Strip property. The Bellagio is adjacent and easy to get to, and Planet Hollywood\/Caesars\/Paris\/Cosmopolitan are all within a 10 minute walk.
- The cafe downstairs serves decent food, including grab to go options, at reasonable prices.
- You can get from the front door to your room elevator in about 30 seconds, unlike just about every other Strip property where you have to navigate the casino for several minutes. (Vdara has no casino.)
- Uber and Lyft pickup is conveniently in the main valet area, which itself is next the registration desk area. (Some hotels put these all in different places.) UberX to\/from airport was about $12.
- Security checks that you have a key when you go to the elevator, so it's pretty safe.
- Rooms are larger than standard hotel rooms (but don't think suite means much more spacious than a large hotel room).
- View of the Bellagio fountain (for the rooms that face that way) is better than a lot of Bellagio rooms.
- Plenty of outlets near the bed.
- Awesome light thing at the door to signal do not disturb or housekeeping needed. This should exist at every hotel.
- Valets are very quick.
- Sometimes had to wait for an elevator at peak times but usually not much of a wait.
- Business center is near registration and packages were in my hand within an hour of delivery - again unlike other Strip properties where you had to trek through miles of hallways to retrieve it.
- Quiet, business like hotel - not a more typical rowdy Vegas place.

Cons:
- The booking website is confusing about the different kinds of rooms. There must be twenty different combinations of view, suite, and size with undescriptive names, and although I've booked a dozen times I always struggle with figuring out which is what.
- The path to the Strip could be more direct. You can get to the Cosmo very easily but the sidewalk is then blocked off to further down to the Strip. So you have to navigate through the Cosmo, or go a different indirect route via the Bellagio, to get to the Strip. It's frustrating because it's a straight shot down the street but you have to walk in traffic to do it.
- No coffee maker in room.
- The shower head is not adjustable and is set for someone over 6 feet tall. I'm shorter than that so have to sort of press against the wall.
- I'm MLife Platinum and have gotten very inconsistent stuff for that. Sometimes I get the resort fee waived without needing to ask, sometimes I have to ask and get it waived, and sometimes I ask and don't get it. I've stopped asking the front desk what platinums have access to because they never know. Other properties are now giving platinums a letter with this info at check in but I've never gotten it at the Vdara.

Fixing those cons would make the Vdara perfect but I still rate it 4 out of 5 and it's my go to Vegas stay.",0,0,0,"""Vdara Hotel""",The Strip,"""2600 W Harmon Ave""",Las Vegas,NV,89158,36.109300818,-115.178147449,4.0,2315,1,Beauty & Spas;Hotels;Resorts;Hotels & Travel;Event Planning & Services;Day Spas

I had not been to Las Vegas since the City Center was built, so it was amazing to see all the new buildings that sprouted up.  The Vdara is located behind the City Center and off to the backside of the Bellagio.  The hotel itself is modern.  I stayed in a Deluxe suite (read: cheapest room) but there was still a view of the Bellagio fountains.  It has a kitchenette, living room and king sized bed.  The bedroom is not truly separate, but there is a wall unit that divides the space for some privacy.  The nightstands had a funky design, but I think that caused it to keep sliding open, especially once you put something in there.  The room was clean and the cleaning staff did a good job cleaning it daily.  There is a button by the door to signal if you want privacy or the room clean, no more door tags!  

Getting around the strip does require some walking.  There is a convenient walkway between the Vdara lobby and the Bellagio tower.  You need to factor in time when walking from the hotel to the strip.  There may be other ways to get around, but that was the most convenient (and air conditioned!).  

The pool area is pretty small compared to most other Vegas strip hotels.  Don't pick this hotel if the pool is important to you.  I didn't witness the Death Ray, I went at 9am to avoid it.  The chairs had umbrellas near by, so there was some shade--I can't say whether the Death Ray would penetrate them.  The fitness area was nice, but they didn't have cleaning wipes for the equipment.

Check out was easy.  There is the $20 resort fee each day which gets you use of the facilities or 2 very expensive bottles of water in your mini-fridge.  More water is in the fitness center.

Overall, it was a very good hotel.

This hotel is actually pretty good compared to most Vegas hotels. I normally stay at slightly-lower tier hotels like Paris or Flamingo, but for some reason during the weekend of Feb 16-18, rates here were cheaper than those hotels.

Everyone here was friendly- from the valet and bell carrier outside, the woman (Amanda) at the front desk, the baggage carrier inside, to the room service- I had no problems or second-thoughts tipping them.

The room itself was very nice. As their lowest tiered room (the Deluxe Suite), it is very nicely done with a kitchenette, queen-size sofa bed in addition to the king-size bed, and a nicely done bathroom, I was very pleased with everything about this room except one thing.

The only problem I had with the room was the connectivity panel for the TV. My friends and I were trying to play music from our iPods through the speaker system on the TV via USB, but for some reason, the TV wasn't reading the iPod, even after having gone through the instruction on the TV on how to access the connectivity panel. We were also disappointed with the music system in the room. There was an alarm clock with and AUX attachment, but the sound quality was poor. I expected something better when other hotels offer sound systems with built-in iPod docks that sound better.

I normally don't even bother with hotel amenities other than the pool, but this time I used the fitness center. Free for resort guests, their gym is actually pretty nice. The weightlifting area is pretty small with only two benches, but there were hardly any people there in the first place, except for this one guy. He gave me a weird feeling, and he would randomly sing parts of whatever song he was listening to on his headphones. I can't be too sure, but I think he was also giving me a look. Having had the weird feeling, I avoided eye contact altogether. All I could do was look at my friend who instantly knew what I was thinking.

Overall, this hotel is great. The sound system was just something minor, but I had no problem with everything else.",2,3,1,"""Vdara Hotel""",The Strip,"""2600 W Harmon Ave""",Las Vegas,NV,89158,36.109300818,-115.178147449,4.0,2315,1,Beauty & Spas;Hotels;Resorts;Hotels & Travel;Event Planning & Services;Day Spas

1. The sofa bed was broken. We found at about 8 PM. It was never fixed. On the plus side, the hotel gave us another room while they are trying to fix the problem. However, the time that it took them to fix the problem (and the lack of initiative from the management) was disappointing. We had to call several times.

2. The new room has broken bed (on the left side). The support was broken.

3. There was a half-eaten open ice cream in the freezer (seriously?)

4. They compensated us one night. So, the bill was rather low (the only reason that this is a 2-star review).

The hotel is beautiful: very modern, sleek design, beautifully decorated inside. And no casino means no lingering cigarette odors.

The room is really nice. King size bed, pull-out sofabed, a kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, even countertop burners (the hotel will provide pots and pans if asked). The bathroom is almost as big as the room itself. It has both a large bathtub and a standing shower.

The pool is small and pretty standard. There are several cabanas that can be reserved ahead of time, but there are plenty of lounge chairs for everyone's use. 

What knocks my rating down for Vdara are small things which I think a high end hotel such as this one should be able to fix easily. No iPod dock and poor lighting in the rest of the room other than the bathroom. The fridge was not cold enough even though it was set to high: we had to keep our drinks cold in an ice bath. The showerhead had absolutely no pressure. And while the queen size bed was extremely comfortable, the pull-out bed was probably the worst pull-out bed I have had the misfortune of sleeping on. No pull-out bed is comfortable, but this was just bad. Saggy in the middle, and the wire springs poked EVERYWHERE. Sleeping on the floor may have been a better option.

The mandatory $20 resort fee covers free wi-fi in the rooms, use of the pool, and complimentary water bottles each day, among other things. Items\/services requested from housekeeping takes a while to get to your room, but it doesn't mean they're ignoring you: it's because with so many guests, they're usually bombarded with requests, so be patient.

Vdara is conveniently connected to the Bellagio via an overheard walkway, and a tram connects Vdara\/Bellagio with Aria and Crystals mall, as well as Monte Carlo hotel.

Over the past year I have always been a huge customer advocate for the Vdara and told my friends and business associates that if they are traveling to Vegas your hotel should the their destination of choice.
 
However over the last couple of months, my customer experience has been less than stellar and I will no longer frequent your hotel during my Las Vegas business trips. Here is a summary of my experiences and how they have effected by decision.
 
In speaking with my business counter part, who stays as frequently at Caesars as I do at the Vdara, he is upgraded with each visit to either a higher floor or larger room. In addition he is always thanked for his loyal patronage and told how much they appreciate his continued business. On my most recent stay (March 2 - March 5) when I checked in, I explained to the employee that many of my previous room charges had not credited to my MLife Account. She said she would look them up for me and when she accessed my file she said ""Boy, you stay here a lot"" and then gave me a card with a phone number to cal for assistance with my issue. No, thank you for your loyalty Mr Harris or I am so sorry for this inconvenience Mr Harris; just I cant help you but here is a card with a number to call. Stellar service.
 
During my previous stay in February I left two iPhone chargers in the room and asked during my current visit if they could be in a lost and found. The front desk employee was very nice and called the department for in that morning, but then found out that it did not open until 11 AM. She said that she would follow up and call me on my mobile phone with an answer. To this date I still have not heard from anyone, so I will assume nothing was turned in or there was no follow up from the employee.
 
I was also quite shocked on Tuesday morning when I went to the Fitness Center to find out it was under construction. A nice employee at the Spa said that I could use the Aria Fitness center at no charge if I showed by room key, but as it was 49 degrees that morning and I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt that was not ideal. When I asked where the Fitness Center was located in the Aria she said that I could ask the Door Man for directions when I arrived. Really?? Should this not have been something that the front desk notified me of when checking in? Should there not have been some map provided to me at check in with this information? Why was I paying a daily resort fee of $30+ a day and not have use of a fitness center? Lovely.
 
To your credit, the Valet team are amazing. When I arrive each time they always say "" Welcome Back Mr Harris"" even though they have not seen me for two to three weeks. Perhaps this is because I have a bright orange car or because I am a big tipper, but they are the only ones who treated me like a loyal and valuable customer. I would recommend whoever manages that department is promoted to manage the front desk for a better overall customer experience.
 
So now I have a Total Rewards Card and have booked my first room at Caesars next week. I realize that I will be starting over again with a new program, but I am looking for a company to recognize my loyalty and thank me for my patronage.

Pulled infront and was quickly greeted by a valet for hotel parking. Theres a massive metal structure outside that reminded me of a transformer, this blew my mind and made me very excited to see what i had instore.

This hotel has no casino but a lovely bar, eatery, spa, gym, and starbucks Inside.

Take 8 paces to the left you are now in the bedroom with a large king size bed with the coziest bedding with two bedside tables, his and hers lamps mounted above head and another flat screen mounted on the other side of the room divider. Open the large screen like sliding door with frosted glass next to the closet and you have an extravagent spa-like bathoom with a soaking tub, standing shower room enclosed in glass, toilet and sink with backlit vanity mirrors.

There is also a short walkway behind the Starbucks that connects to the Bellagio. Or walk out the front door to the Aria! There is also a ""secret"" passage to the Cosmopolitan: Go out the front door and make a left as if you were going to the Aria. In about 25 yards, the is an elevator and stairs.

Pros: 
Beautiful architecture
Non-smoking
Large heated pool\/hot tub

Here's what happened with me. Vdara guarantees that they'll check you in at 3PM latest. I arrive at 2PM and ask if I can check in early but they inform me that my room was still being cleaned and say they'll call me. I lounge by the pool and wait til 3 but still no call. So I go down and ask about my room. Still being cleaned. I wait til 3:45 and that's when I go to the desk for a third time and I finally have them switch me to another room...which is promptly snapped up by another guest so they have to find yet another room for me which they finally do. After all that, I receive no apologies and of course no compensation. Some guarantee.

So I'm fuming when I arrive at my room. I paid $50 extra for a ""fountain view"" and stupid me thought it meant I could watch Bellagio's fountain show. Well I could....if I pressed my face against the glass and craned my neck, which rewards me with view of 1\/3 of the pool. I plod back down to the check in counter, ask them about the whole fiasco but am told firmly that it is truly the fountain view. I contemplate changing to another room but at that point, I was a broken woman so I just went back upstairs (after flashing my hotel car at the elevator bouncer for the 5th time) and watched a Say Yes to the Dress marathon.

There is complimentary valet parking - the staff varies and some do not look happy even when given money. And when it gets busy, they drive in a way that looks like they're one inch away from a car accident. I tipped $2 every time I wanted my car (normally I would walk but I was with family members that couldn't walk that far or fast) so I think I spent at least $12 on parking alone.

The final ""F You"" to me by this hotel was the room itself. You think it being new and all, it would be clean and nice. HAHAHAHA NOPE. The sofa was creaky and very worn and dirty looking like it had been around for decades. And there was a huge, dangerous crack in the glass wall of the shower that would cut you if you accidentally brushed against it.

Pros:
- Beautiful new hotel. Everything is clean and top notch. The décor is very chic and trendy.
- The rooms are all suites, therefore it's like having your own mini apartment. This is nice if you had to stay here for awhile. You have your kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and living room.
- Beds are extremely comfy. As soon as you hit the pillow you are asleep (or maybe that is from all the late night adventures :-)
- Overall the staff is very friendly.
- The gym is awesome! Tons of cardio and weight machines, as well as free weights and yoga mats.

Cons:
- They did not have any restaurants. They only place you could eat was the Market Café, which is not that impressive. Not to mention it is only open for breakfast and lunch. There is no place (other than room service) that is open for dinner.
- It is far away from everything (except the Aria & Bellagio). You defiantly have to walk a bit to get to the other casinos.
- It does not have a casino
- It's extremely hard to get a taxi. Each time I needed one, I had to wait at least 20 minutes each time. 
- The cleaning service was not good. They left a mess in my room, a mess that I did not originally make.

But the experience with the valet service ruined the entire stay at Vdara. Sure it looks like they hustle to get your car, uses the sir and ma'am, and open the car doors for you as they should. But thats the easy stuff. The challenges of your job come when problems arise and how you deal with it. 

We waited TWO hours for them to find our car. TWO hours!!! That is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard. An hour of patiently waiting went by before we confronted the manager about the wait only to hear, ""It's really busy, your car will turn up soon."" ARE YOU FLIPPIN' KIDDING ME!?! What kind of manager are you!?! Our friends who were with us got their cars 45 min ago and thats the answer you gave me? It took them TWO hours of us waiting before saying that ""We lost your car."" Seriously?... This really cant be that hard guys and it really took you that long before telling us you lost our car?? They were so much more concerned about getting their tips they kept putting us off. They should have had at least one guy keep looking until they found it or came to the conclusion that it was lost and do something about it then. That determination wouldn't have taken 2 hours.

Once up in the room the bell man arrived about 10 mins later and handled our bags into the room. He was really friendly and gave us a little tour of the room.

So much value for what you pay. You basically get a small apartment with an awesome little kitchen. Very tranquil compared to a lot of other places in Vegas, but still very close to everything. (It's right behind The Cosmopolitan.) 

Their room service took pity on me when I had waited 2hrs for a failed GrubHub order to arrive. They had a DELICIOUS veggie burger with TONS of avocado on it to me within like 10 minutes. 

Their bartender was so nice to me as well - she told me to just ""make up a drink"" when I couldn't pick from the menu. 

A hotel that gives you lots of avocado, the exact cocktail I want and free wifi just gets me - you know? Plus I think they allow dogs!

I did however use the pool cabana on the Venetian side. The Palazzo pool is where all the families go. The Venetian is where the TAO beach club happens during the day. Since we were there with a bachelorette party we opted for the Venetian.

So why get a cabana you may ask? You don't need one but it's nice for special occasions. The weekend we were there it was 110 deg during the day. There isn't much shade by the pool. That makes sense since people want to lie out in the sun but I couldn't take more than half an hour of the sun and even then sweat was pouring down my face. The only way to cool off is to go inside, go into the pool or into your cabana. Since we were there with a group of girls with varying desires to tan the cabana was perfect. Half of us took turns outside in the loungers while others hid out inside the cabana which is shaded with curtains to keep in the lovely cool air from the a\/c unit. Yes, only in vegas can you get a poolside cabana with an a\/c unit, mini fridge and tv. The hostess came by every 20 minutes or so to see if we needed anything. You can order food from the pool deck restaurant and have it delivered. In our case we brought a grocery bag full of snacks and also our own liquor. I'm not sure if it's technically allowed by they didn't say anything. Without the cabana we wouldn't have been able to spend the afternoon together by the pool as I'm sure some would get overheated and tired and end up leaving. This way we were able to hang out and do ""bachelorette"" things. 

If I was there with a smaller group of people I probably wouldn't bother with a cabana at $500 for the afternoon (you must checkin at 10 AM and the cabana officially holds just 8 people).

The pool is nice though it's really for standing around and drinking. It's only 3 ft deep and gets crowded so you can't really lie around (no floaties anyways) or play in it. If you have a drink you need to stay within arms length of the pool edge.

The check-in area isn't quite as nice, especially when you consider that invited guest check-in is just a small podium (compared to Mandalay Bay's separate lounge).  However, the rooms are quite a bit nicer and very comfortable.  Finally, you don't have to watch TV sitting in bed!  Venetian gives you a separate sitting area and a separate TV from the bedroom area.  Mrs. C really likes the small stool and make-up table in the bathroom as well.  

I think the food choices are also pretty good at Venetian.  There are 2 different food courts if you want something quick, or just want to run downstairs and bring food back to your room.  There's also Grand Lux Cafe.  I have been to Bouchon twice, and it was ok - maybe French Laundry s just an entirely different experience because you're in Napa Valley.

Two more great things about staying at the Venetian: you are centrally located on the Strip and very walkable to Forum shops, Fashion Show mall and many other hotels.  If you had a race between walking and driving from the Venetian, I'd bet that the person walking would win.  Also, guests at the Venetian get 50% off a day pass at Canyon Ranch Spa, and Mrs. C went crazy when she got to experience that place.  I get to gamble, and she gets to hang out at a super fancy spa.

The hotel is pretty darn nice and fancy, and thank god I split the suite with 100 other people. Just kidding, only 6 of us. Well since it was EDC weekend, the price for the suite was around $825. But you know what? This price is pretty good because I got a great view of Encore beach club, the Trump tower, Treasure Island, Mirage, etc. The suite I got was so nice and big. The couch that was given to us was an L shaped couch, which its long enough for 2 people (one short friend and one tall friend). The two queen size beds were comfy and they feel clean. The beds are definitely not for people with back pain because the beds are super soft and bouncy and you will sink in. The bathroom is big but not that impressive. I guess the only cool thing about this is that there's a TV in there. Yes, I was watching family guy while taking a shower. Speaking of shower, there's a bathtub and separate shower stall. So if you're not going to use the bathtub, then use it to fill it with ice and put your alchies in them. My toilet room was really dark and the door to it was sorta broken because it wouldn't close all the way. The overall door to the bathroom is a double door so the gap between the two doors had a gap. So if you are staying with a creepy friend, be careful.

Other than the rooms, everything is nice. The elevator is fast, the staffs are nice, and security is high. The restaurants are expensive here, and same with all their bakeries like Bouchon and that Cake Boss dude. The shops here are more on the high end. The cheapest store I know here is actually Walgreens and maybe Sephora. Im not sure if they have any buffets here though.

Upgrading to 2.5 stars and this review might go higher depending on what else happens.
_____________________________
I had high expectations for this hotel-and even higher given the fact that we upgraded to a fancy pants suite to celebrate my 40th birthday. While the hotel lobby is beautiful and the poker room giant, the rest of our stay was just okay and I promise to post pictures of our room once I get around to it. We had some really nice service and some not so nice service given what happened here, and I will do my best to outline it.

-Check in time is supposed to be 4pm. Our plane was late and we arrived at 6pm to find out our suite (that had been booked since mid September) was not ready for us. We were offered a lesser suite on a lower floor, but it was a smoking floor so that was a ""NO"". We were then told they would have our kind of suite available in an hour so for inconvenience, we were offered free drinks at the bar (husband does not imbibe) and $100 food and beverage credit (not to include tips). We said that would be fine, brought our bags to the Valet area and went to look around a bit. As promised, an hour later, our room was ready and we had a suite on the 26th floor-all the way at the end of one hall.

Upon walking into our suite, we were blasted by the smell of what I thought was new paint. When the Bellman brought up our luggage, he advised us that this was a newly remodeled suite and that we were the first ones to stay in it. This is usually a good thing, but the smell was so overpowering I felt dizzy and like I would pass out. I called down to the front desk, was on hold for about 15 minutes (word to the wise-if a major rodeo is in town beware for lots of cowboys and no room availability). I was told the hotel was at capacity (7,000 rooms) and they would send housekeeping up to refresh the room with air freshener. Luckily, we didn't stay in the room that long and we did have a bedroom door that shut and we couldn't smell the fumes with the door closed. 

The next morning, I woke up with a bit of a headache and at about 6:45am, I told the husband I was going to get coffee from Bouchon. First, I made a beeline for the front desk.
-I let the front desk know about our room smell. Again, I was advised the hotel was at capacity and was credited another $50 towards food and beverage. I was told that they could have housekeeping come and ionize our room but it would be a 5 hour or so affair. I told them that was fine as we had planned on going to Caesar's for the day and would call when we were leaving the room. I also advised that the jets in our tub were not working properly, there were lightbulbs burned out in the light fixture over the dining room table and that the makeup mirror provided did not work. I was assured everything would be taken care of.
- We were gone all day. Left the Venetian around 9:30 and arrived back around 3:30 with a full expectation our room would be better. When we returned, the ionizer was still going full blast and whilst the bed had been made and the towels and ammenaties replenished, the bathroom was still not cleaned, lightbulbs still not replaced, etc. etc. I called down to the front desk and was on hold for about 20 minutes and was finally connected to a ""manager"". At this point, we were running short on time as we had dinner plans with a couple of my friends and my Mom and her friend before we had tickets to see Jersey Boys. I was advised by this manager that they were at full capacity but they could have another comparable suite available to us but we would have to pack up and be ready to go by a certain time. I reminded him that we were on our way out the door to dinner-meeting people BEFORE our showtime. He was an ass-and I ended up telling him so and we left for dinner and I tried to suck up how furious I was about the room and the smell. Luckily both dinner and the show were enough to take my mind off the room and I did get a call during dinner on my cell from the asshole manager telling me that someone was coming to repair our tub, thoroughly clean the bathroom and that the ENTIRE hotel was out of the particular lightbulb to replace above the dining room table. Hard to believe, but by this point, I was done.

There are other problems with this hotel but there are also some great things. The front desk clerks were awfully nice, the hoochie mama dresses worn by most guests made for great people watching and the overall aesthetics of the hotel are magnificent. I enjoyed the restaurants, the window shopping, etc.

Front desk could use quite a few more clerks, and while they are very very nice, it would be helpful if they could be both nice and efficient, it took about 6-10 minutes for each check in.

Pool areas are fantastic, heated pools, nice lounge chairs, towels and chair covers, lots of bars (they make a lotta $$ off those $10 cocktails)

As for all the complaints about bad\/inferior rooms, remember you always get what you pay for...if you book the lowest category or lowest priced room when making your reservation and the hotel if full, it is inevetiable that not all of those rooms are going to have a fantastic view of the strip. You can assure yourself of this by paying the upgraded prices for the better view rooms, but if you are paying the cheapest price, or if you bought on priceline, then don't expect to get a room on the 30th floor with the great view!!

Casino is very nice, and well lit. Yes, the perfume smell is very annoying at first, but after a while you really forget about it. (but gosh darn they sure do pump the place up with it!) Paybacks are very skimpy, but no more so than of the other big hotels. If you want good payback head to the riviera, sahara or downtown.

I come to Vegas several times a year, mostly for business (well, you always can mix in some pleasure here in Sin City). So I prefer to go to an off-the-strip hotel, like you might find in every other city. 

Why the Hades would I stay at a Courtyard, Embassy Suites or other such businessperson's hotel  when I go to Vegas  you ask? 

Because if you are trying to make business calls, and drive around town as a humble worker bee toiling his trade, you want to be able to get in your hotel and out of your hotel, usually easily and quickly, like you do in Bakersfield, or Missoula, Hackensack or anywhere else Johnny Cash used to sing about.

So the last thing you want to do is be with the prolitereate masses of rookies, wanabees, country bumpkins, and drunk douchebags, waiting in line for 20 minutes for your Valet car, 20 minutes for your bags, walk through endless casinos that stretch for blocks, and fight through oggling crowds fixated on free shows on Las Vegas Boulevard. 

But sometimes you have to make exceptions, like I did today. 

The deal:Luxury Suite on the 33rd floor of the Venetian, with oversized bathroom with marble floors and double doors, a separate commode room, large bathtub and separate glass enclosed shower, vanity, his\/hers sink, king size bed, 3 flat screen TVs, step down living room with gold sectional couch, large coffee table, desk with fax\/printer and WIFI, separate dining table, remote control automated curtains, 2 terry robes, sensor mini-bar, and luxury appointments. 

Wait, that's not all! 

Add $25 in slot money, complimentary golf club rentals, 50% discount on a round of golf at Bali Hai or Royal Links, 20% off your bill at Restaurant Charlie, 2 for 1 well drinks at Salute in the Palazzo Hotel, and 20% off at the Pinot Brasserie. 

Cost on a Thursday night in June?

$300? (WIlliam Shatner scoffs! Go lower, he whispers)

$200? (Bill says, Mamby Pamby! Lower)

$150? (Shatner is asking to be beamed up!)

Try $109. Yup, all that for $109. 

And Bill Shatner had nothing to do with it. Neither did Price Line. I just saw their show, Jersey Boys last year, didn't even stay here then (I was at the Embassy Suites!) and they emailed me the special. 

Turns out I turned the $25 free slots into $60, took that to the Craps table and turned it into $300. So I came out way ahead. 

And instead of seeing businessmen in business casual wear at the Courtyard, there was nothing but lovely women showing a lot of flesh in their little strapless mini-dresses. Las Vegas gives women the excuse to dress like a hooker, and they all do when the sun goes down. 

Only problem is, they can't wear that same mini-dress back in Peoria or Poughkeepsie or Petaluma! Not at the local Marriott at least!

Which reminds me, didn't William Shatner play a ""Hooker"" on TV?",13,17,13,"""The Venetian Las Vegas""",The Strip,"""3355 South Las Vegas Boulevard""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.121189,-115.169657,4.0,3101,1,Casinos;Hotels;Resorts;Arts & Entertainment;Event Planning & Services;Hotels & Travel

This is what brings me to my three star review. I was coming back from running an errand and had some stuff to bring up, so I decided to valet. Since it was a Friday or Saturday night, I guess valet was getting full and they asked me if I was staying there. Yes, I am staying here....he asked to see my room key which I did not have on hand since I knew the other guests I was with were in the room and they were running their own errands around the hotel. Essentially, he was a big grouch and lectured me about how I should carry around a room-key if I want to valet. To me, this was extremely unwelcoming. So if someone was staying at another hotel but wanted to come to a restaurant, they would be forced to self-park? RUDE!

So, not only was it a problem to valet, but every time I did valet it took between 15-20 minutes to get my car, totally unacceptable with cars that are in valet are very close.

Overall, I liked this hotel. It's beautiful, from the grand entrance to the shoppes. The rooms are huge, with the sunken living room area and marbled bathroom. The shoppes are nice, there are tons of restaurants and gaming, and you can also walk over to the Palazzo for their shops. You really don't need to leave the hotel complex unless you are attending a show at a nearby hotel. Everything you need is here.

The downside, or things that I didn't like: The towels were terrible. This is a five star hotel, so I was expecting better. The mattress wasn't great either. The televisions got bad reception (I know, I know, who is in Vegas to watch tv?). The tap water is terrible, so plan on buying bottled. The hotel is really inconvenient to the monorail.

There is no fridge or coffee maker in the room. When ordering crib, they also provide a free bib for the baby and a box of J&J toiletries.

You will find countless people taking pictures of the architecture here at the Venetian, and if you're lucky enough, you may even be asked to take the picture. This happened to us a few times but hey its Vegas. 
There are gondola rides available that will take you through the Venetian shops with the cloud painted ceilings with a singing Gondoliers. 
While searching for a bakery we discovered on Yelp we walked through here seeing all the great shops. There are high end to magic shops for kids. 
The LOVE sign is famous and you will have to wait your turn for a shot at a picture. 
The casino here was one of my favorite that we visited. I play slots mostly and this seemed to have the most themed variety; from Betty white, The Simpsons, Michael Jackson, to Sharknado(yes Sharknado!), plenty were open and available.
A con or pro depending on your opinion is that the Venetian as well as Palazzo are under a different rewards system,called Grazie, than most casinos of the strip (which are mostly Mlife or Total Rewards). This was our first time gambling here so we will see what kind of discounts we see! We would love to stay here!

You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.

They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. 

The only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in.

I called room service and asked why it hadn't been cleaned. The room service manager had apologized and asked about my check out day and time. I passed it on to them that I would be flying out after 5pm and they would give me a late check out at 3pm due to the inconvenience of the room not being clean in which I was ok with.
My final issues were with the final day we stayed there. We called the front desk and asked about our check out and about them holding our bags until our flight left. The front manager told us to leave our bags in the room and someone would pick them up.  We proceed to the casino and mall level and had lunch and gambled a little more. When it was time for us to leave and catch our flight we went to pick up our bags and they couldn't find them, we had over an hour and half until our flight. They ran us around and then escorted us to the back and asked us if we could identify our bags and we couldn't.  We looked around and they escorted us to the security area and then the front desk. We spoke to the front desk manager and we later came to find out our bags were still in the room.  Now, they said it was policy for them to pick up the bags while we were still in the room but we were told over the phone that they would pick them up from the room and had told the room service people that were cleaning the room at the moment that they were going to pick up the bags they still didn't get our bags.
I will tell you we missed our flight. All said and done after we found our bags, we had less than 45 mins to leave the hotel and check our bags and get on a flight.  The hotel offered us a refund on our resort fees, $132 and a $200 food credit and an extra night at the hotel.
Not a comp for my 3 evenings in Vegas. Not a comp for our missed flights. Nothing! I will tell you I am pissed that I ended up having to rent a car because I didn't want to pay an additional $750 a flight to get home for two of us to get home for a 19 hour drive back home to san San Antonio. 
I ran through the process of security and trying to get refunded through the hotel. I spent two weeks, back and forth, on the phone with Lean Davis, in which she finally concluded that I would have been able to make it to the airport and had our bags checked within 45 min from the hotel, and did not deserve a refund for our stay. I further more asked her to speak to her supervisor and she told me he would not speak to me and he is too busy of a person to speak to me. I told her that I followed the steps and process that they asked me to  and she responded to me and told me that I should write a letter. I asked her why she didn't tell me to do that in a first place and she told me she would have done weeks ago and that I am ""A GROWN MAN"" I should have done it weeks ago.
I will say I have let it be. I will also say that it fired me up that my work colleague got a card in the mail offering him 3 night stay for free when they couldn't even comp my nights after causing us to miss our flights and drive over 20 hours home and can't even recognize fault.
Lean Davis, here is my official complaint. I am sorry that your boss was too busy to talk to me and honestly no one can make it to the airport from your hotel and check their bags in less than 45 mins for you to find value in why you should refund me a couple night stay because I had to drive 20 hours home because I didn't want to pay over $1500 to fly home.
Yes, ""I am a grown man,"" thank you for sending my colleague offers for free nights. When you could have done more for our stay.

We were here for a bachelor party (yes, there were three girls present)... the boys had a few suites and the girls stayed at the T.I. across the street cause we're poor.

Anyway, the suites weren't as glamourous as I had envisioned them to be, to be honest. They seemed really old fashioned and not as nice as I had expected... I've seen some of the suites at the Caesar's Palace (which is older) and they were nicer than the Venetian suites...

They bring a good variety of bread to the table.  I am partial to the cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in.

I recommend getting reservations, because this place was packed!  And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.

It's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:
-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.
-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.
-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.

This is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.  But sometimes it's about the experience and crossing items off your bucket list, and if you can't do that in Vegas, then you might want to check if you still have a pulse.  =)",4,2,2,"""Mesa Grill""",The Strip,"""3570 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1171245659,-115.174792707,4.0,3012,1,New Mexican Cuisine;Mexican;Restaurants;Southern;American (New);Tex-Mex;American (Traditional)

Big mistake.

The food is way overpriced for what you get.  You're basically paying for the name instead of quality food.  Basic cocktails are $12+.  Desserts are $11 and not big enough to share (no I'm not a pig either).  

I ordered the pork tenderloin which was $36 for 3 tiny pieces (c'mon, it's not sushi!) and a very dry tasteless ""tamale"".  My dad and my wife had the turkey dinner for $38, again very small portions and they later told me it was cold!  My 12 year old son had the salmon which he really enjoyed, but for $32 can't you at least include 1 side??!!

The best thing I can say about the restaurant is the bread basket!  The waiter warned us of the ""spicy"" bread which was not spicy at all - just a couple bits of jalapeno, but the cheese crust was delicious.

The service was ok, but nothing special.  It took forever to get our food (we were there for 2 hours), but I can understand that due to the holiday.

And because we're in Vegas, we know we have an impressive selection to choose from. But regardless of all of the other 5 star grills and restaurants boasting the greatest menus in town, we find our hearts set on Bobby Flay's place and have to pay it a visit. 
I wasn't sure what to expect out of Mesa Grill, but I was totally in love with everything about this place. The style - a relaxed yet elegant and modern space with warm lighting and beautiful décor - exactly what I'd imagine coming from a restaurant that Bobby Flay has anything to do with. 
We were seated right away in a cozy booth toward the back of the restaurant, giving us ample opportunity to people watch and enjoy each others company on our first big vacation with just the three of us. 
Our service was great, albeit a bit slow. But, to be fair, it was a bit of a busy night and we were seated in a section with a couple of larger groups, so I can excuse the wait times for refills and for our checks. But hopefully, next time everything will be a little bit more prompt - I'd love to give that last star - I know this place deserves it. 
Now for the main event - the food. 
Let me start off by saying that if I had been in pretty much any other restaurant and seen a steak that was over a pound, I would have rolled my eyes and moved right on down the menu in search of something a less ridiculous. But, because I all three of us were going all out, I just went with it. The description of the Chipoltle Glazed Rib Eye was too enticing - despite the fact that this monster was 22 ounces of beefy goodness. I don't have words for how amazing this cut of cow was. Cooked to a PERFECT medium rare (what else would you expect from a place like this?), I probably ate an impressive three quarters of it. I just couldn't stop. Do yourself a favor and fast for a majority of the day to eat this whole thing, because trust me - it's worth every last, heavenly bite. The side of cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that I ordered, however, was not forgotten. I nearly finished all of those, too.

Came here for lunch with a ton of research from other Yelp reviews. There were many reviews that mentioned how accommodating the wait staff were and to not be afraid to ask for dinner items during lunch time. 
Well this wasn't the case for me... I was really interested in the Pork Tenderloin and goat cheese tamale. When I asked our waiter ,Mike ,it seemed as though I was annoying him with my questions and replied we have what is on the menu. 
We ordered the Partida Margarita and Prickly Pear Margarita. The prickly pear was the better of two but both were very smooth.
Each table is served a basket of bread that seems to be a big cause of debate. It is served with a jalapeno cornbread muffin, jalapeno white bread, and a raisin bread.
The cornbread was my favorite! It had a ton of flavor and with the fresh butter was simply delicious. There is some debate about it being too dry...so if you are more of a cornbread casserole fan, this may not be for you. 
We were lucky enough to try the tiger shrimp tamale which tasted great. The sauce was the best part of this dish. 
I ordered the Pork tenderloin sandwich which was pretty good. It has a strong apple flavor but I loved the sauce on the sandwich. It is served with fries but I wish a sauce was served with, even if it is just ketchup. 

My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp tacos which was recommended as the most popular item. When they brought out the tacos it seemed a bit underwhelming. It is displayed as two shrimp skewers with two tortillas, and served with a trio of sauces including mango salsa, green salsa, and guacamole so you can make your own taco.   It is interesting because as a Food Network Star watcher, Bobby Flay seems to be against a ""make your own"" concept because its possible for customers to not get the flavor combination you are going for. The shrimp had a nice flavor but needed more to fill up your belly.

They started us off with their ""bread basket"" which had a variety of breads.  While I know we should have saved room for our brunch, we ended up eating the whole bread basket and had more!!!  Our favorite was the scones and coffee cake.. Was hard NOT to eat these!  And the server was SO NICE to provide us with only our favorites the 2nd go around!! YUM....

We then got Bobby Flay's specialty, The prawns over a homemade corn tamale! LOVED it - we pretty much licked the plate clean!  If you get a chance - go on their website - they show how they make it and it's a MUST order when you come here...

I also got their apple salad which because of it's simplicity was so tasty!  That dressing was perfect with the salad - can't recall what it was other than we basically inhaled the entire salad.  And I enjoyed it with my prickly pear tea! They gave me simple syrup so I can add the right amount of sweetness! Loved it!!

Hubby had their sweet potato hash and LOVED it.  Cooked perfectly - but because we ate so much bread - he could only eat one, so we brought the other back to our timeshare which luckily had a kitchen so we could heat it up and devour the next day and it was JUST as yummy!

I had Egg over Taquillas.  Who knew such a simple dish could be SO GOOD! The egg was so light and fluffy - on top of cheese and they smeared a little seasoned black bean paste between the toasted crispy taquillas. Flavors and textures partying in my mouth!! I'm drooling now just thinking about this dish!  So simple and so delicious!

We were SO STUFFED - we definitely felt like we had to roll out of there - thank goodness in Vegas it's all about walking!  And the server was so nice - they gave me a ""to go"" cup for my prickly pear tea and topped it for me so I got to sip it as we walked around Vegas.  The servers are so personable and attentive - it was a nice welcoming feeling...  Will definitely come back - and maybe try lunch or dinner next time!

The interior of the restaurant is quite nice, but the atmosphere is a bit too casual for the prices it carries.

We ordered the Tiger Shrimp with garlic corn tamale and Pan Seared Squid for appetizers. Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. The sauces are a tad too sweet. The tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. The squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.

I had the veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. The wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.

Others in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which I sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat. But my friends loved their dishes.

Double baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like the sweet taste more than spicy.

Our waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty.

The comments below are either my thoughts on what I ordered or their thoughts almost verbatim (we discussed my writing a review over drinks after we left)

House margaritas: Extremely heavy on the lime, to the extent that the tequila is lost and it ends up tasting like a key lime martini

Blue corn pancake with duck: had potential, but it was over sauced to the point that the duck was lost. The pancake was more of a crepe, and it was overpowered as well. All you could taste was the sauce.

Cornmeal crusted chile relleno entree: The chile relleno was good and cheesy. The crispy crust was unique, but it didnt necessarily add to the dish.

22 oz bone in rib eye: I ordered this medium rare. It came on the blue side of rare throughout and burned to a crisp on the outside. The chipotle glaze was completely lost and instead it tasted like a briquette. I was especially disappointed in this rib eye because a) I can cook a steak better than that and b) It's Flay's restaurant; you don't screw up grilled meat.

Side dish of chile relleno filled with black beans and rice. Good, but not great. The grainy cornmeal crust took away from an otherwise excellent stuffed chile (the person who ordered this is different than the person who ordered it as an entree)

Sixteen spice chicken: No complaints from the person who ordered it. She seemed pleased but not overjoyed and appreciated the large portion.

Overall, none of us felt that Mesa Grill met expectations. Two of us gave it a 2 star review, the third would give it a 3 star review.

The jalapeno poppers we ordered were amazing!  Not for a vegetarian though, there was bacon in the sauce.  The poppers come out piping out, in shot glasses with ranch bacon sauce on the bottom.  The bartender said he believed those were the best item in the restaurant, and I would have to agree.

The next time we went, the line was crazy!  But since we did not want to pay the price for their drinks it was ok.  We sat in the lounge, listening to music and watched a drunken man try to be a part of the band playing.  After an hour wait, we were finally buzzed.  This time we had burgers and I got a soba noodle salad.  The American burger was bland but I guess that is what you get for ordering one of the less adventurous burgers on the menu.  The soba noodle salad was not good, not good at all.  It had all the great fresh components but the dressing was full of black pepper and no other flavors.  So no Thanks!

Overall, Meh!  The lines, the food, and the expensive a$$ drinks equaled no thanks.  But the cute server outfits and the jalapenos equaled . . . maybe?

Obviously Gordon isn't the one cooking the food or managing the restaurants but my goodness there were rookie mistakes made at every turn.  

First off there was a decently long wait for just my husband and I, granted it was Valentine's day during the prime dinner time rush, but still with no where to sit down and a bunch of hosts that didn't even try to present a friendly demeanor, I'm counting that as strike 1.

After we were sat, our waitress came over in a fairly quick manner but was horrible at reading social cues and just conversing with us, not sure if she was new or just had a hard time hearing us because it was fairly noisy.

The burgers are extremely overpriced and come a la carte so my husband and I had to pick just one side to share because one order of fries is enough to feed three to four people.  We waited what seemed like quite awhile for food and when it finally arrived I was devastated.  Everything was cold, both burgers and fries were luke warm at best.  Normally I would not complain but I got the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15 I think) that is served with cold avocado which just made me feel like I was eating a burger leftover out of the fridge.  Our waitress was kind enough to get me a new one but it still tasted ""dead"" (sat in the window for much too long) and was honestly pretty bland.

Our sweet potato fries were even worse.  They come dusted with powder sugar which I had requested left off but I received fries sprinkled with sugar anyways.  Not to mention they were stone cold.  The honey mayo or whatever that awful dipping sauce they came with was terrible, we asked for some ketchup and ranch.  

All in all, don't waste your money here.  The service was poor, the food was lackluster.  In the words of Gordon Ramsay...""damn, damn, damn"" (in a British accent of course).

I was sitting at Extra Lounge enjoying cocktails and live music and thought I would order a burger to go since I was literally next door. The hostess kindly took my order and I paid for it and was told they would text me when it was ready. I waited about 20 minutes and then finally received my message. It took one minute for me to see the text and go back to the restaurant. When I picked it up the boxes were bagged to go, no utensils or napkins. I then requested the items and the hosted grabbed them. It took me less than a minute to get back to my seating. When my friend and I opened our to go boxes, both burgers (the farm and uber) looked like they had been sitting out and they looked like pre-frozen shaped patties. He had his protein style and mine was medium rare with the bun.  I took a couple of bites and was expecting some incredible flavor bursts but was let down. Both burgers  were bland with no seasoning and I realized then they left off the bacon I requested. I proceeded to take my burger back and reported to the hostess that the burger was cold and the bacon was missing. The manager came over and promptly apologized and removed the cost from my bill. Giving me a deer and head lights look she tried to convince me to try dining with them again. It was the least genuine attempt I've seen.

I worked in the restaurant industry long enough that I can tell when food has been sitting.
This burger, although ordered as medium rare, should have been warm on the outside.
There wasn't any hint that it was even cooked on an open flame and I couldn't even distinguish the cheeses. Mind you I eat rib eye steak or ground beef (raw, rare, or medium rare) almost every day and I can smell and distinguish flavors very easily.    Overall, this is overhyped and doesn't deliver.

Amazing sweet potato fries, those were some of the best I had ever eat, it mix with vanilla powder, and the fries below of the cone were not as tasty and a bit overcooked.  Our group orders two burger, the farm and hell burger.  The burger was probably 1\/3lb, there not big but just about right if you eating solo.  The buns were sesame both side; first time I see this in a burger bun.  It reminds me like those sesame bagel.  I was not a fan of those burger bun but there were definite unusual, the hell burger were supposed to be very spicy, so I told to lower the spice.  The spice level came way out very weak and defeat the purpose.  

The service was good, refill water quick.  However was annoyed by their keep trying to sell us the dessert menu.  The food is good but not worth the price tag, since this is the strip is not a bad deal, despite burger cost $15 and fries were almost $10.  After all Subway nearby cost as much $10 for a foot long isn't such bad trade off.  The check comes with a ipod with a thank you message from Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant atmosphere was modern inside, but the attraction is the big frame display of the restaurant. If you hungry.  If you are very hungry, better off goes to buffet or something, this however is a great  mid night meal after a club or a show.

I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger really good idk what the previous reviewer was saying that it was too hot for her boyfriend with the peppers it was a walk in the parks.

We had to wait in a line to get seated which was kind of annoying since people kept trying to bypass the line because they didn't know it existed. 

Once we sat down, we got explored the menu. The iPad menu that showed pictures and descriptions of each item was really cool and such a creative idea. We shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio and ordered the onion rings which were good, but we probably could have done without them. 

We ordered both sweet potato fries and regular fries. I loved the sauce that came with the regular fries (chipotle ketchup) but I prefer savory sweet potato fries over these, which had powdered sugar on them. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was sooooo good, but I definitely thought it could have been spicier. My boyfriend got the Farm burger which he loved because it's English like him.

There was a line and we waited about under an hour. There's a huge menu outside; so it's good to get a glimpse of what they have to offer so you don't have to wait and waste time once you've got a table.

FISH AND CRISP SANDWICH- ale battered cod, salt and vinegar crisps, and fresh dill tartar sauce
When I first saw it, it looked so good, but when I bit into it, it was bland and could've used more seasoning. The tartar sauce didn't do it much either. The cod tasted fresh, but lacked flavor. It had a nice crunch and consistency, but that was about it.

HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER- asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato
I liked this burger. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. It tasted like a typical burger, but a burger done right. There were no bold flavors that stood out, but if you're craving for a burger then I would recommend this one because you got the melted cheese, the heat from the peppers, the creaminess from the avocado and the acidic juicy tomato all with the perfectly cooked patty.

CHANTERELLE BURGER- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam
This burger was earthy. The mushrooms and the arugula were very pre-dominant in this burger. I didn't enjoy it too much. It was okay, but a bit strong for my taste. The burger itself was not dry, but could've used more seasoning or another flavor profile.

SWEET POTATO FRIES- vanilla powdered sugar, honey, and jalapeno mayo
If you love sweet potatoes then these fries are for you! These fries had a nice outer crisp and sweetness to it because of the powdered sugar. The jalapeno mayo didn't add much heat to the fries, but there are different layers of sweetness.

BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS- parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, and cheddar ranch dip
I did not like the onion rings at all. They were so dry and almost flavorless. It says they use beer batter, but I didn't taste anything. What a huge disappointment! The serving was huge, but after one bite, it was left the way it was.

TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli
You could really taste the truffles in these fries. They had such a strong taste and I love it! You could smell it and definitely taste it. Truffle has such a crisp taste, but if you only put a little in it's very subtle; so they must have put a butt load because it was so strong.

Overall, the burgers here were okay.

My party of 5 came here on Friday for brunch. There wasn't a wait yet at 11AM but after we finished our meal, we saw a ~30-minute queue to be seated. While I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't mind doing so for these bougie burgers. 

After browsing the menu, I settled on the Farm Burger w\/ duck breast bacon & a fried egg. It seemed to be a popular option and the waiter even confirmed that it was his personal favorite so I didn't have any ""buyer's remorse"" about my choice. 

The burger itself was very rich and juicy. The hero of the meal was the runny egg, which was a really nice touch. I enjoyed my burger...however, my bf's Hog Burger was a burger of impossibly EPIC proportions!!! After first bite, I was sold. It was flavorful, savory, had that magical X-factor, and I definitely see why it got a special spot on the menu apart from the other selections. If it sounds like I have the biggest school girl crush on it, it's because I do. 

Aside from our main course, we also ordered a portion of truffle fries to share. The fries were a hit! Our waiter suggested we order 2 for 5 people and when the fries came out in a cone, I questioned our decision of ordering just 1... The portion size looked dinky for $10. However, it ended up being just right because we were all full from our burgers. 

Service here was also spectacular, which was not surprising because GR is known for running a tight ship. Ambiance is also relaxed so you don't need to be dressed to the nines.

Boy what a nightmare. We paid over $600 dollors for two nights and expected great service, but we got motel 6 type service or worse. First our room was dirty, the bedstand the table and the phone was sticky, and never cleaned. We didn't complain thinking they will come and clean it the next day. We politely asked them to clean the sticky stuff and bring us new towels and do general housecleaning. When we got to our room, the new towels were on the dirty unmade bed. The old towels were still on the floor. So basically they just threw new towels on our bed and left. We still didn't complain. What really made me mad was that the room that cost $600 dollors was nothing more than a junky ass room. When I flushed the toilet it made jet airplane sound letting everyone know in the building that I'm taking a dump. How classy. On top of that I couldn't sleep due to wind noises. Everytime a wind blew you can hear it loudly inside. With all this we still didn't complain. What broke the camels back was at the pool restraunt. We ordered our food to go but decided to stay and eat. We were told by the hostess that we were not allowed to eat in the restraunt even though we paid for the food. My wife politely said we will order more food. She said I understand but this is our policy. You can't eat to go food in the restraunt. We said but we bought the food from your restraunt. She said sorry that's hotel policy. So we bought food from their restraunt, and offered to buy more food, but was told that we couln't eat in the restraunt.

At check-in, they told me the rooms had been renovated, so I was pretty stoked. The room, however, was smaller than I'd experienced previously, and dark. Plus, NO ROBE. Wtf. 

I was pleased to see that they now had coffee in the room, and wasn't even mad that they charge $4 for a ridiculously tiny cup. But do you think I could get anyone to re-stock it? Three days, no re-stock. And they've been in cleaning, so it's not like they don't know.

Plus, I was really excited to take a bath the other night in the awesome tub, but when I pulled the plug, the tub drained into the shower, and pushed this disgusting black stuff out of the drain that smelled so gross.

The check-in lobby is very bright and airy, the dealers are friendly, and the rooms are nice.  On the few occasions that I have been invited to check-in at the VIP lounge behind the double doors, it is by far the nicest check-in area that I have been to.  The service reps are dressed in jacket and skirts, and they are super polite.

The big draw in the summer is the pool, and here's something worth mentioning: not even the Four Seasons guests get pool privileges at Mandalay Bay.  The wave pool definitely seems to be the most crowded.  If you time it right and swim hard, you definitely can get a free push down 1\/2 the length of the pool.  Or, you can swim in the lazy river and feel like you are as fast as an Olympic swimmer.  

The one weakness at Mandalay Bay is the food.  I've eaten at Raffles, the Noodle Shop, Red White & Blue, and the buffet, and none of those meals were particularly memorable.  The Strip Steak restaurant is kind of a splurge place for me at nearly $90-$100 per head, but it was quite good.

Parking is quite a bit better now that they installed those clever escalators in the structure.

Do not stay here IF you are planning to go clubbin at XS, Surrender, Tao, MArquee, etc. Even though it is on othe trip, it is still way too far for you ladies to walk, unless you want to spend money ($$$) on the cabs. This hotel is more like a resort.

Nice and clean and new amenities.  If you want to come and relax at the resort, this is a great place to stay!  They also have many pools, including a lazy river.  Just a note:  they charge a $15 resort fee. 

Check in time is after 3 pm but if there's room available, they will let you check in.  Check out time is 11 am but you can request to check out later at noon if desired.


There's also a tram from Mandalay Bay that goes through Luxor and to Excalibur. (save you the walk but it is nice to walk through the hotels and see all the shops and pass by some of the exhibits.

First of al this place is ENORMOUS and, as I've been to several different events there, know that it does get easier to find your way every time .

The food is great anywhere you eat - since I was there for 4 nights I mixed it up and was never displeased. There also seems to be many traps on any given attempt to leave the hotel....but they were great, lively spots to stop for a drink or just some entertainment.  

A must, should you have the opportunity, is the Foundation Room.  The food - mmmm...my event was completely catered with incredible delicacies from Asian delectables, ribs, shrimp, and more to a the most lavish spread of goodies waiting to be dunked in the towering chocolate fountain.  Then there is the view......that's all that needs to be said...the view.  Comfortable nooks and rooms of historical enchantment suck you in and forbid you to leave.

For the VH1 Rock Honors Awards, the convention area was perfect.  But it was a bit of a hike so wear comfy shoes.

It was a great place for my corporate convention, save the ventilation system just outside the meeting room which failed to absorb the tons of smoke expelled by my jonsing colleagues on break.  The smoke seeped into the rooms and clung on dearly, giving me a major allergic reaction typically void in even the densest of cigar smoke ridden lounges.

-The gaming was okay, but not too much energy happening.
-The race and sportsbook area were HUGE and packed w\/ plenty of TVs to watch the games and track your bets.
-The maids were nice and always working.
-The rooms were spacious, but nothing really special to report.

Even Cholula could not save it. It was not bad. It just liked any significant flavor. The portion was significant and it comes with your choice of fries. I chose the waffle fries. They were OK. 

Our service was as good as can be expected for a group of this size. They were all friendly, and did their best to keep up.  This is the reason they are getting three stars instead of two.

They would not divide up the bill at all. Only one bill per table. That was a giant pain. It took forever to work through a bill for over 30 people.

They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their over sized desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's weird, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed.

I think it's pretty convenient that they have a take out counter outside.

You think you're going to be handled efficiently because of the cellphone based text notification, but when you get the alert and you go in, no one seems to know what they're doing. 

When you read the menu, you think, ""All of this looks so good!"" It is not good.

The best thing we ordered was the frozen hot chocolate, which is initially delicious, but after a few sips, quickly becomes underwhelming and leaves something to be desired. The size for two can easily be shared by four, but $15 for what is basically a chocolate smoothie is still unreasonable.

My friend ordered the breakfast burger and there were two eggs on it - one of them was raw. I mean, clear white, blubbery yolk, egg-didn't-see-the-surface-of-the-frying-pan RAW. It slooshed out of his burger like snot when he lifted it up to take a bite. 

My other friend ordered the chicken and waffles. She said the fried coating was saturated in oil and the waffles were brittle and crunchy, like it had been left under a heat lamp for too long.

I ordered the balsamic strawberry waffles. The strawberries were supposed to be soaked in balsamic. They were just regular strawberries and all of the balsamic was poured in the center of the bottom waffle. The waffles were at least softer and tastier than my friend's waffles, but they weren't anything special - they were your typical run of the mill, mass-produced Belgian waffle.

Four items cost us over $84. This place is a rip-off and the food sucks. The atmosphere is noisy and crowded.

We were seated fairly quickly for our group of seven (only about a 5-10 minute wait).

My friends had an omelet and both of them could not finish even half of the omelet.

I had the caprese salad which the only thing that was good about it was the tomatoes. They used beautiful red, yellow and green heirloom tomatoes. But I did not enjoy the glob of ""wet cheese"" they slabbed in the middle of the plate or the oily over-poured dressing. So... they have a good tomato supplier.

My friends decided to order the veggie burger to split since they were still hungry... I tasted the burger and it was pretty good itself. The patty reminded me of a giant fat Dr. Praegers frozen veggie burger. The waiter said they do hand make it in house. The execution of the burger was blah. Big dry white bun, lettuce tomato and avocado. Dry. For the price, you can do better.

Last hope! We tried the frozen hot chocolate to salvage the meal. Hmmm... its kindof of like ovaltine. Its more melty\/watery consistency, not smooth and creamy.

I was staying at the MGM which didn't have to many breakfast spots near it except for Denny's and the buffet. I then searched on Yelp for other breakfast spots in walking distance because I was tired of eating at the buffet for breakfast.  I then came across Hash House a Go Go on Yelps search results.  When I saw the name it made me think.... wait I've heard of this place before.  The reviews for this place were amazing and I did a little research to check and see where\/how I might have heard of this place.  I then came across a food blog that mentioned them being featured on Food Networks show Diners Drive-ins & Dives.  That's when I remembered where I had seen this place before.  We then took a looooooonnnnnnnnnng walk down Las Vegas blvd to the Quad hotel so that I could indulge in the goodness I remember seeing on Food Network and also the pics that were uploaded to Yelp.  When we arrived the wait didn't take that long due to it being only two of us.  I'm sure if it was 3 or more we would've had a much longer wait.  After quickly skimming through the menu I instantly knew what I wanted to order.  I asked the waiter what he would recommend and he stated that everyone comes in for the Andy's Sage Fried chicken.  We ordered the Andy's Sage Fried chicken and the corned beef house hash.  When the orders arrived I couldn't believe the amount of food they give you for the price.  I mean this was like a mountain of food for two.  My order arrived in a cast iron skillet with eggs on the bottom piled with potato hash and the house made corned beef and Swiss cheese on top with a homemade biscuit.  I then took a bite of my corned beef with Swiss cheese and man o man.  That was some of the best corned beef I've had in a long time. Everything was well seasoned and fresh straight from the farm I'll like to add. I didn't get a chance to taste the Sage fried chicken but it looked amazing. I honestly couldn't eat my entire meal.  Might I add the prices were not crazy either.  My meal was $12 and the Sage fried chicken meal was $15. After leaving I wanted to kick myself in the a$$ for not coming here earlier during my stay. I could have ate here every morning for half the price of a buffet while leaving stuffed like I ate at a buffet.  This is a perfect example of ""if you knew better you'll do better"".

First of all, I had never heard of this place, and my mom was adament about wanting to try this place because of all the awesome reviews she'd seen here on Yelp! I'm glad she insisted on it, because this place was yummmmm-o. 
Now, let me be frank, the parking at Emperial Palace is a pain in tukhus. At least it was on the night we came. The restaurant was also a little tricky to find inside the actual casino, but once we figured out where we were going, we were good to go. 
If there is one word I can use to describe the food here: hugemongous. But that's also leaving out how delicious it is. I ordered the meatloaf with BBQ sauce, and it was DIVINE. Seriously, I wanted to buy a gallon of it and take it home despite how hard it would have been to get it through airport security. I ordered like three extra serving cups of it. The meatloaf sandwich was rich and buttery, and served with a steak knife because it was so freakin' massive. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it or take it back to our hotel, so I had to leave about 1\/2 to 2\/3 of it on my plate. Sad. 
My mom ordered the Pacer's Hash, and it smelled awesome. Our friend Tiffany, who wasn't that hungry, thought it smart to just order a couple of sides, and chose the loaded cheese and bacon mashed potatoes and a side salad. WOAH. These things could hardly be considered sides. They were both the size of an entire meal. 
So if you're looking for some delicious food at a good price, Hash House is where you'll find it. 
And, you can burn some of those calories off by gambling downstairs when you're done.

My friend and I saw how big the plates were, so we decided to split something. We went with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Thanks to our cool waiter, we also ordered a side of bacon for $3 in order to avoid the plate split charge of $2.50. 

The food was SO good! Their bacon was dee-effing-licious, as was the chicken and waffles! SO much food, even when we split a plate, we still couldn't finish it! The plate comes with two whole fried pieces of chicken breast, along with 4 Belgium waffles. Their waffles even have bacon IN them! SO damn good!!!

It's a LOT of food, I'd say split a plate with someone. Unless you're a linebacker, there's NO WAY you'll be able to finish something on your own. Their pricing isn't bad, considering how much food it is. I know their whole thing here is ""huge plates"", but lowering the price and limiting the amount they give you, would make more sense to me.

Boy was the waiter right. Not only was this the largest chicken and waffles I have ever seen but it was also the most delicious fried greasy bird that I have ever had. It was crispy, sweet and savory all at once.

The chicken and waffle was huge and it was very good! The chicken was crispy and moist. There was four pieces of waffles stacked on the bottom. The waffles were cooked perfection. Not to mention, it had strips of bacon cooked into it.
The chorizo hash was so good and was perfect after a week of drinking. The hash came with a large tortilla, fruits, and two eggs. 
You have to try their watermelon kiwi lemonade. It was so pretty. It had three layers of color and a slice of watermelon as garnish.

It was magnificently disappointing.  

After making my mom trudge through the crap-hole that is, the Imperial Palace, we took the middle escalator (important fact) up to HHAGG.  

There was no wait, but it was relatively late after the LOVE show.  We were both tired, hungry and not feeling well.  I ordered the grilled cheese.  It was huge and had a steak knife stuck in the middle.  The bread wasn't very grilled and the cheese wasn't melted and gooey.  But it was BIG.    

Mom wanted a BLT which is served on the lunch menu and although they serve sandwiches at dinner, the BLT isn't one of the dinner offerings so no dice.  This rule was explained by our somewhat ditsy server who said it was important to ""maintain the integrity of the original HH in order to keep the license. ""  That made us feel so much better about the lack of accommodation.    

She ordered a Cesar salad instead.  It was a huge plate of iceberg lettuce, some croutons and a giant tree of Rosemary.  Wha???

But David, rebel that he is, wanted instead a combo of fried chicken, eggs, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuit. Our server tried hard to steer David back to the benedict - ""you have to trust me on this"". But it wasn't what he wanted, and he stood firm. Substituting sausage for bacon was not allowed. Maybe that's what happens when you wander off the recommended path. My chicken was very generous, and I loved the fried leeks on top. One piece of chicken was very good, the other had some soft and chewy bits and just didn't taste as good. The waffles were ok, but nothing special.

There was four of us girls - enjoying our girls weekend in Vegas and my girlfriend said we absolutely had to try this place... knowing about the large portions - we figured we'd share - order 3 dishes for the  4 of us!

Wow - I think we should've stuck to 2 dishes for 4 of us but actually it didn't matter because we got to try their DELICIOUS and the BEST EVER Chicken and Waffles; along with their brown sugar banana pancake and their meatloaf hash...  a ""little"" of everything! :)

First - let me tell you - the Chicken and Waffles - while HUGE was truly the BEST I've ever had... and I've had plenty...  this is by far even better than Roscoe's or our local TOWN restaurant...  the chicken was juicy, crunchy with that SAGE flavor - OMG... add that to the light fluffy waffles... you absolutely had the best of sweet and FLAVORED savory...  a MUST try dish FOR SURE!!!

The meat loaf has was EXCELLENT - lots of bits of delicious meatloaf with veggies and potatoes - but I will admit the chicken and waffles definitely was our #1 choice...

Their brown sugar banana pancake was absolutely a great way to end the meal - wish we got it at the end versus at the same time as everything because I think HOT would've been even better...  they had so much bananas in there made the inside of the pancake gooey which is more like a dessert than a traditional pancake.... so we're not complaining! :)

Because their portions are so big - so hard to try different things - so I guess we'll just have to keep coming back to try different dishes!!

OH - and our server - wish I caught his name... was a HOOT - and so patient with us as one of the girls likes her coffee HOT... so he heated up her cup and poured fresh HOT coffee each time! :)

First, let me say that this restaurant proudly represents what Vegas stands for. The food is big..Huge... And ultra...  I mean ULTRA tasty. When I draft a review, I comment on 3 areas: Food, service, and price. 

The service was decent... Above average, but not over the top. The servers we experienced were attentive and friendly. Some were rather unique looking but hey, that's Vegas. One thing I liked was that everyone we talked to acted as if they were happy and proud to work there. I like that! The atmosphere was very casual and the place was a bustling with activity. I was happy and comfortable.

The food....WOW...the food.  OK, it took me quite some time to decide what to order.  Everything on the menu looked good!  So did the plates of food I saw passing by!  I ended up ordering the fried chicken benedict...a Man vs. Food favorite.  It did not disappoint.  In one word: Unbelievable.  This place prides themselves on twisted farm food.  The portions were HUGE and the taste was outstanding!  My girl ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake.  It was the size of a medium pizza!  It tasted so good that you would need to sit down to eat it.  This is simply no joke.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try other things on the menu.  If you are in a party of 4, I would highly recommend ordering 3 totally different breakfasts and then sharing them.  This would allow you to try different things and you would in no way be short on food.  This restaurant definitely did deliver in every sense of the word.  BOOYAH!

The price was amazingly reasonable for Vegas.  It was priced similar to IHOP but with all the huge portions and pizazz of a meal you cant get just anywhere.  For the two of us it was 28 dollars with drinks!  We did order too much food though as neither of us could finish.  My taste buds wanted more but my stomach simply couldn't handle another bite!

I came here on a Saturday night to sample this popular gourmet taco shop. I stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead décor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.

The menu is divided into five sections:

Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet Taquetzin
Street Tacos
Gourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl 
Gourmet Corn - Quesadillas
Lonches

I ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or beans inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. The burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!

All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.

Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!

Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas.

I got there around 6pm and the place was pretty much totally packed, with a wait. However, they have a very tiny bar with a few chairs, so I was able to grab a spot there.

Parking was a bit stressful. There are only a small handful of spots in front of the building. The nearby neighborhood does allow free parking but some of the locals seem to have put up their own ""no parking"" spots in front of their house, so the neighborhood seems a little less than friendly.

The menu itself features a wide array of tacos, including some great fish options (I had a shark taco which was quite good). They also have some typical street tacos such as carne asada. The highlight may actually be their salsa bar, which features over a dozen unique different salsa flavors (there are some typical flavor and then some strange ones like peanut, cilantro, etc.). But beware, almost all of them are pretty spicy! The chips are pretty standard, but having such a wide array of salsa choices (and the ability to just go get them yourself whenever you want) really makes it a great experience.

My favorite part of the meal may have actually been the horchata. I have had tons of horchata in my life, but La Santisima features a very unique combination that includes real chopped fruit. It was very refreshing, and the portion size is a huge 32 oz.

All in all, this was a great meal. It is definitely worth trying to find a parking spot (and waiting for a table)!",3,0,2,"""La Santisima""",,"""1919 N 16th St""",Phoenix,AZ,85006,33.469201,-112.047393,4.0,1694,1,Vegetarian;Nightlife;Mexican;Bars;Vegan;Restaurants;Breakfast & Brunch;Cafes

First of all, the place is tiny inside. We had a 15 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon which was a little annoying, but also proved that they aren't lacking in business. The worst part is that there is literally no where to stand. So we kind of tucked our bodies into a corner and tried to stay out of the way. That was kind of awkward. I was surprised that this was a sit-down restaurant. I was really expecting an order-at-the-counter type of place. In fact, I still think that would've probably worked better. 

Once we got our table, we were brought a complimentary basket of chips and a tall bottle of water to fill our own cups with. I like that the chips are free (especially since they have all the delicious salsa options), but I was disappointed that you get charged for chips after the first basket. We ordered the guacamole to go with all the salsas and were pleasantly surprised. My husband makes guac at our house all the time and I'm a bit partial to his, so I was excited to try such a refreshing, different take on guacamole. Pretty tasty! 

For our main course, I ordered the veggie quesadilla and my man ordered the bean and cheese burrito. Both were delicious! I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the fact that the quesadillas are fried, but the amazing cheese made up for it. I was worried that I wouldn't have enough cheese with all the veggies they stuffed inside, but I was so very wrong. I seriously could not get enough of that cheese! I am craving more right now...

I guess one of the downsides to this little place is the fact that it is so packed inside. We literally were just a few inches away from the table next to us (and the guy nextdoor was so annoying!). They also only had two servers scurrying between all the tables so the service was not the greatest. We had to wait awhile for drink refills and the check which was a little disappointing.

Rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us.

My girlfriends review is right below mine. Her name is Karen. Although it is very detailed and accurate. I'll add a few things. 

She gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than I was.

We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.

I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.


I ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie. As usual the portions are humongous. 

Both items arrived piping hot. All of this is good but again I found the food to be only satisfactory. It'll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough. The presentation is terrific. ....... but again I just don't fell the urge to have to visit this place again.

I'd recommend other places before recommending this place.

The check was around $60.00..

Again we had a overall satisfactory experience. Good and hot food. Friendly staff. Clean environment.

Something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars.",2,0,0,"""Hash House A Go Go""",Westside,"""6800 W Sahara Ave""",Las Vegas,NV,89146,36.144667,-115.239955,4.0,3050,1,Restaurants;Breakfast & Brunch;American (New)

I have tried to find a better way to describe the restaurant in one word, but that keeps coming to mind.  I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and the menu is definitely interesting, but I was put off by the staff.  

In particular, I strongly disliked my server.  I'm trying not to be overly critical out of spite, but sometimes it's difficult to disassociate a restaurant from the people they employ.  For starters, I get it they are going for a particular ""vibe"" with their front of the house staff, hiring people with an edgy look - but my guy gave me pause to wonder if he even cared about his hygiene.  

He struck me as snooty, which strikes me as ironic given the identity of the restaurant.  One thing that stuck out for me is two out of our four received our food, then a third came a couple minutes later, then the fourth in our party received his food seven minutes after the original drop off.  I actually looked at my watch and timed it. 

When questioned why the food didn't arrive all at the same time, our server let us know with a huff that they don't use heat lamps.  Like, how stupid am I?  I should be grateful that our food is coming out like this because they are way too clever to use a fundamental kitchen appliance that almost every other restaurant utilizes to ensure even service.  

So, while it might be nice that my food didn't get a bit dried out under the heat lamp, it wasn't so great that it got cold because I didn't want to be rude and eat while a member of my party had not received his food yet.

They serve big portions so don't come here unless you plan on eating - a lot. Otherwise, it's a terrible waste of food. I hope they are part of a food composting program.

The Boston Hash special, which had potatoes and peppers topped with a big Maryland blue crab cake and a spicy remoulade sauce, was a different combination. The crab flavor came through, but was a bit mushy. The scrambled eggs were good and not rubbery. It also came with a very good biscuit. The corned beef hash was simpler than the Boston hash with long strings of beef mixed with cheese on top of potatoes. It also came with the same scrambled eggs and big biscuit.

This is not an old school diner, but an updated version. For example, I had a very nice tangerine juice. Divey diners don't serve fresh juice - let alone tangerines. But let's be clear, it's still diner food. I think customers are overly fascinated with the portion size and ignoring the quality of the food. Take the Boston Hash I had. It had a soft crab cake, soft potatoes, soft peppers, soft eggs, and a soft biscuit. If a texturally-challenged dish like this was served at a Michelin-starred restaurant, it would get ripped apart by unhappy customers as being mushy baby food.

I was tempted to order their 1-pound burger. But hey, it's ONE POUND! That's ridiculous.

The location does not serve it justice since it is outside of the hustle and bustle of the strip; but it was great overall. The Peach Italian soda was to die for and I was savoring every drop. Hash House's decor was industrial, but quaint at the same time. 

The portions are huge!! I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Hardwood Smoked Bacon Waffles, and its not the plain meal you may expect. Three pieces of juicy chicken breasts sitting on top of two Bacon Belgian waffles. All of it is anchored with a steak knife and drizzled with a spicy maple syrup.

This past weekend we were in Vegas for a friend's wedding and were pleasantly surprised to find out the owners opened location in the City of Sin. 

After taking a Zantac 75 pill, we headed over to the area to settle in and wait a good 45 minutes for a table for 2. Patience is key here friends; this location apparently has been on Man Vs Food (which I'm not familiar with) and some other food network shows. 

I had the Watermelon Kiwi Cooler which was beautiful to behold and deliciously refreshing to drink! 
I have a sensitive stomach so I decided to go easy and order the Blueberry Pecan Flapjacks with two bacon strips and eggs over easy. The pancake, as M put it, was bigger than his head! hehe... 

Damn was that pancake good although I only finished about 20% of it. M had the Basic or Original Breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham and potatoes. Still GIGANTIC for a mere $8.95 price tag. 

Our server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! I took my dear Flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan. 

I would recommend going at least ONCE to check this place out. The decor is fun, the servers wearing great outfits and the food spot on. Yes, it is crowded and a bit crazy inside but the experience is worth it to see GIANT food. 

This place also reminds me of a now defunct restaurant in New York called Royal Canadian Pancake House that I used to go to in the early early 90's... anyone remember or been there?

Each slice is about $5-$6. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious.

If you're cunning enough to find this place, then you definitely deserve the pizza that they serve. Lucky for you, it's not that hard to find. 

Clues:
Third floor of the cosmopolitan.
If you see the pool table, you're getting close. 
Hallway lined with album covers. 

This little place only offers about five seats, but guests can grab a seat outside where the pool table is. It also has a pinball machine and an arcade game. Something to keep you busy if there is a wait. 

Slices are about 3 to 4 dollars, and are decently sized. There wasn't too much sauce on it, which I fully appreciate. And the sausage was good, and had a bit of kick to it.

Its a thin crust pizza with the perfect cheesy flavor the sausage are legit sausage slices and not the kind from dominos. The normal red pizza is also really good too and typically they have more options for it available. 

It tastes extra good after you're done doing your business at marquee and have those drunchies. But the line is pretty long because everyone from the club goes there after.

However, in comparison to most of what I've tasted around Vegas, this pizza is pretty damn good. And after all these reviews, it's clear that many visitors agree. 

I have to agree with others that the idea of the ""secret"" pizza is pretty cute. My husband and I were quite excited at the challenge of finding this sneaky spot. It's true that there's no sign to be found and it's down a random hallway in a random spot of the Cosmopolitan. However, it's clearly not much of a secret anymore and with the hints other Yelpers gave before me, my husband and I found its ""secret"" location in about two seconds. That was a little bit of a let down. Maybe to keep things spicy, Secret Pizza should move its location around. I realize this may not be the most practical idea, but it certainly would keep customers on their toes! ;)

I'll keep this simple since the gazillions of reviews have already said what needs to be said. The pizza is good. It's not gourmet and it's not incredible, but it's good. I'm sure it's especially good if you're drunk and ready to feed the craving. Unfortunately, like every other Vegas place, the prices here are a bit steep. $24 for four slices of pizza!

Mirage spending a lot marketing this show; you can see a huge Beatle Love Logo from their Hotel.  After all, they invest like 100 millions in innovation the stage.  These stages used to be the iconic Siegfried & Roy Magic show with the white lions and tigers.   One of the big cost of the new stage is in fact all 2,000 seat have an individual speakers placed in the back.  That feature help bring the sound balance in all seats.  In addition, the stage can be open and close just like other Cirque du Soleil, except no water in this one.  However, a lot of perfume foggy effect, and many high-tech lighting systems.

The entrance to the show was nicely done; it felt like you walk to an upscale nightclub.  The show is a lot more about the music, is really the heart and souls of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobat performers.  Performer of all ages were part of the show, some stunts does not look like it had any safety strap despite been like over 100 feet in the air.  The best act I think was the Come Together, that act was flawless it require perfect timing between several performer. That song was a great fit of the act.  Not every act was excellent, but there more than a few dozen would wow you.

This is my first time watching Cirque Du Soleli, and I am definite a fan of them.  Looking forward to see the famous water show like O and Le Reve.

When you walk in, you'll be wondering if you Can't Buy Me a better seat, as the large see through curtains that drop from the high ceiling to the stage are going to obstruct your view (they drop away in the first act, after which I Feel Fine). 

The staging, which is ""in the round"", is unique and creative - seating was offered for half price, and the front area of the theater is colorful and really gives the 1960s Beatles vibe. I'd say don't change anything here - Let It Be. We got our Ticket to Ride and entered the theater With A Little Help From My Friends.

Some of the scenes in ""Love"" are really overly confusing and have just too much going on, and just make you say Hello Goodbye. You may find yourself saying ""Whiskey Foxtrot Tango?"" in some scenes. (Almost like being Back In The USSR).   

And much of the amazing acrobatics that Cirque shows are known for are gone from this production, and in its place is just generic dancing, running fast, and facial expressions. 

But on the other hand, when they get it right, it's so right.  The sun made out of candles for ""Here comes the Sun"", featuring rope climbers, was perfection, and beautiful.  The aerialists and performers in simple white that were involved in the production of ""Something in the Way She Moves"" were so spot on perfect, that it brought a tear to my eye.  Outstanding.

Unfortunately, the scenes that were chaotic and confusing seemed really out of place.  I guess you can say they didn't Come Together. The ushers were hit and miss (one was really rude, but he probably had a Hard Day's Night), and you might find a few favorites missing if you are a big Beatles fan.

If you've been doing your homework and studying Yelp for your upcoming Las Vegas vacation, you've probably read through several different Cirque shows by now. It's true that every Cirque show is different- KA is very intense, Zumanity is very sexual, and The Beatles show? The best way to describe The Beatles Cirque show is a non stop party- eye popping entertainment- action all over the stage at all times- a splash of audience participation and a whole lot PEACE and LOVE!

All of the characters are filled with life, the scenes are energetic and alive, and you'll be singing along with the Beatles songs all night long.

I don't want to spoil any of the show for you, but I assure you this is one of the best Cirques in town. I advise you to purchase tickets from Tix4Tonight or straight from the Mirage the day of the show. I purchased great seats in section 104 for 35% off the day of the show, and it was totally worth it- just ask them if they have discounted seats available!

It's been 2.5 years since I saw it twice in the same week. I was afraid it might have lost a little something since then. I mean, I used to listen to the soundtrack daily in my car and may have worn myself out on it. But moments into the performance, those fears were allayed. The heart and soul of LOVE is the wonderful soundscape that George and Giles Martin have crafted. That part is evidently timeless and it still translates magically to the stage.

This time around, I managed to get front row seats. To be honest, I think I prefer to watch the show from higher up. It's not that being so close is a bad thing; it's just different. In the front row, your eye level is just above the stage. The show is a trip to begin with, but looking up and being so close to the performers exacerbates that feeling. At the same time, you probably miss a lot of things with your view occasionally obstructed. But with so much going on, this is true no matter where you sit. The important thing for me is that my friend absolutely loved it. Outside of my Dad, she's the biggest Beatles fan I know and it was just ridiculous that she had never seen the show.

An hour in and I quite frankly was ready for the show to finish up. I didn't find the acrobatics flowing smoothly while suspended above.  Let's chat about the children in the white masks, creepy.

The entire row behind us- yes, empty. Yet, we had two people seated right next to us.  
Indeed we inquired about spreading out a bit- absolutely not we were told.  What prompted our question was the man directly to our right spoke the entire show. Nope, not in a whisper regular speaking tone.  Heard his every word Perfectly clear over the music.  I gave him a stare down a few times and yes!  I made mention about him speaking. He clearly had the me, me, me syndrome. As did his wife, her shoes were off (no socks) and she had them hanging over the seats in front of her.  I heard more of him than the show!

For Beatles fans and non-fans alike, the show reflects our nations youth across a few decades.

- Remastered music.
- Talented cast.
- Well thought out integration of music and visuals.
- Expensive for front row.
- Comfortable seats.

While on a memorial trip to Vegas with my wife and uncle, Cirque du Soleil makes a sure bet for a memorable trip. I have seen many Cirque du Soleil shows in the past and they all differ in their own way. LOVE helped bring back some Beatles nostalgia for my uncle and provided a unique performance for the audience.

Sitting in the front row is a good idea 90% of the time with Cirque du Soleil shows and worked out well in this case. I scored the tickets from the fan club, well under the going rate and it amplified the experience being so close. Characters practically sit on your lap and do front-flips like you're the only person in the audience.

With Cirque du Soleil LOVE, the audience honors the musical legacy of the Beatles through remastered recordings, special visits from the iconic band members, and fictional characters pulled right from the songs.You'll find yourself watching Sgt. Pepper who encounters many familiar faces, including Lucy in the Sky, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna and Mr. Kite. 

The unconstrained story of the Beatles starts at the Blitz, moves through the band's founding, climb into superstardom, and their break-up. Using the master tapes at Abbey Road studios, they have created a unique soundscape of The Beatles music for LOVE.

I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. 

The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.

Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the ""older"" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. 

Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. 

On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.

Bellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day.

Can't believe I booked 6 nights here.  What a waste of my time.

The room only had a old CRT TV.  And the internet is not included.  $19 per day.

The pool was cool,... but the water was not very well heated compared to other hotels like the Encore for example.  And they don't have free bottled water there, just a fountain.

The casino itself is very crowded.  The staff not very friendly most of the time.  And they look like they distain you if you don't gamble with $25 or $100 chips.

Sure Steve Wynn went on to bigger and arguably better things at the Wynn and Encore. But when it comes to classic styling, the Bellagio takes the crown.

There are several reasons why the Bellagio still tops my list. One huge reason is the awesome fountain display out front. It's easily the best free entertainment we have on the strip. Whenever I have friends visit from out of town, I always recommend they catch a show or two. My favorite, hands down, is Con Te Partiro (Time to Say Goodbye), but anything from Frank Sinatra satiates my appetite for dancing water. Heck, I'll even take some Celine.

I have also stayed in one of their suites. This was years ago right after Ocean's 11 came out. Some friends were intent on experiencing the Vegas depicted in the film and pretty much showed up to the front desk and paid for the room. It's one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. I've seen the suites at the Venetian and Palazzo and they are very nice too, but there's just something about the Bellagio.

Don't forget the always changing Conservatory and it's seasonal botanical garden display. They don't seem to change it out as often as they used to, but it's always worth checking out.

Of course, you also have the hand-blown glass flowers that adorn the ceiling of the foyer. I didn't fully appreciate them when I first saw them, but they've grown on me. Just the amount of work that went into all that art - it's truly amazing. In fact, that was the reason I went there today and consequently, that's pretty much the reason why I'm writing this review. I snapped a pic for my daily photo blog and I needed an excuse to share it here on Yelp.

Sure other strip hotels have outdone the Bellagio. Sure it's no longer the place to be on the strip. But class never goes out of style.

The Good Things:
We had a fountain view on the 23rd floor for $159 per night. I felt that was a good price for the view we had. The view was wonderful! We really enjoyed tuning into the TV station to watch the fountain and listen to the accompanying music. The room was nice but not over the top opulent like the Venetian. 

Housekeeping staff was very nice. I like getting chocolates at bedtime.

Coconut gelato at the gelato shop on the way to the pool--FANTASTIC. Yes, it's $7.50 but it was actually worth it.

Lots of shade around the pool. Plenty of chairs\/loungers.

The Bad Things:
On Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights the disco over at the Paris Casino is so loud it actually shook our windows and thumped in our room until 3:30 a.m. We complained at the front desk but the response was ""there is nothing we can do about it."" It is incredible that the city of Las Vegas allows that much noise. Really, this is a shame because the fountain\/lake view is so nice.

Front desk staff smiles but basically they do not really do anything special or try to accommodate. The other couple we traveled with thought they had booked a handicapped lake view room. Unfortunately, that didn't exist; all handicapped rooms look over the pool. She wanted to view both rooms to decide which to pick and it was almost impossible for the hotel to accommdate this.

There's nothing cheap to eat there. We had lunch at a crepe shop and each savory crepe was about $13 and barely filled with anything. We ended up eating at other casinos. Actually, right across the street at Paris is a fantastic bistro with outside seating.

Way too much smoke in the casino and lobby area. 

Lobby & casino too crowded--you are always bumping into people.

Overall:
To me the conservatory isn't that special but I know it's a big attraction for most. 
The hotel lobby is jam packed, the casino is jam packed...it's just so crowded.

Checking in to the Bellagio is a pain in the butt, it takes forever!  I'm not sure why, but given that it is the only bad part of the visit, I am easily able to look past it.  

The interior décor is enchanting.  The lobby is always whimsical and the garden area in front of the Bellagio Café changes to different creative themes nearly every time I'm there.  I always stay in the Spa Tower, so I can't speak for Casino tower but the rooms are very nice, updated, and the housekeeping staff does a great job making the room spot less day after day.  I also like the turndown service at night, who doesn't like the chocolates that appear in the room, yum!

The dining options available at this hotel tend to be more upscale, so if you're looking for a more casual location you will probably want to go elsewhere.  I do like the night time bar options, there are many different atmospheres and most people will be able to find one they enjoy.

I booked a suite at the Bellagio and checked-in in their exclusive lounge. The lounge was pretty and the lady that checked me in was nice enough, but she was working at the speed of slow. She was banging on the keyboard like she was writing a dissertation -- what on earth would you need to type into a computer to check a person in? 

After checking in, we walked to the suite and we very pleased with it, the room looked great, the view was spectacular.... until a member of my party stepped on a broken needle. We called down to complain and to get housekeeping to come re-vacuum the room since we had kids with us. Some guy in a red suite came up to take an incidence report, and when he asked if there was anything he could do for us, we asked for some room slippers. To which he told us that this was house keeping's duties and we were to call house keeping directly. Really?  Passing the buck like that? 

I had also asked for a roll-away that never showed up, I called again before leaving for dinner and was assured that it would be taken care of. When I returned at midnight, it wasn't around and I had to call  a 3rd time -- the person answering actually said ""oh it hasn't been taken cared of yet?"".

We love Bellagio for several reasons, and they all showed themselves during this recent stay: 

1) Breakfast buffet, which is the BEST breakfast buffet I've ever seen, is only $18.99. That is one of the best-kept secrets on the strip. Even at Bellagio, you're going to pay at least $18 for a decent roll at Yellowtail. 

2) The game floor is simply organized and very comfortable. during our entire weekend, we only heard ""insanely fat screaming craps winning guy"" one time. The rest of the time was chill, because honestly most Bellagio guests could not possibly care any less about losing money.

3) Outstanding rooms. Bellagio is the best bang for your buck. At the end of a long, stinky day in Vegas, it's so wonderful to see that stone walk-in shower, and, this is one of the few Vegas hotels I've enjoyed where the climate control actually works right.

4) Service. From the front desk to the towel girls at the pool, Bellagio does service well. It's a travesty there are idiots on this Web site that would rate this place one star because he couldn't get his stupid handbag charged to his room bill. It's really, really sad. But in good news, attention to detail is NOTICED. Look at the pic of what they gave my baby, for example. Cute!

With any 5-star hotels, the service at the check-in is crucial because it is the first impression (based on interaction) guests get of the hotel staff.  I felt like I was checking into a Holiday Inn; it was very casual and unimportant.  

When I got into the hotel room, there was a red stain on one of the blankets and so they came up to remove it from the room and said that they will replace it tomorrow (why the wait? I have no idea).  It took 3 staff members to take the blanket away and they didn't address the concern of cleanliness at all.  I gotta say that I'm surprised to see this listed as one of the 5-star hotels because it is only a 4-star in my book.

Th check in lines take forever. We got in line about 1pm and it took nearly an hour until we were able to check in. 

The hotel hallways are very elegant, but the rooms could use major upgrades. I think I liked the bathroom better than the room itself. The major plus is that we had a lake view room which faced the Bellagio Fountains. I loved waking up to the view of the fountains and the view of all the other hotels. There is a channel on the TV that you can turn to so that you can listen to the music that is being played on the street level. 

Keep in mind, this is not a modern day hotel room. Bellagio wants to keep their hotel looking elegant and European. The bathroom has a seperate tub and step in shower. There is a mini bar and fridge stocked up but of course, the prices are steep. The lady at check in warned me not to open the fridge or else it would charge us! We were able to snag a complimentary mini fridge to be put in our room. Go over across the street to the ABC Store in Planet Hollywood to stock up on some water, enery drinks and alcohol.

I appreciated the box of Bellagio chocolates that were given to us. The chocolates were so delicious!

Some of the staff were pretty snotty and rude to us on some occasions. One of the cocktail waitresses never asked us if we wanted a drink but gladly asked the guys next to us. Why? Because they had hundreds of dollars in their machine. 

And when I went down to the front desk to ask for our free passes to The Bank nightclub, the lady at the front desk rudly told me that the concierge was closed for the night and that they didn't have any passes to give to us.

 The conservatory is a must see, which is to say if you havnt seen it, you must! Be ready though, cant take two steps in there in the evening on the weekends without ruining someone picture. So be creative (since youre going to be in them anyway) 

The conservatory is changed for several seasons - chinese new year, spring summer\/4th of July , autumn, Cmas.  

The water show is a great free attraction and is best seen from the dead center, in front of the hotel on the strip. (Although the bestest view is from any of the middle suites (the big round ones with the balconies on both sides of the living room).  Show is every 30 min (i think) at night.

To the left of the hotel, under the giant sign is the moving sidewalk. So you can take a break and ride in. Drops you off near the front entrance. Youll just be an escalator ride away from the front doors and the Petrossian Bar and that umbrella sculpture thing.

The pool area is very nice but its just a pool. That is to say its not a lazy river (MGM) or a giant wavepool (Mandalay Bay) just a pool. Kind of a disappointment  there.

Hotel security did a grand job of cocooning him and moving him away from the crazed fans and those of us just trying to check in.  That was the start of our 10th anniversary trip to Las Vegas.

I loved the button on the bedside table that controlled the curtains.  Super cool!  The linens on the bed were sumptuous.  The bathroom was very large and the shower was big enough for 5 (we only tried the two of us).  The velocity of which the water came out of the showerhead was that of a fire hose.  It rinsed my long hair in record time.  I loved that shower and miss it daily.  The pool - wow!  It is really a treat especially when you rent a cabana.

We've stayed at the Bellagio on three other occasions since the 10-year anniversary, most recently for our 15th.  There are a few of the same restaurants; quite a few have changed out.  Next time I'm there (hopefully this summer) I'll make an effort to try a few of them.

On the plane ride home after our first stay at the Bellagio, my husband looked at me and said ""we can't ever stay anywhere else when we go to Vegas, huh?""  I gave him the ""you gotta be kidding me"" look and then smiled.  I've stayed at other hotels since our first Bellagio experience with girlfriends and constantly compare each hotel with the Bellagio.  As far as I'm concerned, none of them come close.

We'd booked a room with two queen beds, thinking we'd be able to double up. We'd made the reservations and payed through Expedia at least two months prior. Upon check-in, Alisa at the front desk tells us we booked a room with one bed.

We pull out the Expedia confirmation and show her. Puzzled for a moment, she then chirps back, ""Oh, that's just a request. Until payment, Bellagio is not obligated to honor such requests from third parties."" The thing is, we already HAD paid for both nights of our stay, two months ago!! We tell her this and show her on the confirmation. At which responds, ""Oh, well, all our two-bed rooms are booked for tonight. If you like, you can check back tomorrow and see if we have one available for the second night."" (Meaning: you call us; we definitely don't care enough to call you.)

It's not JUST that we booked (AND PAID FOR!!!) a double room and received a single. It's that Alisa was quite obviously trying to pacify us by lying to us. First, she said we'd booked a room with one bed; then she says we haven't paid; finally, she tells us there are no more rooms of the type we've already paid for, even though the reservation and payment was made over two months in advance.

Ultimately, we had to squeeze three adults into a bed, with one on a roll-away. Moreover, our supposedly non-smoking room always smelled noticeably of cigarette smoke. (None of us are smokers.)

My favorite place to dine inside the Bellagio is Yellowtail. It is located near the valet on Flamingo Rd. There are other amazing dining opportunities all throughout the hotel. There is also a great bakery over by the shopping area where all the flowers are.

The rooms and suites are amazing. They have great views of the Westside of the Valley and of the Strip. The food from room service is better than many of the restaurants that I have eaten at on the Strip.

They have an amazing fountain and light show at night that you can view from the strip or from any of the surrounding area.

The casino itself if very large and they have a very nice high limit room with a very comfortable high limit lounge. There are also a couple of nightlife Venus to choose from.

- Bouchon French Toast ($12) - I feel like this name is a misnomer for this dish. It's definitely more like a cinnamon apple custard bread pudding.

Food: so delicious! I always have to eat here whenever i am in Vegas or Yountville. Always comes out with fresh warm epi bread and butter. Crispy Pork Belly salad was so delicious. Beef bourguignon was so tender. Dessert was so irresistible. 

Liquor: ordered a bottle of burgundy. hot dayam its expensive but so good - complemented the food. 

Decor: Nice high ceilings. Booths\/tables are not so close together so there is alot of walking room.

Service: SO GREAT! waiters, busboys will always keep your water and wine glass filled. They have knowledge of all the items on the  menu and the wine list. Just a reminder that it will take awhile between your courses since they want you to enjoy the company your with and talk and savor your food. If you are in a rush - dont go here.

The high prices for what is, at best, Olive Garden quality fare is ridiculous. The food takes ages to arrive. Plus, you may still end up seated next to Vegas a-holes. The only upside is that the servers are friendly and attentive.

Long version: So my girlfriend, two female colleagues, and I were in Vegas for a conference. We're trying to figure out where to get dinner, and we finally end up at Bouchon. It's a celebrity-chef restaurant in The Venetian. The decor is impressive. The prices are high. The menu is written to get you excited about the food. We were expecting amazing things. The many people on the waitstaff were extremely friendly, so we were even more expectant. We asked that our food - entrees, apps, and sides - be served at the same time. It took 45 minutes for the meal to arrive. And it was so disappointing.

The onion soup and white sausage entree were good, nothing terrible, but for an affected, overpriced French ""bistro"" from a celebrity chef, I was expecting much better than Olive Garden level. Both my colleagues said their main dishes were pretty good but nothing to brag about. One of them also got a side order of $7 ""pomme frites."" They were plain, bland French fries. The fries at Smashburger put these to shame, for God's sake. My gf got the worst of it. The roasted squash was soggy on top and hard\/undercooked on the bottom, and bland all over. The fried zucchini blossoms were inedible oil-sponges. She literally didn't eat them. The salade de tomate was swimming in vinaigrette.

Then, to add insult to injury, a group of five arrogant dudes and one skank in their late 20s came in. Where do you think they got seated? As far away from all other human beings as possible? Nope. Right next to us. And I do mean ""right next."" There was hardly any space at all between their table and ours. Tip to the Bouchon hostesses: when a pack of a-hole guys comes in, don't seat them next to a table with three attractive women and one guy. I knew these guys were d-bags the second I saw them, and I was right. They kept staring over, and sure enough, as predicted, one of the scumbags couldn't resist making a loud, inappropriate comment directed at one of the women at our table. Naturally, this p-ssy never, ever would've done that if he had been there by himself, but surrounded by his fellow scum he was brave.

Leading up to the event, the thing I was most excited about after the chance to revel in wordsmithery was being able to return to Bouchon, this time with the husband in tow (which meant I had semi-control over ordering two meals, not just one, which we would then split in whatever fashion I deemed acceptable).

He got the breakfast jardiniere (eggs, brioche toast, potatoes lyonnaise, spinach, fruit, juice, tea, and a pastry -- we got chocolate almond croissant).  I got the brioche french toast and a side of corned beef hash (not on the menu, but they'll make you whatever you ask for here, within reason -- it was $8.50 in case you're curious) and a coffee. 

Everything was great. Eggs cooked perfectly, toast light and fluffy, spinach buttery and rich, potatoes well-crisped (and also buttery and rich). The french toast was quite rich and sweet - I definitely wouldn't have been able to eat a whole serving, but about 40% of the serving was perfect for me. The corned beef was well-seasoned and savory, the potatoes were small cubes, well-crisped -- I'm not sure that the two married perfectly, as I think the potatoes were a little too crispy to integrate just right into the meat, but I still ate all of it. The chocolate almond croissant was crazy good. I have read this recipe in the cookbook, and all the steps that go into making it, and now I can see why it's all worth all that work. If there's an almond or chocolate almond croissant on the specials menu when you're there, get it. 

Service was smooth early on, though it got a little slower as the place filled up (it was surprisingly full by 830am on a Friday), and we got someone else's toast delivered to us, so he went toast-less for longer than he probably should have until they figured it out.

Any average bistro in France will serve at least as good as this if not better for half the cost. O.k. so we are not in France so you have to pay extra, which I don't mind but it should be really, really good if I'm going to plunk down $38 for an entree and no sides.

First about the food...
We shared the grilled octopus salad, which was very nice. It was the best dish of the evening. The octopus was tender and mild, accompanied with some citrus sauce, rocket, and various peppers and pickled peppers.

My husband had the flat iron steak and fries. I had read rave reviews of the fries but it turns out they are just fries. They remind me of In & Out. We have a local bistro that has much better fries. The steak was good, cooked to order, with carmelized onion puree and some chive butter. Good but not spectacular.

I had the leg of lamb with escarole. Leg of lamb is a pretty big hunk of meat but this presentation was very thin medallions of lamb--about 8 small bites of meat. Yes, it was nice but nothing special. The escarole was fine, and it had about 1\/4 cup of tasteless quinoa. I would have much preferred rich, creamy mashed potatoes. The highlight of the dish was the Hen of the Woods mushroom--fantastic! I would have ditched the lamb and rather had a plate of those.

We were so unimpressed that we decided to go without dessert. Ironically, it was our anniversary and the reservationist asked if it was a special occassion, which we said it was, and the matre d and waiter both gave congratulations but actually, that was the end of it. Have you ever been to any kind of restaurant that asks you if it is a special occassion and then does nothing? Not even a stupid chocolate-covered strawberry. For those prices and that hype, you would expect a little something when you are paying $175 for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine. Why bother to ask? 

The good thing is that we have always contemplated going to the French Laundry but this changed our mind. It would pain me too much to pay $600 and be disappointed.

Corned Beef Hash...paled in comparison to the C&W and the generous pile of french fries that came with the CM. However, it was fantastic as ""leftovers"" that we were able to snack on several hours later in our hotel room. Did not require neither heating up nor utensils.

Their high level of customer service is benchmark to others on the Vegas Strip. Accommodations were excellent. (I was on the 40th floor.)  If you're a seasoned traveler the view of the golf course is most relaxing vs. the Strip view. What a great place to stay!!!

The Wynn Buffet is still The Best Buffet in Vegas - the variety of food, preparation and the environment, all were excellent. (Outstanding rack of lamb, veal and 5 different ceviches. All could stand alone at any fine dining establishment and this is their buffet!) Don't forget to get the bar drink menu.  They have an unlimited ""sparkling wine\/champagne and\/or mimosas deal for $10. available all the time not just at brunch. A GREAT VALUE.

The Tryst nightclub is one of the best in town. DJ Spider was there performing (he's a Chicago regular at places such as Sub51) Groups of attractive women usually no cover charge. Men on the other hand $$. Drinks $10 - $16. Bottle service $500+ (There are deals to be had if arrangements are made in advance...birthdays, bachelorette parties etc.) Check it out!

Le Reve - the Dream at the Wynn Theater was a fantastic production. Simply amazing 75 minute show.

The location of this hotel is opposite the Fashion Show Mall. During my stay they were having the Miss America Show inside but showing the competition on the ""Jumbo-tron"" on the front of the mall.  Not bad!

The man and I wanted to check out this gorgeous hotel. It is gorgeous and we enjoyed walking around and taking in all the sites. Since we were new to the casino, we decided to sign up for their promotions card called RED which was toting sign up and get $10.00 worth of free slot play.

So, many of you know I am a girl who plays poker and other live action games. I do not typically play slots, but if I do, there is one type of slot I will play (Jackpot Party) and I will do the $0.25 draw poker machines. I decided to put $20 into a draw poker machine, bet the max $1.25 and kept hitting small stuff. My guy was off at another machine and when he finally found me (20 minutes later), and sat down next to me, I was about $40.00 up. Next thing I know, bam, I hit a royal flush and win the jackpot for the day which was about $1,100.00. Talk about fun luck! I then took that $10.00 free slot play to the Jackpot Party machine, put in their $10.00 and a $20.00 bill of mine and ended up cashing out of the $.05 machine for $230.00! 

Long story short, I came home with just as much money as I left for Vegas with and I paid for all of our tips, taxis and misc. stuff with other winnings.

The economy being as it has been, we took 4 long years before we returned to Las Vegas.  We started our gambling at the Bellagio and it was as lovely as I remembered.  We went to the Wynn with excitement....but it didn't last.

The video blackjack machines were not setup to double down or split.  We were told that we could turn on our service light and a floor manager would come to reset them.  (This is actually something we've done many times before at both hotels).  Normally, it takes just a few minutes to get service.  This time, it took 25 minutes (and we saw 3 managers walk right by).

Do what I did - tag along to your rich younger brother's birthday bash at the WYNN. Being the baller that he is, he checked out one Standard Room, one Tower Suite, and...wait for it...:

1. Problems with temperature control. The hallways are either stifling or freezing.
2. They need a monorail from the rooms to the casino. We were honestly discouraged from going down to gamble because of the Long Mile to and from our ""Villa.""
3. Couldn't find a decent meal. The room service was awful. Really bad. Someone ordered a breakfast pizza. With 9 people there, it went uneaten. And I already Yelped about Bartolotta's. Worst $300 spent yet.

Anyway, it's a brilliant use of space. It's splashy without being theme-y. The drunk douche bag factor is way low. The service is so good you have to keep pinching yourself.

This hotel is simply amazing! Their Tower Suites have their own exclusive check-in counter separate from the General check-in, a private escorted entrance, and a well-trained staff who will cater to your every need and treat you like a royalty.

Right when you enter the exclusive entrance to the Tower Suites, you automatically marvel at the lavish decor and drool over the luxurious designs while you are greeted by a cheerful staff who opens the door to the entrance of the check-in stand.  The counter rarely have any wait and you are instantly offered drinks--bottled water or cocktails and a nice cold or warm (depending on the season) hand towel to freshen you up and soothe you from your long drive or flight.  A true celebrity treatment!  So different from the General check-in stand where normally there is a wait.  After check-in, an attendant walks you to the exclusive elevator and provides you with instructions and directions to your room.  The Tower Suites are floors 60 and above of The Wynn Hotel.  The rooms have breath-taking  views of the strip and loaded with amenities apart from the norm such as TV in the bathroom, phone next to the toilet, bar filled with snacks and drinks, remote controlled curtains, luxury plush mattress and pillows, multi-level spray spa shower head, jacuzzi, complementary Wi-Fi with IT customer service for people like me who are tech-challenged, fax machine, and many more.  The rooms are on the pricey side, which ranges from $450 to $3,000 per night (depending on room size and dates you check-in), but it is worth every penny!  When you stay at The Tower Suites, you have full access to their Concierge who are able to book your dining, spa, show, club, golf, and casino reservations both for Wynn and Encore.  You can also take full advantage of their beautiful and magnificent resort with multi-floor pools free of charge.  As an ordinary guest, you get charge $50\/day for resort fees, but if you stay at the The Tower Suites, those charges are waived.

The interior decor all throughout the hotel is simply marvelous! I totally love every detail of it.  The waterfalls are spectacular and a must-see! It's perfect to have a cup of coffee or cocktail drink at one of their restaurant, bar, or coffee shop spread-out around the hotel and marvel about the dazzling beauty of the falls.  The shops in the hotel are top-of-the-line designer boutiques (Chanel, Dior, Alexander McQueen, Rolex, etc.). The service everywhere in the hotel is first class! You get royalty treatment everywhere you go. Wynn Las Vegas is also filled with the most notable and acclaimed restaurants in Las Vegas from fine dining to casual and even vegan ( for complete list and see more photos: http:\/\/www.wynnlasvegas.com\/Restaurants).

The rooms are modern and very nice, with LCD TV and upscale materials.  Got to watch out for the snack bar.  They charged me for something I didn't take.  Took a while to clear that up.

Location is not as central - next nice casino is about 10~15 minutes walking distance away.

I like the pool the most - it's 3 pools in line connected by a narrow 'stream', so you can swim straight for a long time.  They have free, iced bottled waters.
The buffet here is excellect - better than Bellagio's (similar food variety, much better quality)

As for the casino: I like the slots.  As some have mentioned, the table minimums are very high.  You can find the cheaper $40 tables, but those maybe the ones with the machine card sorters, which I don't like.   Someone on the craps table was playing with about $1\/2 million worth of chips - rows of white $5000 chips!?

I don't know how they got my info because it showed up at my parent's house under my maiden name- I'm celebrating my 2nd anniversary and I've been in AZ for almost that long so it was weird- but I they offered 2 Le Reve tickets, a free meal for 2 at The Buffet, and an amazing room at a great price so I was happy to book a visit.

We booked it at the beginning of summer so when we found out the fight was going to be on the same weekend we were a little anxious about it. We had specifically chosen this weekend because rates were the lowest which I figured would translate into bookings also being the lowest of the season. Nevertheless, we kept our reservations and were determined to stay in the hotel to avoid the crowds once we parked. We spent an entire weekend in the Wynn and there was never a dull moment. 

We also didn't end up spending half as much as I thought we would on alcohol because their alcohol policy is very relaxed. You can bring alcohol into the pool area (just no glass), into Le Reve, and into the restaurants. We ended up getting a pitcher (equal to 5 drinks) at the pool because what is a vacation without a pina colada and I didn't have a blender to make one myself and it was only $60 which was great for Vegas drink prices. The pools were great, there were a ton of them and even with all of the people from the fight, there was plenty of room. Some of the guests were belligerent, but the staff handled it well and it was expected since that is the type of clientele fights attract to Vegas.

My only complaint is the security deposit that the hotel took out was a bit insane. I had put the hotel charge on my debit card without thinking and the deposit was equal to the hotel cost so it felt like getting double charged and when checking in there was no mention on the security deposit (I was ready for the taxes, resort fees, and the room cost, but there was nothing about that charge). It was reversed as soon as I checked out, but it was a shock. I think that might just be a Vegas thing because I haven't had a hotel do that to me anywhere else before and when I mentioned it to a friend they told me that they always noticed that in Vegas.

I recommend downloading the Wynn app while you stay there and to take advantage of the Concierge. Also see Le Reve! It was absolutely breath-taking! My husband was never the show going person until I started dragging him to Circ du Soleil shows when we started dating and even still he only goes in exchange for us going to a sports game, but he was just as entertained and fascinated by this show as I was. Allegro is a great restaurant we enjoyed next to the Le Reve Showroom and there are plenty of onsite dinning options.

When you are spending a good amount of money service is key and the service here is 1st class. Impeccable service all around (even the bathroom attendants), except the check-in lines, but there is a bar to order drinks while you wait..

Amazing selection of tier one restaurants (Tableau, Alex, SW and Chocolat). Tryst night club is both impressive (two story waterfall, dancing inside\/outside) and filled with good times - not a single incident or complete idiot found (ya know the kind trying to rub up on your girl).

Awesome pool and spa - not over crowded and few kids. Gambling poolside, nice fluffy towels and  misters for the really hot days.

I upgraded to a parlor suite room in the tower suites. Pretty sweet! It's 1280 ft.² and it has a bathroom bigger than my first apartment. I chose a room overlooking the Strip. It's beautiful. You can see the mountains, and at night, you can see the lights of Las Vegas really clearly. 

The room cost a fortune. I really never would've paid face value for this thing, but I managed to talk the front desk into letting me upgrade. It really does pay to join the Wynn insider club. I think that they take you a little more seriously. At least they figure you'll be coming back, they don't want you to be unhappy.

The room has everything. All the way from a fax machine to a really fancy toothbrush. And seriously the views can't be beat. I had a whole bunch of attorneys here for a cocktail party in the living room and there was plenty of room.

If you are not spending your money or if money is really not an object, this is a really nice way to live. They really do treat you very, very, very well.

I make several trips to Las Vegas a year for work and I have stayed at many of the other casinos.  I had heard from many people that it was by far the best in Las Vegas.

It is not the best, but it is pretty good.  The guest rooms are large.  They are laid out quite well.  My room gave me a great view down the strip.  The floor to ceiling windows is a nice touch.  The rooms are nicely appointed through out.

The bathrooms are large.  I always enjoy the small flat screen television in the bathroom.  Several hotels do this now, but the television in my bathroom was loud enough for me to hear it while showering.  That simple fact made me happy.

The reason I did not give the Wynn five stars is the choice of patterns and colors.  I find them quite tacky.  I know I am in the minority in this, but I find the decor at the Venetian & Palazzo quite nicer.  The carpet in the hallways is brutal.

I am not a gambler so I can not say much to that.  There are several great food options.  Parking is easy.  I found a spot quickly and had a short walk to the guest room elevators.

I have many friends that always go the cheap route and stay at scary places like Excalibur and Luxor.  Trust me on this.  Spend the extra money and stay at a good hotel\/casino.  There are many to choose from.  Treat yourself to the Wynn, Venetian or Bellagio at least once.  Depending on your tastes one of those will be perfect for you.

The rooms? Pretty disappointing. We stayed in a basic room at the Wynn- I was intrigued that they brag about how the room took five years to design, but I think most of that time was spent at the craps tables, because there were some fairly shocking basic design flaws. 

First of all, the toilet part of the bathroom is dark, and paneled in dark wood. If you like the feeling that you are peeing in a 1970s closet, you're all  set here. 

There is no easy way to turn off the lights from the bed, which, I'm sorry, should be illegal.

Rented a movie, which kept switching on and off- almost like a bandwidth overload was occurring. Quite infuriating, given the price tag. 

Small details overlooked: the towels were the roughest, oldest pieces of sandpaper I've ever encountered in a hotel, there is no coffee machine or even free water, no fridge- so forget about bringing home that leftover for later- and even the housekeeping was spotty. They forgot to remove used towels that were clearly left out for them every single day. 

You seem to get nickeled and dimed here quite a bit. Room service was polite, but the $20 continental breakfast fails to mention that you are getting miniature pastries, not full size ones. Don't let the minimalist zen packaging on the toiletries fool you either- check the ingredients on the same products in the gift shop- they are full of petrochemicals and parabens- very cheap ingredients.  I understand charging to use spa facilities, but asking someone to pay $20 a day for a run on the treadmill? Internet at $14 a day? Cheap!!

Also, the pool is blocked from the sun after about 2 pm. Not a problem in August, I imagine, but it was the #1 complaint I heard on the elevators. 

These may seem like little details, but this is meant to be one of best hotels on the strip. If I was staying at a Ramada, I wouldn't complain, but at these prices, I expect a little luxury, or at least decent towels. I have stayed at the MGM Signature previously for about the same price, and was expecting the same quality- in almost every aspect, this place lacked the class, style and basic luxuries that place offered.

That all said, the view was great, the grounds gorgeous, and the champagne brunch fantastic. Le Reve is the most incredible show on the planet, and I liked that valet parking was free. Also, don't miss the 25 cent wheel of fortune slots- they seem to hit regularly!

Arrival and check in were relatively easy. The taxi\/Uber drop off point is fairly close to check-in. That is not always the case in Las Vegas so it is a nice plus. The line at check-in moved fairly well and the process moved at a decent pace too.

There are plenty of elevators which helps. The appearance once you are off the elevator is lacking though. It feels like you are in a parking garage. The hallway leading to our room were in ok shape, but there was some miscellaneous garbage like a beer can scattered about. Not a crazy amount, but enough to notice. Especially since the beer can was still there the next time we went to our room.

The sleeping area of the room looks ok in passing. The decor has been updated in the last few years I would assume. I do appreciate there is no carpet, as the general lack of cleanliness in other areas would lead me to believe carpet would have been filthy. There is a good amount of space and a lot of windows. We had a decent view of the High Roller. One of the lamps was not working and the outlets were not conveniently located.

The bathroom was a different story. It looks as though it has not been updated since the casino was built. On top of that it looked and felt a little dirty. Everything was in working order at least.

We did not eat at any of the restaurants, so I cannot speak to them. That being said, none of them sounded like anything we wanted to try either. The casino area is ok. There are plenty of tables, including plenty of low minimum tables.

This casino is in a good location on the strip. It is near the center so you can access most of the other casinos fairly easily. It tends to have a decent price so that can be tempting.

This hotel is OLD, DIRTY, and POOR!! I booked a room through hotels.com and thought I got a really good deal for a hotel literally in the CENTER of the strip. I was a tad hesitant when I got the room because so many people had mix reviews... LET ME CLEAR IT UP JUST STAY AWAY!!!!!

When I arrived check in was quick and they let me check in 3 hours early and I was happy. I asked the lady for a remodeled room, but she said those would be an extra $30a night to upgrade, so I asked how are the standard DELUXE rooms she said they were nice, just like the pics on the internet, if so then i should be fine without the upgrade.......

I get to my room and was horrifield, it was SMELL; DIRTY, DARK AND UNINVITING!!!!!!! My 5 year old daughter said NO she did not want to stay here because she noticed dirty ashes from cigarettes still on the table. The room was worst than a motel. I'm talking the dirtyiest motel you can find! Imagine a room you see in those horror films in the middle of no where!

So I went back down and told them that they need to give me another room, now all of a sudden to upgrade to the infamous GO ROOM is $40, so I was like whatever this is false advertisemnt on the net, but give me the upgrade.

We get to the new room open the door and was like better, but STILL NOTCLEAN. THe beds were dirty and the carpet were gross there were sunflower seeds on the floor!. THe little lamps were literally hanging off the walls. At this point I was so tired and pissed that I was just like whatever... at least its better than the first room. THen I sat down to observe and the room started to look like a place where people come for ""cheap thrills"" the vinyl head boards and mirror thing on the ceiling and sillouette doors.

DONT LET THE PRETTY PICTURES FOOL YOU!! The hotel is not clean to the naked eye. Not even the upgraded GO rooms. Its still dirty. I would never stay here again, let alone come close to the place thenext time I am in Vegas. The staff was rude, especially front desK and housekeeping.

Okay Let's Break it Down with the Pros first:

Pros: 
-SO CHEAP. I paid $80 for two nights and three days
-small but it's a fun casino...won $240 whoo!
-new CRAPS machine just put in 3 days ago (there's not much pressure here where people dont stare at you and hoping you dont roll a 7...plus i always get scared of throwing the dice across the table and ending up hitting someone in the face..)
-the garden right outside the entrance to the hotel rooms....is BEAUTIFUL. there's a huge koi pond and the koi fish is HUGE. and of course there's flamingos!!


Cons:
-ghetto ass elevator (in the parking garage)..smells like pee
-elevator inside the hotel is okayyyy....not really a con. made me sick though
-blanket is not thick enough. looks like a regular sheet but a little thicker. and theres this other blanket that is made of fur and colored pink. kinda gross looking. reminds me of a dead flamingo on the bed or something

OMG! So my fiance and I woke up to a jackhammer at 7:45am this morning. I was pretty annoyed considering we drove 8 hours to get here and needed some much needed sleep. Called the front desk, the gal said said she was unaware of the situation and would contact someone to see whats going on. Lol oh ok...so then I decide to just be awake for the day.

About 30min later,  I flushed the toilet and the toilet begins to overflow causing the bathroom floor to be soaked in water. I call the front desk, maintenance guy comes and fixes it. The maintenance guy left me with a wet bathroom floor with probably god knows what on it. I guess he just expected me to go about the day with a wet floor? He could have at least called housekeeping or brought back towels. I heard on his radio that the A\/C was broken in 6 rooms..so he was busy, couldn't be that mad! So I am not going barefoot in the bathroom because I do not want to catch Aids. 

It's now 11:15am and the jackhammer is still going. Lol, I'm really trying to stay positive and but am thinking of staying somewhere else tonight. At least they can give me some type of comp or something for this crazy morning. Can't imagine if I was hungover, I'd be so pissed...but am trying to be a good sport about everything.

Moral of the story, invest your money in getting a better hotel. Cheap is not always better. Wish I would have paid the $250 to stay at the Cosmo or Cesars instead of paying $140 for 2 nights at the Flamingo.

They were doing some serious remodeling of the high limit gaming area, so there was some construction going on, and one of the bathrooms was down because of it. That was somewhat annoying.

If I was reviewing the casino as a whole, I'd probably go with only two stars. However, the poker room made it enjoyable for me. Sure, aesthetically it is not a great poker room. There are only a couple crappy TV's, the chairs are just mediocre, and sometimes there aren't too many games going. However, the frequency of drink service to the poker room is excellent. Also, the dealers are very friendly and I didn't witness a single dealer error during numerous sessions.

Even since I have been back, I still call the Flamingo home, even when I stay elsewhere. It's homey, kitschy charm with its high-class feel is always great.

The casino is one of my favorites as it is large, yet still small enough to manage, unlike some of the larger neighboring casinos. Plus, I've found it to be one of the best about comping drinks while you are playing.

As far as the hotel goes, it is pretty standard to most Vegas rooms: long twisting hallways that seem to never end, and few elevators. The attention from the staff made the stay even better though. We had an issue with the room the first night, and after calling the front desk, it was resolved immediately, making our stay a lot more care-free.

The location and price are what sets this location apart more so for me. You have all of the major casinos within a couple block walk, no need to take the tram or taxis.

However, I did consult these Yelp reviews before booking the Flamingo and because of that I booked the GO Room. I wanted to check out old Vegas and thought ""How bad can it be?""

Indeed. I have no idea what these reviewers are talking about with the rooms being dirty. Maybe the Flamingo has made some changes, but the room we had was seriously nothing short of amazing. It's probably the nicest room I have ever stayed in. Really. 

It could just be the proletariat in me, though.

You can't compare the Flamingo to Aria or Cosmo because you can't get a room for that price in those places. You can't say you don't like a movie theatre, so you're going to the OPERA next time because one of those things is not the same price as the other. I know it is difficult for rich people to understand that things cost different amounts... but if you can afford a suite in the Cosmopolitan then don't cheap out and stay at the Flamingo and then become all enraged when there is no water for your pomeranian in the room. If you want a fancy hotel, go pay a fancy fee.

You get what you pay for and unlike some other casinos I have stayed in, the Flamingo was worth every cent. Then again, I'm not all rich and fancy. And I don't have a fancy pomeranian. It's because I'm poor and I don't know how to live my life. And I have a dog allergy. I'll never be able to afford a suite at the Cosmo, though, so for me the Flamingo is as good as it gets. WOW I DON'T EVEN FEEL DEPRIVED AT ALL!

There was a long line to check in and out. There was also a comparable line checking into the Paris. I'm not saying lines are cool, just that if you can't afford some kind of presidential VIP welcoming party I don't think you can do much about the whole ""waiting in line"" thing that happens in life and stuff. Luckily, when we got to the front of the line the guy at the counter was totally excellent and upgraded us to a suite even though he could tell we weren't all upper class by our flip flops and non-designer sunglasses. His awesomeness more than made up for that line that makes you ponder your lot in life as a non-celebrity.

You can't expect fancy parking at an old Vegas hotel, they did things different when this place was built... which is basically what I think makes the Flamingo rock my face off. I would rather have a fancy place for me to stay than my car, but I am used to parking my car in shady places since I'm so low class and all. Naturally, fancy people will be absolutely infuriated by the fact that the red carpet doesn't reach into the parking lot of inconvenience. If you have given your rich-person driver the day off and the limo is in the shop you can always use the valet, although I know it is hard to surrender your Astin Martin to one of the great unwashed service industry people.

We thought that the walls were thin when we woke up the morning after and heard a ton of music, but it was from the pool. The pool that makes staying at the Flamingo completely worth it! The birds, the greenery, everything was so cool! Even if the hotel was just average, it would still be worth staying here just for the pool. Of course, if you sleep wearing a blindfold on a pillow made of satin I can see how this would be totally bothersome. And I know flamingos aren't that impressive to see when you eat one for dinner every Saturday with a side of caviar or something. But normal people think it's pretty cool.

Overall, I think the Flamingo is worth the risk. I don't think you can go wrong with the GO room from what I saw, and with that level of coolness I don't see how much lower than average the other rooms can possibly be. Worst case scenario the room is a little dirty and you spend your whole stay in the pool anyway.

DO NOT stay at the Flamingo! It was the worst experience I had with a hotel. 

Casino: WAY too smokey. There was barley and ventilation so I was constantly coughing because of the smoke.

My husband made the mistake of walking down the hall in his socks to get ice.  He stepped in a PUDDLE in the carpet!  Torn carpet literally ""fixed"" with duct tape.  (To be fair, not all of the duct tape was silver.  Some of it was maroon to blend in with the 80s maroon-colored carpet). we made a reservation for a non-smoking room, but when we checked into our room it smelled badly of cigarette smoke. The TV options were barely even basic cable.  I love being able to watch movies in the room, but that wasn't even an option in this room.
The pool is nice, especially if you rent a cabana for shade, but about 12noon every day a techno-DJ starts blasting music at the pool.  It's so loud for the rest of the day that we left the pool at the end of the day hoarse from having to yell to hear each other.
There are really aggressive time share salespeople all over the lobby.  That doesn't usually bother me, but one day I started having a really bad eye allergy out at the pool.  By the time I walked inside to the lobby from the pool to get eye drops from our room, my eyes were completely swollen shut and I could barely see (super attractive).  Despite clearly having some kind of medical issue happening, one of these time share sales man started following me and pestering me to hear his spiel.  (I'm also in sales, so I'm usually pretty receptive to a good sales pitch, but my eyes felt like they were on fire and I had to get to my room to get eye drops!).

I almost never I try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality, taste and preparation. The Buffet at the Bellagio is one of those exceptions; in fact it by far surpasses any buffet I have ever found. 

Here you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. 

Now the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long.

The first time one of my bridesmaids and my fiancée did breakfast the day of my wedding. The service at this time was amazing!

The second time we went for brunch the following day with a group of 10; just some friends and family who wanted to get together for good food. First off the lady who was seating us wasn't very pleasant. She was very confused by our party size and acted like it never happens. She kept saying ""4 at one table, 4 at another"" she didn't speak very good English so trying to explain that her math included only 8 when our party was 10 was another ordeal. She was very concerned about the 18% gratuity for larger groups when we already said that wasn't an issue. We had already been waiting about 40 minutes while she ran around confused and inspected our tickets to get in. She left our 10th party member behind the rope because she clearly couldn't count to ten for most of this time. When we finally got in and seated our server was very nice and attentive.

It was awesome to be able to come down from our room, in desperate need of coffee and not have to walk a long ways or take a taxi to get it! That requires too much effort in the morning!

There is an omelet station that has a large variety of toppings, including crab and shrimp!  Yum!  Other hot choices include eggs benedict, lovely bacon, sausages, several potato dishes, waffles, pancakes, french toast, breakfast burrito bar, and many other options.  There was a large variety of fruits, cereals, salads, yogurts, pastries, etc.  Many lovely desserts.  The quality of all the  food we had was quite good.

This place is mobbed, but the second day we were seated in a side dining room, which was much more quiet and less chaotic.

the variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.

another shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.

i went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  

Most of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel....  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! 

The flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!!

This go around, I had the chicken pho. The chicken was cut up into thin slices of white meat which was a bit chewy. The broth was pretty much a fail with very little flavor. At 8 or 9 bucks for this bowl of noodle soup, I definitely expected better. And since my food was unsatisfying, I took a few bites off of a friend's fried rice. That  was too oily for my taste.

What I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!

I always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty.

You can tell how they divided the tables and one side were the drunk leftovers from the club. The smaller side were just regular people ready to dine. I went there after picking my girlfriends mom up from her late swing shift. We get there around 4 AM. No crowd but the security guard actually seats us which was fine. 

We sit down and were given menus. My girlfriends mom waves to her coworker that also just got off work. We were finally given some water and looking at the menu and after about 10 minutes we are finally asked if we're ready and sadly we weren't. So he said ""Okay"" no customer service with a take your time yadiyadiya... just left. Then comes this solo diner that sits next to us. After about 5 minutes of him waiting he was upset and walked over to the security guard. Security guards asked if he would like to start with appetizers. Guy replies ""no I just want to order, number 13"" blam.  Done deal. He places the order and security guard comes back to us asking if We'd like ""fast"" appetizers and sorry for the wait because they're back up... which is believable but.. I know for a fact they weren't. The same guys that were ready to take our order saw us. We figured okay maybe they think we're still pondering our great options at pho kim long. No we want pho homie. It's simple. Surpringly our spring rolls came out just minutes after ordering. At the same time our solo diner already had his food but tells the server ""you guys forgot my drink and napkin"".. they didn't apologize because they knew they didn't want to serve him as it seemed he was a ""regular""

We sat there with our empty plates and half empty glasses of water. The guy who supposedly wanted to take our order then starts to clean up the table that was next to ours and the girlfriends mothers coworkers said a peep and he walked over, placed there order. Right after that the solo diner was done he paid and left. Before we even had a chance to order. The guy cleans up and another guy basically asked how much and he said zero. And the employees seemed a bit off.

Now everything was cool it seemed fine until after our meal. Sure I can understand horrible service for people who always have to deal with drunk leftovers from the club... but you sat us on a side with regular people just waiting to dine. We asked for a to go box and the check. I work in the tipping industry and understand we should tip. At least. As for restaurant tipping I truly believe that is based on the customer service we received.. I felt like we didn't get any.. so do they deserve any? Sure. I gave them 3 dollars. I felt generous. I usually double the tax but for this I kept it as is. 

I walk up to the cashier and pay with card. He rips off the first receipt and says it very bluntly ""choose one"" and circles the tipping options and stares at me. I say ""no thank you I already tipped you cash."" So he immediately steps back and calls on the ""radio"" which was clipped to his shirt but says very loudly where the restaurant can hear ""get the money from table 6"" and the guy responds ""Okay I got It"" cashier responds ""What?"" And no longer using their little walkie talkies they said 3. And everyone was like ""THREE?!"" I didn't realize it at the time because I spent an hour waiting for food it was 5 am. I was tired and ready to go home. It was just completely rude. 

If they wanted a generous tip they should have given top notch customer service to sober people versus kissing ass to a bunch of drunk idiots who more than likely gave them a stiff. It's a common spot to go here and I've never experienced customer service like this before. Only quality thing they had there was security.. so if you want late night food\/pho with a high chance to see a fight(why else is there a security guard at a restaurant) go to pho kim long.
