Norburn,0/1,4.0,1156896000,"Unflinching, uncompromising - and yes, a little preachy","This is one of those rare books that isn't necessarily a pleasure to read but is definitely worth reading. Orwell's novel manages to affect you long after you've read it - possibly even haunt you. It's a bleak novel (some might say downright depressing) - but it's also powerful and uncompromising.Over 50 years have passed since 1984 was published (the year itself came and went over 20 years ago) yet this novel is still relevant today. 1984 is a remarkably ambitious work; unflinching and perceptive. Orwell isn't just telling a story though; he is using this novel as a soap box to warn us all of the dangers of totalitarian governments.1984 is a novel about big ideas; about the machinery of totalitarian governments and how people can be manipulated and controlled by those in power. I did find however that the characters weren't as developed as I would have liked, as if Orwell felt they were a secondary consideration. As a result, I found the novel lacked a personal quality that I think would have made it all the more compelling. Winston Smith is not an especially sympathetic character (or for that matter, all that memorable a character). What is memorable about 1984 is the world Orwell creates - a world of contradiction, oppression, and betrayal.This is not a book that will bring a smile to your face. Its message is delivered with a heavy hand but 1984 will make you think. If it doesn't make you paranoid, it should at least make you cynical."

Yau ""Voracious reader""",2/3,4.0,1073088000,1984 or 2004?,"Eric Blair's 1984 is not only his finest work but also one of the most influential and provocative books of our time. The work obviates to us to full actuality how the world had evolved for the worse during the dark period from 1932 to 1949. Winston Smith and O'Brien are the most important characters whose keystone dialogue raises alert for the prospect of human future.Prophecy or Caution?While we might prefer to interpret ""1984"" as a precautionary tale or some social warning, bloodshed, warfare, massive torture and murder, not to mention Stalin's cruelty, the Nazi mechanized techniques of organized massacre, the Cambodian, the Iranian and the Iraqi, the North Korean, and all the other countless horrors, have inevitably to a certain degree changed ""1984"" from caution to warning, further elevating the work to a 20th century prophecy.Despair about Future of ManA sense of hopelessness about the future of man hovers over the book. In a way ""1984"" is an expression of such a hopeless mood about the bleak future of man. It warns readers that unless the course of history (and leaderships) changes men all over the world will forfeit most of their human qualities and become soulless automatons without being aware of the depravity.In the Winston Smith-O'Brien dialogue, ""Imagine a boot stamping on the human face-forever"" might have exaggerated the current state of human soulness. The 20th century history has confirmed and fulfilled dehumanized practices as mentioned in ""1984"" like 24/7 surveillance of all sounds, activities, and conversations; deprivation of freedom of speech, penitence for thought crime and wiping out of existence and memory and thus forfeiting any way to make appeal to future. For example, a Party member lived from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he was alone he could never be sure he was alone. Wherever he may be, he could be inspected without warning and without knowing that he was being inspected.The Party tacitly encouraged prostitution as such outlets for instincts that could not be altogether suppressed. This unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members in order to remove all pleasure from sexual act. Even to his wife, a Party member was expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. A real romantic love affair was all it took to crumple the Party. Desire was deemed thought crime, which entailed death.The Party saw that it was not infallible and that all its belief rested on the omnipotent Big Brother. It therefore called for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts-alteration of the past and rewrite of history in order to wipe out existence of certain human beings and historical facts. It was not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases accurate. It was also that no change of doctrine or in political alignment could ever be admitted. Whatever the Party held to be truth was truth. It was impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.Notwithstanding the Party contrived to have its way and imbued the belief in people, how could the Party control people's memory? The Party had wiped out most of the older generation during the great purges and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender (sounds familiar like the Chinese Cultural Revolution?) When memory failed and written records were falsified, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.""1984"" is meant to be read as a warning, an exhortation, and not so much prophesy. However exaggerated and haunting the negative utopia is being depicted, the book is a startling work of an imaginary world that is convincing. 4.0 stars.2004 (4)"

7,9562910334,1984,,A3JD07VHDLT5FF,"isala ""Isabel and Lars""",5/7,5.0,1089504000,A warning that has not been heeded,"Orwell wanted to warn his readers about the danger of totalitarian regimes. The promises of the fascist and nazi ideologies had misled millions and thrown the world into the ravages of the second world war. Stalinist Soviet Union was seen by many as a model state. Orwell knew far too well what was hidden beneath the promises of security, bread, and jobs for all.1984 has become a household name as few other books; who does not know about Big Brother, or the Thought Police, nowadays? Even the title has become a catchphrase. I do not know any other cult-book that has been so thoroughly ripped apart by other famous authors; I remember Isaac Asimov thrashing it in the nineteen-eighties for instance. Many seem to believe that the society described by Orwell is an impossibility. The problem with the book is that Orwell thought his society would be a product of revolutions. When instead, in reality, the changes creep upon us. A new law here, a small change to statutes there.The most obvious paralell to the book we have now is, of course, the war on terror. We have from top officials that it is going to go on for a long time, and that it is, essentially, unwinable. Readers of 1984 of course recognize the eternal war described in the book. Another paralell is how history changes; Winston Smith's job is to rewrite history so that it suits the present situation. Don't we recognize that? In the ninetenn-eighties, Iraq was our ally; now, Iraq has always been our enemy. Thought Police, I need not even mention this; the administration knows everything about us, and is prepared to use it.We even have paralells to the Anti-Sex movement! The list can just go on.Orwell's book was a cry for reason in the aftermath of a world gone mad. As with so many other cries for reason it disappears among the siren calls of our leaders.I first read it over twenty years ago, in a different world; it was good then - it should be essential reading now!"

10,9562910334,1984,,A20RHRHAZ2YE1G,Chris Florian,1/1,5.0,1016582400,1984 Review,"...1984 is about totalitarianism. It is about a society ruled by a dictator named Big Brother. The thought police carefully scrutinize everyone in the society. They arrest you if you show signs of rebellion or dangerous behavior. Everyone is under constant observation by devices called telescreens; devices that are like two way TVs. One of the points of their society is to make everybody the same. They are working to destroy all things that are individual about people. They also destroy all evidence about the past. They invent and change events so that they are made to look good. They have abolished marriage in the common meaning of the word. You may only get married if you do not have any interest in the person. The main Character, Winston, questions this society. He longs for a time in which people had freedom. He starts a journal, a crime punishable with death, about the things he feels is wrong with the society. He meets a woman named Julia and they begin a secret affair. They find hideaways in the woods and go there separately because if they are seen too often together the thought police will get curious and investigate. They get a room over an antique shop in a poor neighborhood and use that to meet in. Eventually they meet up with a man named O'Brien who asks them to join the brotherhood, an anti Big Brother organization. O'Brien turns out to be a member of the thought police in disguise and they are arrested. They are tortured and made to confess everything. When they are released, they have no strong feelings for each other anymore and are for the rule of Big Brother.I think the significance of this story is to bring to attention the dangers of dictatorships. What Orwell did with his novel was create a hypothetical situation representing what could come if we are not careful. This book was written at a very tumultuous time in history where there were many emerging dictators. This book is Orwell's warning to society."

Pynchon's voice has been, since ""Gravity's Rainbow"" almost the inheritance of 1984; as a dislocation of the predictiveness of the Orwellian text, it also has functioned as a panacea to this nightmare we live on, precisely because Pynchon's language doesn't allow for any concreteness.

In it we find bland descriptions choreographed with a rhythmic, powerful force of language and an internalized graphic depiction of a mind on the brink of rebellion.It is false to claim that this is a 'probable future', as many of the issues and threats of the time of the prophecy have come and gone and been resolved by the evolution of society. But the meaning is lasting, regardless of your meaning of oppression.There tends to come a time in life when everyone feels oppressed, trapped by the state of the world and angered over their perceived restrictions. In the case of this novel the specifics of the dictatorship are agonizingly detailed, the interest maintained by Orewell's natural story-telling abilities and spectacular wit. But the meaning is meant to go deeper, filtering away the extremist exaggeration of the satirist and searching for clues in the muck of human nature.These issues are timeless and therefore the threat of 1984 will never likely go away. There will always be either a real or perceived oppressor and there will always be a basic human instinct to rebell. Nowhere is this principle more lucidly articulated than in 1984."

19,9562910334,1984,,A33FTIJPUKFPTK,Jeff,1/1,5.0,1101686400,1984,"1984 by George Orwell is an excellent novel that displays the possible horrors of a `utopian government'. The novel takes place in London, a large city in Oceania. The main character is Winston, and he is able to see the lies of The Party, which rules the nation.Throughout history, Oceania has been at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia. The Party uses censorship to revise history to make look as if Oceania has been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or vice versa. Winston is employed by The Party and his job is to change these past records.Along with censorship, The Party uses techniques like newspeak and doublethink to control the masses. Newspeak is an effort by the government to create a very simple language that is dull and not descriptive. This `lean' language is designed to minimize the brain use of Oceanians. Doublethink is another effort of The Party to control Oceanians. Doublethink is a technique taught by The Party that requires people to believe things that they know are not true. For instance, a citizen may know for a fact that Oceania was at war with Eastasia only a few years ago, even though The Party insists that Oceania is an ally of Eastasia and always has been.Winston begins to question the greatness of The Party when he sees how blindly some people can follow the party. This really struck Winston one day during the `two minutes hate', in which The Party shows enemies of Oceania on the telescreen, and all of the Oceanian citizens scream at the person on the screen. Winston is bothered by this, and gains a deep desire to `bring down Big Brother'.This book is an excellent read for people of all ages, and can show the dangers of government intervention into personal life."

23,9562910334,1984,,A2Y10DWNT2X4XB,Kevin Black,3/3,4.0,1168473600,Execellent book for Students of Philosophy and Politics,"I found Nineteen Eighty-Four to be genius in the respect that it is absolutely consistent, and original in some cases, in detailing the State's efforts in gaining total obedience from its victims. Most importantly, Orwell acknowledges the means of gaining unquestioned obedience: annihilating man's reason and independent thought, which in turn erodes his will to live by his own efforts. Despite some minor inconsistencies in the plot, Orwell's theme about man's struggle to live in a totalitarian state is an intense, emotional experience.Cleverly labeled concepts such Newspeak, Doublethink, Thoughtcrime, Sexcrime, etc, are an interrelated, systematic means of destroying man's ability to reason and observe existence objectively. Objectivity is the means of identifying and differentiating percepts from reality, which are then condensed into concepts. Without objectivity, concepts cannot be formed; without concepts, language is not possible. Big Brother recognizes this fact and works backwards by manipulating language to shape concept formation. The resulting oversimplification of concepts and ideas eventually leads people to question their observation and knowledge. How will one discern the real truth? By relying on an outside authority: the State.The obliteration of the mind is compounded day by day by the harsh, desolate environments and the endless repetition of propaganda. Dependence, anxiety, and helplessness soon replace independence, confidence, and strength. Students of philosophy will no doubt see the State's stance on gaining knowlegde, ethics and politics similar to that of Plato, St. Augustine, the Medieval Church, Calvin, Luther, Hegel, Marx, etc.Finally, Orwell states the real reason for gaining man's obedience: power for the sake of power. Orwell is consistent: Big Brother does not pay lip-service to man's supposed base and evil nature. No, the state wants obedience because it can take it. This is the politics of, as Ayn Rand once stated, ""might makes right.""Of minor point, there are some minor inconsistencies in the plot. One must ask the question: how can citizens/automatons, who are constantly conditioned to be totally intellectually and perceptually dependent on the State, run a quasi-technological industry by their own independent reason and actions? Despite this, the overall point of an omniscient and omnipotent State is understood.Nineteen Eight-four is an excellent book if one wants to observe the effects of the loss of independence and freedom on individuals. One noteworthy point: Orwell, an avowed socialist, indirectly attempts to distinguish socialism from communism or fascism. Throughout this work he demonstrates the essential need for objectivity and reason in man's life. Despite this, there is no objective reason to believe that man is his brother's keeper and that he must surrender the fruits of his labor under threat of government compulsion. History demonstrates socialism (government control of personal property) as the transitional period from some governmental controls to total control. Observe as evidence the fall of Rome to the Dark Ages, Czarist Russia to Soviet Russia, and Weimar Germany to Nazi Germany."

Although the advances in electronic music make this material sound dated now, it's still a highlight of Van Halen's career. Songs like ""Jump"" contain a pop element that gave 1984 mainstream appeal, and David Lee Roth turned the frontman role into an art form on songs such as ""Panama,"" ""Hot for Teacher,"" ""Drop Dead Legs,"" and ""I'll Wait."" To a large extent, it was 1984 that set the standard for '80s pop metal, and David Lee Roth who set the standard (or takes the blame, depending on your point of view) for the aggressively good-time attitude most pop-metal bands took for their own. --Genevieve Williams"

One constantlyforgot that Orwell was a man of the 1940s writing his view of what the world would be like in 1984. It was amazing to read Orwell's perception of the future in such vivid detail. This is the story of an entirely new world. Just as people thought that the world would become utter chaos in our far future, the year 2000, George Orwell believed that in his far future, 1984, there would only be three superstates in existence: Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania and the world would live under complete government control. ...The totalitarian government present in Orwell's novel is in many ways similar to those which have existed throughout history in Russia, China, Germany, etc. It is fascinating to think how Orwell was impacted by the events going on around him. This novel was the means by which George Orwell warned the nations of the possibility of complete loss of individualities and freedoms. 1984 screams to be read by all. It is a disturbing leap into the reality that these circumstances could come to be, but it is also a novel of great imagination and creativity and tells a story that one could never forget."

I want to be buried with this book...but this version leaves something to be desired.I recently purchased the Signet Classic paperback version, which is one of those taller (7 1/2"" X 4 1/4"") paperbacks that started appearing in recent years. I started reading it and noticed there was something subtly different about it. It turns out that my version has been altered. Words that originally had an English (British) spelling in the original, have now been Americanized. Just on the first page, coloured has been changed to colored; moustache to mustache and metre to meter.Now, to some people this may seem like a small thing. To me though, this is aggravating...possibly disturbing. Did the American publishers think that Americans aren't smart enough to read it with the English spelling of some words? The odd thing is that while they altered the British spelling, they left in words that are typically British like: flat (apartment) and lift (elevator)...and again these are just on the first page.To me this is akin to a British film that gets distributed in the US, then the US film distributor decides that they need to overdub a British actor's voice with an American's because they're worried your average Americans wouldn't understand the film.I have found out that there is a Penguin version offered that is the original un-dumbed down version.

Here he takes the concept a step farther with a breakdown of the government to become a flawed and highly controlling socialist society run by the political elite.This is a very interesting book that should be read along with the author's other book Animal Farm. I read the book and saw the VHS starring Hurt and Burton which is mostly a faithful representation of the book - and a good movie in color.Once the smoke and rhetoric clears this is essentially a love story about a man living in what appears to be a communist society or perhaps the National Socialists that has evolved into a tightly controlled and hero worshipping society, i.e.: pictures of the leader (""B.B."") big brother are omnipresent and everyone wears similar blue overalls, eats similar food, etc. Big brother has taken on a persona similar to Stalin or Mao and like those totalitarian communist societies, the misfits or independent thinkers or small business people are banished to camps or simply killed. Propaganda is the norm and (again) like similar 20th century communist countries history is re-written almost daily to reflect the current whims of the leaders.Unlike many imperfect countries including most western countries and other free countries that have survived the upheavals of the 20th century, we are subject to government propaganda and media bias but we are free to turn off our TV sets, not read the papers, buy any book that we so desire, have religious freedoms or free to be agnostics, and choose to protest and vote as we see fit. This is all lacking in 1984 where society is strictly controlled. Each TV is interactive and monitors the owner for deviations from the accepted patterns of behaviour; it is connected with the ""thought police"", and is turned on all the time to monitor the citizens. Only high party members have the luxury of turning off their interactive TV connected to the ""thought police"" and drinking wine and participating in the normally accepted pleasures of life. As we read in the book Animal Farm, the utopian ideals of a perfect society are replaced by the corruption brought on by absolute power.The ""average citizens"" including our hero in 1984 are subject to a continuous stream of propaganda about external armed conflicts, false production figures to offset real material shortages, criminal activities against big brother and the party, confessions of party members gone astray, etc. They cannot read independent books or articles. Such books, that would expose the government propaganda for what it is, are all banned. People who do not conform are routinely arrested and hung at public hangings - that are televised seemingly daily.The plot is sinister in that the ruling party members use thought control and torture to manipulate the masses including our hero, so the citizens lose most of their human qualities and are zombie like. This is a chilling movie about how a society can take a wrong turn.Written by George Orwell late in his short life, this remains a compelling and unusual read about a society gone mad. It is a ""must read"" work of 20th century fiction."

The world was already in fact, engulfed in a period of total warfare. (Many historians now consider WWI & WWII to be a single event - a first and second act, if you will, of the most deadly struggle in the history of the earth, with a cooling down period or intermission, in between...).Even WWII never actually resulted in any kind of resolution or conclusion, but rather, settled into an uneasy ""truce"" involving a new confrontation that rose out of the ashes of post-war Europe and Asia, between Soviet Russia, China, and their communist allies, and the United States, and (what remained) of western powers - namely, France & Britain.The events of Korea were looming large and the cold war was about to get very hot, played out on the stage of the Korean Penninsula. Framed as a ""UN intervention"" supporting South Korea against invasion from the North, the Korean war was less than a year away when ""1984"" was first published: an event that was nothing short of a direct military confrontation between the United States and China and the Soviet Union which nearly became WWIII.Moreover, a substantial percentage of the world's population was already under the direct control (China & USSR), or at the very least, the yoke (North Korea, Mongolia, Eastern Europe, etc.,) of oppressive, bloody supreme dictatorships led by cult-of-personality leaders in Mao and Stalin.Meanwhile, American Democracy faced its greatest crisis since the Civil War, during the Korean conflict. General MacArther - a figure beloved by the American people of an almost ""God-like"" status challenged President Truman by publicly advocating the use of nukes against China and escalating Korea into an all-out war with the Communists.In the ensuing showdown the American people and press sided with MacArthur, villainizing Truman. As we all know, MacArthur, dismissed by Truman, stepped down and peacefully abdicated his position. In retrospect, the wisdom of Truman's policy was obvious, but fortunatley for all the world, the maligned president, Truman - despite the frightening times - kept his sanity, stuck to his guns, and made the politically unpopular decision of keeping Korea an isolated conflict and standing up to MacArthur...If not for Truman (and MacArthur's decision to obey the Commander and Chief), it is frightening to imagaine just how close the world Orwell predicted could've come to fruition.Orwell's analysis and predictions of the fate of human nature, society, and politics contained in 1984 are absolutely piercing and frightening. This book should be required reading (where it isn't already) in U.S. high schools and universities (or for that matter, the world's educational institutions). Orwell teaches us, in shocking, disturbing prose, that the freedoms and liberties that we all take for so much granted everyday, are much more precarious than we presume. Indeed, at times, their fate hangs in the balance. The price of protecting freedom and liberty depends on nothing less than the eternal vigilance of an informed, invested, and educated populace.1984, in my opinion, stands as the most important novel written in the 20th Century."

The most similar book that I have read to it is actually Jihad Vs. McWorld. It is the first fiction book I have read that valued the importance of language and the &quot;Love impulse&quot;. This is seen even today in advertisements. The importance of the name Big Brother is that it is sononomus with the Christian Father and Son figure although not implicitly stated. Newspeak also culminates the impulse. In 1984 the characters follow the teachings of IngSoc, which by looking at it seems harmless but it a abreviation of English Socialism that can hold connotation's in peoples mind. The same techniques are used in modern government and consumerism. The story is also compelling, and shows both a triumph and a failure of love under certains circumstances."

As for comments made by another (American) reader, Orwell does not set out to somehow reveal a 'secret Communist agenda' and does not attempt to portray a Socialist government. Many references made throughout the novel actually highlight his opposition to fascism and the extreme right, after the devastation of World War II. While ultimately, Orwell successfully explores the impact of complete political control by a small elitist group over a general population, his work is deliberately politically non-specific. 1984 applies to a number of regimes based upon general terror, and not directly to Communism, which in many cases has arisen, and is sustained, through popular demand."

Winston, the hero of the novel, lives in a totalitarian government that has control over every aspect of his life. The government has made privacy obsolete and love a sin; therefore, making life for many people unlivable.But with the slogan ""Big Brother Is Watching You"" reigning over every wall and building, many people are far to afraid to speak out against this so called ""perfect"" government, in fears of loosing their life. Winston however, feels that as long as he is living under the rule on INGSOC (the official name of the government) he might as well be dead. So he looses his fears and slowly takes action against INGSOC. He falls in love and for the first time in his life he is truly happy. But everything that he is doing is against the law. The government views love as something that is dangerous to the party; therefore it must be destroyed. Ultimately the government turns out to be far more complex and powerful than anyone imagined.I am assuming that many people are reading this before they have actually read 1984. I will not reveal more because I do not want to ruin the plot for you. AlI can say is that it has a surprise ending that you would have never expected.1984 was written by George Orwell in 1949, yet its theme and ideas still holds true in many ways to today's world. That is one, out of many reasons, as to why 1984 will forever be a classic. Set in 1984, Orwell's depiction, of what was then considered the future, is both horrific and in some ways accurate to the governments of today.There is great deal of symbolism in this novel. I believe that Orwell's intention, as Goldings had been in Lord of the Flies, was to reveal the evil that drives people and to show how that evil is apparent even in today's modern societies. Orwell worded this book so eloquently that it is easy for almost anyone to pick up the symbolism.1984 was so eye opening for me, that after I read it I walked morbidly around the house just thinking about what ultimately happened to Winston. This book pulls everyone in because it has all the elements - drama, action, suspense, and romance. I only recommend this book to people that are at least in 6 grade. The reading isn't challenging, it is just the actual concepts about the goal of governments and human spirit that might be confusing. If you are the type of person that likes to get absorbed in a book, not just have a quick read, then this is the book for you. If you enjoy books such as Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, or The Giver, then 1984 will undoubtedly become a favorite."

What makes it compelling is the way in which it not only examines the human condition but also bludgeons it to a bloody pulp. So why have so many people enjoyed reading such a depressing story, ever since it's release in the late 1940's? I believe it to be the manner in which the novel blurs your ""in-built"" judgement of what is right and wrong, good and evil, in respect to civil liberties and the power of governing authorities. The way it inspires you to look behind the diplomacy and see the agenda. And the way it forces you to examine your own rationale for your assumptions and actions.

I've also been on a Utopia kick, reading books such as 'Brave New World,' 'Island,' and, of course, '1984'. In my opinion, it is a good story, but I am not very alarmed about Orwell's ominous predictions of the future. I mean...yes, the massive possibilities given us via the internet do seem to mirror those of the telescreen that always knows what Winston is doing, but I cannot forsee the decline of the human spirit. The book in itself begins interestingly enough, but by the middle, I was more interested in finding the switch to the reading light so I could drift off to sleep. There are about 20 pages that are very slow reading, but I was captivated by the last part (part 3). However, the ending left me with a very sour taste in my mouth, mainly because it is not the conclusion I would have picked; but that's kind of my point...I still have (&lt;---if I could use italics...ooo) my opinion, and Orwell has his.

And although the totalitarian planetary government in place in my story is much the same as Orwell described in his book, I believe I have described it's origins in greater detail. Many of the accepted practices in today's world lead to results very familiar to Orwell's readers. Such concepts as ""Newspeak"", ""Doublethink"", ""Thought Police"", and even ""Big Brother is Watching You"",are being implemented today by contemporary democratic societies, including the U.S. In addition, we now have increased security provisions caused by the war on terror that could result in a severe loss of freedom if left unchecked.

58,9562910334,1984,,,,2/2,5.0,936316800,One of the greatest 20th Century novels.,"Breathtaking, in one word. Compellingly written, with a chilling plotline which is familiar to virtually all: a terrifying vision of an authoritarian future. It doesn't matter that it didn't happen, or that the settings are stylised: the real undertows of emotion and concept are played out in your head. It may have drawn inspiration from contempary communism, but the true commentary is far deeper - freedom, compromised in any system, and the appearance of freedom. The beginning is monochrome (dull, as some have referred to it) because Orwell was crafting some of the finest textural novel-writing ever - the contrasts with Winston's violent mental rebellion, the freedom of his reckless affair and the dark, futile scenes in Minilov are there for a reason. The ending may be 'depressing' but it is also one of the most powerful and affecting conclusions devised. The courage to end this way is telling of Orwell's uncompromising artistic stance, and his deeper intentions behind the novel.Three things really stand out. Firstly, the interesting and intriguing conceptual work expertly weaved into the plotline. Orwell used both satire and philosophy to emphasise a single variable - control - in his fictional world. It's a gritty, naturalist way of working; rather than through elaborate symbolism, and Orwell's journalistic style shines through. Secondly, his portrayal of this world. Although repeated readings have bought out subtler tones eg.the proles, newspeak, my first reading was dominated by the overwhelmingly convincing tone of observation and everyday slavery. The opening section builds up to a great atmospheric crescendo. Finally, although I mention a lack of symbolism, 1984 stands as a symbol itself for all the great struggles of the individual. Within its pages are independence against control, love against adversity, the vivid against the mundane, freedom against propoganda and expression against conformity - perhaps even life versus death. (see the attitude of the Party towards death, both in regards to others and its own continued existence). In displaying Winston's will waged against fate and society, Orwell has created one of the great political fables, and a supremely human novel."

But for like-minded people, you will understand how powerful this book is from page one.The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because of the ending. I really felt it wasnt the right way to end this book. It just didnt seem to flow with the rest of the pages. I am a little disappointed that Orwell decided to finish this amazing novel with such a drawn-out, tired ending."

62,9562910334,1984,,ACQ2YU0CP68WC,Turiel,1/1,5.0,1182384000,The terror of 1984,"Thankfully in the year I was born which was 1984, the world wasn't exactly like it was in the novel.What makes 1984 important to the modern reader is several things.First is the fact that culturally its an incredibly relavent book. Most people have today heard terms like ""How 1984"", ""Orwellian"", or even ""doublethink"", in the modern vocab. Hell, even Radiohead did a song called 2+2=5. The reader, particularly the young one trying to grasp a sense of history, in the sense of the progression of modern thought, will find this book very important.That relates to the 2nd reason why you need 1984, not only is it culturally relavent in its influence and often referenced nature. But it is one of those books that have shaped the way that we think, particularly in the free market west, and has helped give us moral justification in avoiding what becomes the excessive totaltarian nature of many collectivist style government. Perhaps in Orwell's mind he may of been more successful then he orginally planed to be in his warning, as he was a english socialist, and was deathly afraid of what he had seen happen with Stalin in Russia.As a story, 1984 is a well thought out and griping story. The intergration of idea's, action, depth, and even a great deal of dark satire blend together well.Although it is a good idea if one does have at least a decent understanding of Marxism before approaching it, as i've seen younger people in my generation approach the novel without the understanding of Marx and walk away with little more comprehension of the tale's warnings then they could.Overall however, one of the few books everyone in our culture should at least attempt to read."
63,9562910334,1984,,,,22/42,4.0,1007424000,Proof that a must read is not necessarily a good read.,"Written in the late forties, Orwell's 1984 is clearly a product of its time; a time when the advent and eventual use of the atom bomb threatened the end of civilization. I admire Orwell for the amount of thought and imagination he must have put into the development of this book. It is an example of how a powerful imagination can teeter between extremes of pure optimism and, in this case, paranoia. In 1984, Orwell's vision of the future is grim: war is constant; freedom, as we know it, is an ancient and outdated concept; and love, for anything but government, is perverse. Winston, the book's protagonist, struggles with a lost sense of self and his fear of a government (the Party) that punishes the pursuit of individual fulfillment. Most disturbing is that, in the end, rather than die as a martyr, he embraces his oppressive government fully aware his capitulation will precipitate his own death.Orwell's commentary on the evolution of totalitarianism is profound. Orwell asserts that post-Neolithic governments, with the benefit of written history, were, over time, able to reduce the threat of overthrow using lessons learned by fallen predecessors. Orwell argues that throughout history people have been divided among high, middle and lower classes; and that, with the advancement of successive governments, the intent of the higher class to maintain power over the lower classes has become less explicit. This has left the lower classes less inclined to revolt. In 1984, the proletariat is under the illusion that their government represents their interest. The Party fosters this illusion, in part, by constantly ""updating"" any record of the past. As a result, people are unaware of how terrible their lives are relative to the lives of those who lived before them.Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it.Orwell's prose is not noticeably good or bad. The book's strength is in its power to make people think."
64,9562910334,1984,,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,Davewise,3/3,4.0,1211155200,Withstands the test of time,"Several concepts from ""1984"" - especially ""Big Brother"" - have been popular cultural references for many years. Despite being familiar with them long before reading the novel, I still found the novel to very engaging and entertaining. One easily identifies with Winston Smith, trapped in a brainwashed society and wanting to rebel, knowing things could be better. Instead of feeling dated, the story feels even more relevant today with the level of surveillance that governments across the globe exercise currently.Some elements such as doublethink may appear to be a bit far-fetched, but still remain scary because one can see a government seeking absolute and unending control going to any lengths to achieve their goal. Indeed, attempting to control people's thoughts isn't outside of the realm of possibility; it can almost seem like ""political correctness"" taken to an extreme. So while fans of science fiction and readers of almost any dystopian future story will be familiar with some of the concepts seen here, this is well worth a read, being both one of the earliest examples of the story and still one of the best."

What You Already Know,"Winston Smith, the main character in ""1984,"" says that ""the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know."" I had this very sensation as I read George Orwell's classic novel. Orwell speaks with a prophetic tone from the year 1949, with many of his comments on totalitarianism proving true during the Cold War and popping up under new guises in recent years.""1984"" tells the story of Winston Smith, a man employed by Big Brother. His job is to correct and effectively erase bits of history that don't line up with Big Brother, the Thought Police, and ""doublespeak."" Through this regime, the masses are controlled on all fronts, emotionally, intellectually, physically, even spiritually and sexually. Orwell takes us into this colorless world a step at a time, leading up to the horrifying realities of what happens to those who oppose Big Brother. Along the way, he lets Winston find love with Julia, but even they recognize that their love cannot be pure. He lets the two of them expand their revolutionary wings. And he lets them face the consequences.Orwell doesn't tell a tight, fast-paced story, at least not by modern standards. He is more interested in communicating ideas. But he does allow us to care for his characters. He gives us just enough time to connect with them, even though they themselves are already disconnected on many levels. They join the Brotherhood, a resistance movement, and in doing so get their hands on a book detailing the realities of Big Brother. Although ""1984"" is a rambling, sometimes loosely cobbled story, it is a fascinating manifesto on the dangers of governmental control and the age-old struggle of the High, the Middle, and the Low. It's amazing of accurate some of Orwell's observations still prove to be, but as Big Brother's slogan goes: Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past."" And: ""The heresy of heresies was common sense."" Or how about this? ""Stupidity was as important as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.""Personally, I am more frightened by the less totalitarian, more consumerism-driven ideas of Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" but ""1984"" is a classic for good reason, and it casts its shadow over many stories to come, including ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Minority Report."""

76,9562910334,1984,,A274ENGOQB11H9,Julie,127/138,5.0,888883200,The History Lesson You Wish you Had,"George Orwell's final novel, 1984, was written amidst the anti-communist hysteria of the cold war. But unlike Orwell's other famous political satire, Animal Farm, this novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race. When it was written, 1984 stood as a warning against the dangerous probabilities of communism. And now today, after communism has crumbled with the Berlin Wall; 1984 has come back to tell us a tale of mass media, data mining, and their harrowing consequences.It's 1984 in London, a city in the new &uuml;berstate of Oceania, which contains what was once England, Western Europe and North America. Our hero, Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth altering documents that contradict current government statements and opinions. Winston begins to remember the past that he has worked so hard to destroy, and turns against The Party. Even Winston's quiet, practically undetectable form of anarchism is dangerous in a world filled with thought police and the omnipresent two-way telescreen. He fears his inevitable capture and punishment, but feels no compulsion to change his ways.Winston's dismal observations about human nature are accompanied by the hope that good will triumph over evil; a hope that Orwell does not appear to share. The people of Oceania are in the process of stripping down the English language to its bones. Creating Newspeak, which Orwell uses only for examples and ideas which exist only in the novel. The integration of Newspeak into the conversation of the book. One of the new words created is doublethink, the act of believing that two conflicting realities exist. Such as when Winston sees a photograph of a non-person, but must reason that that person does not, nor ever has, existed.The inspiration for Winston's work ,may have come from Russia. Where Stalin's right-hand man, Trotzky was erased from all tangible records after his dissention from the party. And the fear of telescreens harks back to the days when Stasi bugs were hooked to every bedpost, phone line and light bulb in Eastern Europe.His reference to Hitler Youth, the Junior Spies, which trains children to keep an eye out for thought criminals- even if they are their parents; provides evidence for Orwell's continuing presence in pop culture. &quot;Where men can't walk, or freely talk, And sons turn their fathers in.&quot; is a line from U2's 1993 song titled &quot;The Wanderer&quot;.Orwell assumes that we will pick up on these political allusions. But the average grade 11 student will probably only have a vague understanding of these due to lack of knowledge. It is even less likely that they will pick up on the universality of these happenings, like the fact that people still &quot;disappear&quot; without a trace every day in Latin America.Overall, however, the book could not have been better written. Orwell has created characters and events that are scarily realistic. Winston's narration brings the reader inside his head, and sympathetic with the cause of the would-be-rebels. There are no clear answers in the book, and it's often the reader who has to decide what to believe. But despite a slightly unresolved plot, the book serves its purpose. Orwell wrote this book to raise questions; and the sort of questions he raised have no easy answer. This aspect can make the novel somewhat of a disappointment for someone in search of a light read. But anyone prepared to not just read, but think about a novel, will get a lot out of 1984.1984, is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is a gruesome, saddening portrait of humanity, with it's pitfalls garishly highlighted. Its historic importance has never been underestimated; and it's reemergence as a political warning for the 21st century makes it deserving of a second look. Winston's world of paranoia and inconsistent realities is an eloquently worded account of a future we thought we buried in our past; but in truth may be waiting just around the corner."

You just want to forget about the whole thing once you finish reading it. There is something in human in the book, something that turns your stomach, almost like ""devil"" and you want to get away from it. May be Orwell did this on purpose, to make you feel what one feels under that sort of an oppressive government.Some of his predictions in the book are ""eerie"" to say the least. Some people might want to specify this government or other for the subject of the book, but I think at different degrees, one can find dark forces that want to control and oppress others for their interest everywhere and every country even in the West.It is not a long book, which is a plus. You can finish it while the whole story is still in your mind.PS: In War and Peace Tolstoy writes about Pierre's Masonic initiation ceremony. In there Pierre is asked what he is afraid of, the most. Now, ""1984"" gives a possible answer why this question had to be asked in the first place."
78,9562910334,1984,,A3EJT905S6ZS4K,R. Schwartz,4/10,5.0,1104710400,Powerful Existential Warning,"A very meaningful book. I was taken back at how intense it turned out to be; socially, politically, psychologically and existentially. And it really gives one the awful nausea that Sartre spoke of and the angst of Kierkegaard, the existential despair, emptiness, loneliness, the awful outcome that leaves you with a sour pain in the pit in your stomach. But that is only if you remain too attached and subjective. On the other hand, if you can detach yourself from this book and view it objectively, it is the most meaningful and explanatory lesson in awareness to the distinct and very real possibility of a utopian world gone bad. This book is a valid warning.The book is brilliant, portraying an authoritarian government that recreates all thought, erases all history, negating it all into solipsism, that all reality is simply the creation of man - The Party of Ingsoc- and in doing so melts into a radical blind relativism. Ingsoc, the Party of Big Brother which rules, also attempts to create an entirely new form of language - Newspeak - that reduces the variations of meanings to prevent people from independent thinking. In this new language, the word called, ""Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them . . The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.""It's ironic, but ultimately the fundamentalists are blind relativists in that they violently enforce their view and then change to a completely new view - new history, and then re-enforce this view in staunch, one-sided fundamentalism. This is truly blind relativism, which is different from cultural relativism and pragmatism, where there can still be a limited form of relativism that retains values, but not in the world of Big Brother. This is important because there is a huge difference between mindless relativism and the compartmentalization of absolutes in pragmatism, which maintains value retention while tolerating cultural differences. But in Big Brother, all becomes a relativistic void for the Party, which uses hate, fear and torture to achieve its end goal, the goal of power; power for the Inner Party.The government of Orwell's 1984 is different from all the previous authoritarian governments, as it does not fool itself that it trying to help the people. At the end of the current edition is a short essay of Erich Fromm, with an analogy in comparison to two other negative utopian novels with three other positive utopian novels and how society went from such positive idealism to the recognition of negative possibilities in the direction of our future and how our responsibilities and the limited amount of time humanity has as a species to make the necessary changes towards heeding this warning and directing itself towards the positive outcome.Despite the outcome and utter despair the book leaves you with, the valuable lesson speaks for itself. And I think in America, we must recognize our free-market fundamentalist mentality, our military bullying and authoritarian nature that puts the dollar and large corporate control over the proletariat. We need to value Orwell's warning and work towards repairing the great democratic dream of a equalitarian society that puts the rights of the individual ahead of monetary gain and looks towards the preservation of our environment - to restore the ideas of Emerson, Whitman and James and pragmatist values of democratic government actively engaged by the educated working classes.The year 2005 represents a major time for America (Amerika) to wake up from the partisan, unilateral decisions of the Bush Administration's lone ranger policies, which include torture (congress just re-defined this word!) and lies. And in addition to the United States Imperialism, there is another major serious global development resembling Big Brother which has already begun; the WTO (World Trade Organization), well underway with a pseudo-democratic, secretive, powerful, small elite group of plutocrats (mostly United States corporations) enforcing global limits on protective government regulations, reducing environmental protections and proletariat rights, all so under a ""newspeak"" (rhetorical-beneficial) language of ""free-trade."" Orwell has become a superior prophet over Nostradamus.""Is not a matter of whether the war is not real or if it is. Victory is not possible. The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past. And no different past can ever have existed. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects. And its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep the very structure of society in tact."" George Orwell, 1984""In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird."" p. 156WAR IS PEACE - and great profits are gained by large corporate military contractors and the vast oil supply (Halliburton). The economic gain is not for the working class, but for the corporate elites and their private ownerships. Thus the government remains financed and ready for further imperial maneuvers.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY - and we now have tight security measures, wire tapping, censorship and the Patriot Act. All of this enslaves us and removes many of our liberties and private rights, all so for the sake of keeping our freedom secure, slavery to protect freedom. Ultimately, censorship prevents the working class from Socratic inquiry of government policies, thus the government remains in tact. Labor parties, Poplulists-Farmers, Feminists, African Americans/Civil rights, evironmental protections, minimum wage requirements and the working man and woman themselves loose their rights and voices of active participation. They are simply ""prols,"" while the corporate elite, the plutocrats increase their rule, working their way towards totality. Open Democracy and human rights die, aristocracy enslavement lives, all so to protect the freedom of the country.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH - and to remain in ignorance is keep the proletariat quietly content in his mediocre existence, either in poverty or struggle, ceasing the time, strength and desire for Socratic inquiry of government policies. The result; mindless flag waving nationalism. Ignorance masked under the newspeak of ""Free Trade"" and radical privatization without regulatory control leads to monopolistic corporate state owned society. And the flags keep waving. The breakup of a Hollywood couple takes the headlines, while WTO is quiet in the media background. The elite in Control increase and maintain strength. Ignorance is strength."

I had read Animal Farm and thought it was decent so I figured why not try 1984. The book takes place in the future in a time when everyone must obey the law. There are hidden telescreens that are around to view anyone who goes against the law. The book was kind of hard to understand at first because of the language but after the first few chapters I was able to slide right through out. I found it to be very enjoyable because I like the science fiction type genre. Also, it was a different kind of science fiction since it wasn't based on aliens; it was based more on futuristic type inventions and the pros and cons that arose. I would definetly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in sci-fi type books. There really isn't a required reading level but it is probably better for advanced middle school readers and high school readers because of the language and topics covered."

What problem should BB have with thoguht criminals walking to the stake proclaiming their heresy? Also, within years of the story, all Inner Party members would be dead. But the Party would still continue, the old world abolished? No, as was seen with Julia, even those raised from birth by the party still occasioanlly break free from the rule. Also, there is hope int he proles. A thought-criminal might have no more to dot han get some possessions of the Inner Party to the hands of the proles, enough to make them realize they are oppressed.

Although modern terms like ""hatecrime"" and ""hatespeech"" in the book do not come to the surface, I am sure now, that they are implicit product of the heritage left by Orwell.The true value of a book is in the aftertaste, which urges one to think about human instincts and their function. And at the end, it is almost impossible to object to Orwell's argument, that the strongest human instinct is self-preservation and only then comes the drive to procreate.Winston Smith lives in the society founded upon hatred, he believes in the proles, and rightly so. Regardless of the fact, that two, and in some cases, even three generations of the Eastern Europeans experienced a number of Orwell's revelations to become reality (and to become truth!), they managed to change the course of events. In certain circles, though, the collapse of the Soviet Union is still being regarded as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. As long as such a view will exist, Orwell's messages will not loose their urgency.Finally, I remember that those who studied the law in the former Soviet Union were taught that every crime is two-sided, having its subjective and objective side. While fully understanding what is being meant by first, there was some difficulty, though, among the students, in embracing the later. This novel is like a textbook to understand that concept."

(You'll read more about that in the book--it's pretty fascinating.) Thinking unorthodox thoughts about the government and the way things are is a crime, punishable by torture and death.

I enjoyed reading it very much. Orwell's writing is phenomenal. The way he describes things is incredible and beautiful. I admired his bold statement against socialism. His book was extremely persuasive and should be read by all that have not yet read it. It is a classic, yet it holds all the contemporary aspects of a newer book. No part of this novel was unsatisfying for me. There were no parts of the novel that did not keep me waiting for what would happen next. This could quite possibly be my favorite book that I have read yet."

I choose to give this book four stars.The reason that I give this book four stars is because it is an excellent written book that gives a scary future of what the people in the 1950's thought the world was coming to. It follows the main character Winston Smith who is a member of the party of Oceania in a oligarchial world of three superpowers: Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Winston feels as if he is different because he doesn't believe that they are getting the best that they could be getting. He decides to join a secret organization that goes against the government. He learns in a book that is given to him how the government works and why makes the certain choices that it does. The book shows that in the future war will just be used as a way for a power to get rid of surplus goods. The book also states how the government works with the ministries of peace, love, plenty and truth.It also seemed very cool to me some of the ways the government would manipulate the people just so they could maintain control. In the book Winston begins an affair with another party member named Julia and they together plan against their oligarchial society. They rebel at the fact that the government changes history so that it may be able to control there country with ease. With nothing for them to judge there life against they are forced to go by what the government tells them and they each have. They are captured at there secret hideout by the thought police(a group of individuals that monitor for traces of thoughtcrime punishable by death). They are thrown into a jail cell to rot untill they are forced to confess for what they have done. The only reason that I would not give this book five stars is because most of the concepts in the book were very hard to follow.Other books that I would recommend would be Shogun by James Clavell, the Cherub series by Robert Muchamore or Animal Farm by George Orwell. I am a student at HRMS and am in seventh grade."

I understood its freightening warning much better when I read it as an older more mature person.I just saw a show on MSNBC the other night about real &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology that is in use today. Some cities in England are using stratigicly placed surveillance cameras that can actually automatically focus in on suspicious looking characters and run a picture of their face against a database of known criminals. Another example of &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology is electronic toll collection systems that allow the &quot;authorities&quot; to track your whereabouts.Certainly, doublespeak is often used in politics and to shape public opinion today. Bombing innocent civilians and causing widespread destruction is now the meaningless term &quot;collateral damage&quot;. The &quot;Defense Department&quot; is more of an offensive international policing agency that is ready, willing, and able to wreak havoc on any country which is diagreeable to the United States. Nuclear missles are dubiously named &quot;peacekeepers&quot;.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH is America today. How many people in America actually educate themselves about the issues of the day and about the real nature of the politicians running for office? It's pretty obvious to anyone who has bothered to educate themselves that many politicians often don't practice what they preach. People are too quick to just accept sound bites as facts, and don't bother to educate themselves regarding the issues of the day.The only way we can prevent a totalitarian regime like George Orwell described in 1984 from becomming a reality is for every person to be vigilant about protecting their rights and the rights of others, and for people to constantly question things and educate themselves. Unfortantely, I don't have much hope that people will actually prevent George Orwell's nightmare vision from becoming a reality. We're closer than most people realize. 1984 is here!"

As such a big fan, I thought I'd alert other 1984 enthusiasts to a new book that updates Orwell's classic for the PATRIOT Act era. The book is John Twelve Hawks' electrifying, impossible-to-put-down The Traveler. In it, Twelve Hawks introduces us to the Vast Machine, an omnipresent surveillance entity every bit as brutal as Big Brother. With all the political poignancy of 1984--and Hollywood-caliber suspense to boot--The Traveler is a must-read for admirers of Orwell's masterpiece."
88,9562910334,1984,,A3BBVVCUTS8DJ6,Andrea Ray,0/1,5.0,1098057600,1984- book review,"1984 is a story about Winston Smith, a member of the totalitarian communist party of the country Oceania. 1984 was written by George Orwell describing the consequences of a communist government taking hold. Winston Smith works at a government office that publishes propaganda and changes historical records on a daily basis. It operates under the idea that ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past"". This is central to the government and revolves around the realization that history is only made of human memory and records, because it can not be made of matter. In 1984, records are constantly destroyed and rewritten, to the point that no one is actually sure that it is 1984. In order to control human memory, citizens are taught to deny past memories consciously while simultaneously denying that they are denying anything. Winston goes on to rebel and then suffers a fait similar to that of those determined ""counter-revolutionary"" by the Russian socialists. In the end, Winston experience an almost religious change to becoming a devoted follower of the Party.I found 1984 entertaining and challenging, but it not the most exciting or gripping read. Compared to similar books like A Brave New World and Orwell's own Animal Farm, 1984 fell short. The general pessimistic darkness became boring and trite instead of disturbing because there was never a hint of contrast. Oppressive despair as the general mood is fine, but obsessively mulling it over and over is worse than beating the reader over the head with it.I think that 1984 was centered around an idea rather than an emotion, set of characters or plot, and because of this I think that many elements of the story, dominantly the characters, suffered. Instead of the actions being caused by what the characters personalities were, the characters were designed around the actions. The only traits shown were the ones that were necessary to make the actions reasonable. Because of this, even the most important characters were often extremely developed in on area and flat and dull in another. On the other hand, a nice touch was that throughout the story, Winston mentally accepts that he will be caught, but when it actually happens, he is emotionally unprepared. I thought that this made him more realistic and human.As stated before, 1984 prizes an idea above all else, and Orwell seems willing to sacrifice anything and everything to nock it into the reader's head. Newspeak, the language of Oceania, is a good idea to show another aspect of this atrocious government that Orwell wants to illustrate, but did nothing for the plot or the characters. It was supposed to enhance the sense of absolute orthodoxy, but in the end it just seemed bothersome and distracting.While 1984 is a great intellectual triumph, it lacks in everything but mental capacities. It was stilted, stiff and insipid compared to Orwell's other stories."

With the way technology is people can listen to your phone calls and read your E-mails I would like somone to tell me how far we are from a totalitarian society. When I read this book I got chills.

Orwell understood how crucial meaning and communication is to social and political behavior. The Bolsheviks first and then the Nazis both went to great lengths to manipulate meaning, creating an acceptable vocabulary of politically positive words and images and an equally negative vocabulary for that which was to be vilified and destroyed. Attempting to channel behavior into patterns predefined by these limited modes of expression represents the greatest part of the state propogandist's art. Orwell reduced the complexity of this enterprise to something that could be seen for the con game it is. His invention of 'newspeak' demonstrates the reducto ad absurdum of such verbal restrictiveness.In our day, whether Big Brother is really watching or not, we suffer from some of the same contraints of limited language and, in term, limited behavioral options. On the one hand we suffer from a language of polictical correctness that strives to offend no one, but makes speech clumsy and artificial. On the other extreme we suffer from the limited categories that the professional news media use - the narrow meanings available to them for understanding and communicating what is considered 'news'. Since politicians contribute to this limited vocabulary and play off of it, it saves them from facing much real in depth analysis and critique and limits the public to shallow expositions that distort reality and make meaningful political choice impossible.So 1984 has come and gone and we haven't fallen into the dramatic pit that Orwell pictured, but the language we use to deal with social and political issues has been so attenuated that we are in danger of becoming slaves to a limited set of possibilities because we cannot even articulate any alternatives."

And he wrote a dark, unforgettable story in a perfectly crafted style. Ignore the polemic and you still have one of our best novels.Orwell gives us so many brilliant insights. I'll mention my favorite. Orwell saw that totalitarians will always hate beauty and try to drive it out of ordinary life. Why? Because beauty reminds people of what freedom feels like! This theme runs through 1984.Want to see Orwellian in action? Letting a far-left thinker like Erich Fromm write an essay for this book. Fromm manages to turn things upside down so that what Orwell is REALLY writing about is conformity in American corporations. Totalitarian twaddle."

Winston Smith was alive during the glorious revolution, when Big Brother and the Brotherhood commandeered control. From then on, there were three basic rules: war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Big Brother was supreme.

Finally, one of my college classes required it, so I was happy to pick it up, though not without some reserved skepticism beforehand. I knew it was one of those books that is constantly referred to by people who are paranoid about government and distrust everything the government does, which wouldn't really describe me, in general. But, I have to admit that Orwell's writing is masterful. Right from the start, the world he presents is mesmerizing. I think I am safe in saying that in the first third of the book, almost nothing happens. Yet, I can also say that the first third of the book was just as interesting as any of the action that comes later. Every detail, every description, every movement is analyzed in the most fascinating way. Orwell is no idiot. He has that very rare ability of few great authors to show the workings of the inner mind of man in such a true and believable way that you very well believe that he could look at you and know what you are thinking. After the first third of the book, when the story actually progresses, it gets exciting almost in the way that a thriller does. You keep on wondering what move will be next and how the character is going to strategize the demise of the enemy. Then the last third of the book is a devastating, but still masterful analysis of the human mind, free will, and reality. At almost every stage, Orwell presents his ideas with a written clarity that is a language all in its own. In spite of this whole experience and my recognition at how skillful the writing and analysis was, I cannot say that I liked the book, or even if I would recommend it. The main reason for this is that I believe Orwell cheated at the end. The protagonist was putting up a fight against the machine, and in spite of its all-powerful, seemingly omnipotent status, he held off. Now, Orwell had two options. The protagonist either would capitulate under the increasingly intelligent pressure put on by the oppressor, or he would outlast and maintain his own free will to the end. I think that the ending Orwell chose was contrived, and what he did to get the protagonist there was unbelievable. Maybe it's my own principles or feelings, but I suspect that if Orwell had done it well enough, I would have at least respected his approach. But as it is now, I had to shake my head and say to myself: No. That's not true to human nature. I don't buy that. And what's worse, I felt that Orwell must have known that himself. His writing was too brilliant before, too logical, too well-reasoned. The person who wrote all of that can't possibly believe in this moment either. So, I suspect, that in order to get the ending that he wanted, he contrived the tipping point and then returned to his brilliant form to bring the story to its conclusion. One misstep is a harsh way to judge a truly exemplar book, but I believe that it was a key moment and it unravels all the true elements Orwell had so carefully set up before. Overall, however, it would be difficult to say to not read the book, because this type of writing and insight is difficult to come by. So if you are looking for a meaty intellectual treat, read it. But don't let him cheat you in the end."

Rather it is a world where the dark sides of the human nature has been given the chance to rule. The book holds numerous references to the horrors of stalinism and nazism as well as describing the problems with democracy (the same argument that he brilliantly describes in his previous novels and essays). Also it shows the problem of the individual within the collektive and how easily groups and structures can hold the individul hostage.

George Orwell described a world where people are constantly under surveillance by its totalitarian government. By employing two-way televisions and police in civilian clothes, the government monitors people's behavior, deed, and most frighteningly - their minds. No individualism is permitted, and anyone who remotely opposes the government will somehow be caught and completely distroyed.The idea of the book is as far-fetched as it is realistic. That's what's so haunting about the book. The described totalitarian practices may seem absolutely impossible, while when compared to the world we live in, we see more eerie resemblences than not. Moreover, the writing itself was splendid. The descriptions were so vivid that you literally feel yourself a persecuted citizen of the world described.On the negative end, perhaps in an effort to accentuate the point of atrocity of the negative utopia described, the author employed too much descriptions and time on the actual persecution process. The descriptions were grotesque at some points that you really have to have the stomach for it. My advice is, read it, but read it in small dosages. I read the second half of the book in one day, and was gravely depressed for three hours after I finished."

The obvious questions it raises about society, government, control, power, unity, trust, and faith in the human character might leave you thinking critically about humanity's direction (if you haven't before). Ultimately I felt like the book's strongest point was it's exploration of what &quot;reality&quot; becomes when manipulated by the mind's interpretation of it. But I think people's reactions to 1984 will vary according to their own insight into the books topics, especially within the political realm. Without a doubt, a great book."

It should serve as a warning, nothing more.Instead, I'll say that I read it as required reading in a high-school literature class and found Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to be a less heavy-handed approach to storytelling.

The book is a prediction and shadow of our world today. Ever since Orwell published his book, it has been like a bible to people everywhere. This book is fascinating not because of the feeling put into it, but because of how it shows and gives the reader a sense of how humanity is and can become like the world in Orwell's book.The only freedom shown in the world of 1984 is the self-thought of what the word actually means. Winston Smith is the man who experiences this and leads us through this horrible world. He doubts the righteousness of the totalitarian government (Big Brother) that rules Oceania, (one of three superstates in the world of 1984). The book starts with Winston and then shows how Big Brother (the government) is unreal. The government made its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. As Winston's rebellion develops, we see how Big Brother is not as unreal as we think, he seems real, and to all the citizens he is real, this is what helps control Oceania the belief of Big Brother.Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia are the three battling superstates. All want control, have the same kind of government, and are at constant war to obtain what they want. The process used to get absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, like Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. Big Brother manipulates its citizens psychologically into suitable ways of thinking. Instead of only using propaganda techniques, Big Brother also uses something called Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and it is used to control the citizens' unorthodox thinking. Winston works at the base of Newspeak; he changes words, news, stories, and information for the government. The telescreens monitor each citizen and stop them of their privacy, revolt, or un-orderly behavior.Winston meets a girl named Julia who also feels the same as Winston does about Big Brother. They become lovers and their relationship leads them to what gives the reader the true sense of what the book is truly about. The backbone of Big Brother (the government) is revealed. When Orwell shows what really is Big Brother, gives the reader the true sense of the masterpiece of George Orwell's book.The manipulative technique used by Big Brother to control their citizens is unrecognizable; it is all about mind control. The secret for Big Brother's success is doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Big Brother is supposedly a person, the head leader of the government in the book 1984, but he doesn't exist. The government controls people by creating a false leader with a system of mind control.The book shows us how a government can become powerful and how it is possible in our world today. The thought of the possibility actually happening is frightening because our world now can become the world of greed for control, violence, mystery, and slavery that is shown in the book 1984. That is what makes this book so good; it truly pulls us into the reading because the reality in the book and our life, is paralleled by the possibility that can exist."

While I'm only 14, anyone who is 13 or above should be able to grasp the main concepts of this book. You are very compassionate when you realize the vain struggle of Winston and Julia.

Nor is the world portrayed by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four a place or even merely a set of political or social circumstances. Rather, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a state of mind, a way of being, an atmosphere in which the dark side of our nature lives and turns all around it darker still. It is a time or place which we create when we turn away from the light that is within us, within each individual self, to the empty darkness of group will and psychology; of ""massmindedness"". Thus do we create for ourselves to live in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four.Orwell's ""fiction"" of a world in which, but for a lingering echo, individuality had all but passed into extinction, could have been set in any time or place where ""massmindedness"" is paramount and where the individual exists merely to serve the group. Throughout history, most religions have preached, most governments have practiced and most societies have been organized around such ""massmindedness"". It is only the calendar which might confuse and comfort us, which might convince us that Nineteen Eighty-Four was merely a gruesome story about a time and place that never was nor could ever be. But nothing is further from the truth. And the simple truth is that Nineteen Eighty-Four is NOW.In Nineteen Eighty-Four, there are no heroes, except as an idea, an ideal may be said to be a hero. All of its characters are exceedingly human, and this is what makes Nineteen Eighty-Four both timely and timeless, both powerful and profoundly pathetic. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often upsetting, sometimes disheartening, but, when its main lesson is learned, never depressing. It is fundamentally a story of hope, of a truth which can be discovered (although too late for all concerned); a truth which can be seen by us and taken as not only our ideal, but as the practical guide by which, to a greater or lesser extent, we can avoid the very pitfalls which consumed Winston and Julia and O'Brien and Big Brother, and liberate ourselves from the tyrany and ultimate destructiveness of the group and its massminded stranglehold on our minds, our hearts and our souls.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a simple story of faith wrongly placed. Winston Smith, its main character, searches to escape the suffocating and oppressive world manipulated by and for a ruling group, The Party. He believes that he is seeking a political, a social solution with which he can combat, can destroy the evil of group-think and the ""massmindedness"" in which he lives. Instead, he finds the most exquisitely human, individual ""weapon"" with which to pursue his salvation: love. But, as we humans are too often prone to do, Winston overlooks what is simple and obvious, what is at hand, and, even as do those he disdains, he puts his faith in another group, The Brotherhood. (It is not for Winston to realize that his answer lies in the idea and practice of ""brotherhood"", rather than in the imaginary purity of ""The Brotherhood"".) In the end, Winston is betrayed not by his enemies, but, in a real sense, by himself, by his failure to see the worth in the object of his own worship; the individual and the emotional life with which he or she can find their own peace and presence, even in a world gone apparently mad.Winston, with his male oriented solution, seeks one group to combat another group, while Julia, a woman, brings the possibility of true salvation to him (and them) in the idea and practice of individual love. Julia knows the truth, and what is worthwhile, but Winston (the very name of the great male war leader of Orwell's recent past) plunges on ahead, seeking a ""political"", ""social"" solution (not unlike the many male ""leaders"" of all time past). This may be a small (or maybe the greatest) point of the book.It is an instructive book; there is a good deal of What Every Young Person Ought to Know - not in 1984, but 1949. Mr Orwell's analysis of the lust for power is one of the less satisfactory contributions to our enlightenment, and he also leaves us in doubt as to how much he means by poor Smith's ""faith"" in the people (or ""proles""). Smith is rather let down by the 1984 Common Man, and yet there is some insinuation that common humanity remains to be extinguished."

Minerd ""The Coding Catholic""",1/3,4.0,1204329600,"A Classic Dystopia Against Hard, Fascistic Communism","Often cited by many as a central text in the fashion of twentieth-century dystopias, 1984 remains a classic in spite of its inextricable connection to Soviet-style communism. While the work does not have the sociological poignancy of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, 1984 does remain a telling oracle of the psychological tendencies which could destroy the human soul even in the post-Soviet world. While the text only cursorily treats the rise of the zeitgeist, one can easily glean several dangers which are oracularly pronounced by the narrative.First of all (and most obviously), there is the danger of a lack of human questioning which, given enough coaxing and time, can render man nearly impervious to the spirit of questioning which is necessary to prevent the enslavement of man. While this condition is basically taken a priori by Orwell as a setting for his work, this is the closest point of contact between 1984 Bradbury's aforementioned work. Additionally, the psychological ramifications of breaking free from such thralldom take two distinct paths, that of hope for change (even if that becomes somewhat mitigated into the hope for change in an indistinct future) and one of self-indulgence in the midst of an unchangeable zeitgeist. These, coupled with the final realization of hope which is found (albeit meekly) in the lower, ignored (and therefore free) class, are the true content of 1984.While the text is markedly tied to the state of affairs found in a state of established Soviet-style communism, it also narrates the psychological situations (and outer-methods of psychological suppression and control) which still remain poignant to a Western society which is on the brink of destroying its own notion of liberty. For this reason, I can easily overcome the misgivings which I have for the text's nearly direct connection to already-dead Soviet Union. The message does indeed exist beyond that historical fact and therefore comes with my personal recommendation."

If you look at our society today, although no where as severe as Orwell's vision, the shear human stupidity that abounds and the oppressive governments still present in certain parts of the world leads one to believe that his vision if we are not careful could become a reality in the near future. It seems that as time goes by and with all the technological advancement we've made, individuality and uniqueness are in danger of becoming extinct. It's enough to listen to today's music, to see what we now call ""entertainment"" for the masses to know that George Orwell ( at least when it comes to human beings) was right on the money.It certainly wasn't a pleasure read and while I do admit that it is a relevant book and it is one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read, I can't say that it is one of the best books I've read in my life. It was deeply disturbing and depressing and I was thoroughly disappointed with the end. I consider myself a realist but I was really hoping that Winston's idea of the defeat of Big Brother would become a reality, but in the end the Party is the one that wins. Did Orwell write this book with the intention of scaring us? No, he wrote it as a warning of how seriously screwed up the world can become if we stop thinking for ourselves.

His society is the most extreme one imaginable created by a government with absolute power. While painting his picture of a dystopian world, Orwell links us into Winston Smith, the main character, an everyman who the reader is able to identify with. He is someone like us - an outsider in this totalitarian world, who is unable to completely submit his mind and will to Big Brother (the State). We are able to experience the absolute control of the government through Winston's eyes - its physical and psychological control of its subjects, to Winston's expanding discontent, his rebellious acts and finally their destined consequences.Under this veil, Orwell demonstrates how weak and frail a totalitarian regime truly is. In order to control its subjects, Big Brother has to have absolute control of information - to even alter the past, to constantly control minds through propaganda, to create constant war to keep the society poor, and to use fear mongering (i.e. encouraging kids to rat out their parents to the thought police) to force its will on the people. It even uses language as mind control - whittling language away to limit thoughts and expressions. Ultimately, Big Brother is only able to force Winston to submit by torturing and brainwashing him into an empty shell like the rest of its subjects.This book is great for the high school reader and beyond - it is an easy read while allowing the reader to consider the implications of living in such a society. Its endurance is also impressive - this book was originally published in 1949 - the same work could be published today and be just as relevant."

George Orwell does a great job of telling the story of Winston Smith's life and how he goes through life rebelling against the government. He describes every setting with emence detail and it felt like I was right there with Winston going through his every day struggles to survive and remain in his eyes sane. The way Orwell conveyed the story through the diary as well as just writing it really worked well. The diary tells about Winston`s character and how he reacts to life around him. I believe that when writing this story George Orwell wrote a book that is a great success.As a high school student I enjoyed 1984. It challenged me to think outside of the box and more critically. To say that War is Peace and Freedom is Slavery and actually believe it causes one to question the meaning of certain things. In our world war is not peace and slavery is the opposite of freedom, so what could have led people to believe and just accept that these things are true. That is what 1984 truly explains, that humans can become brain washed into believing almost anything. The scary part about this is that it actually can happen as shown in the book through a series of torture and reeducating Winston was reformed into one who believed in what the Republic of Oceania believed. With propaganda, the party ruling over the people in 1984 can shape the minds of jst about anyone.In conclusion, 1984 is a well written, suspenseful story of a man who becomes the same as everone else. There is no room for individuality in the setting created by George Orwell. Everyone believes the same or are arrested and reformed!"

The truly scary thing is not that there are noticeable similarities between our political culture and the culture portrayed in this book, but rather the even closer similarities between that culture and our corporate culture.After all, in the corporate world, as in the ""Oceana"" of this book, the ""proles"" (common laborers) can pretty much think and say what they want, although it IS possible for individuals to go too far. But if one wants a comfortable life in an office job, one not only has to watch what one says, but how one says it, and what one can be demonstrated to think. If one is caught in the ""thoughtcrime"" of being insufficiently enthusiastic about one's company, or showing doubts about whether what it's doing is right or not, one will surely be ""disappeared""; one's co-workers will show up one day and simply not find you there, and if anyone is foolish enough to ask what happened, they will simply be told, in a tone of voice that brooks no further questions, ""s/he is no longer with the department"". If the offense was serious enough, that person will never work in as high-level a position again, anywhere. They won't have been taken off and tortured; they will simply have been exiled to the status of common laborer, where they're no longer dangerous.Also, if you doubt the existence of ""doublethink"", consider that corporations want honest, trustworthy employees, but heaven help the employee who speaks his/her mind (even quietly, on his/her own time) if it disagrees with corporate policy.The real world may be more subtle than the novel, but truth is no less truth for being subtle."

I admit that this book did have a good message and was thoroughly enforced from the beginning to end. However, thats all that happened.It was just thoughts of a sad man with perverse and suspicouis thoughts. The main character constantly dwelled on how horrible everything was and eventually how he was going to fight against it. But never did, unless you count having an affair and writing in a journal or buying an old paperweight.At times the story would pick up, and just as quickly as it picked up it drastically fell back into the continuous complaints of Winston.1984 is well written.

It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die. This prison kills, yet it is justified. 1984 is maybe that word, filicide being the closest English equivalent."

The whole story is about a man named Winston Smith, who starts to have questions in his mind about the totalitarian government that he has always known and lived with. As is typical of Orwell novels, 1984 is about one man who is all alone in the world, who tries to break away from conformity.The world that Orwell has created in this novel, called Oceania, is so very different from our own, that it is almost impossible to imagine. The Party is in power, and they can ""vaporize"" anyone who they even suspect of ""thoughtcrime"" (thinking things contrary to the Party's beliefs). The main figure of the government of Oceania is Big Brother. The term ""Big Brother is watching you"" comes from posters that the Party put up all over in the book.This novel makes you realize just how precious the freedoms we have are. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in politcal fiction. But a word of caution, this book is not very cheerful or uplifting, so this is not a book to read if your not in the mood for something depressing."

Orwell writes like Monet paints, in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful, mysterious, and beautiful.Throughout 1984, the reader follows Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One. The world is subdivided into three major super powers. Winston lives in Oceana, which is run by Big Brother. Three ministries govern Oceana: The Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Peace. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, and it is there he meets Julia.Much like Orwell's description of the scenes themselves, he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet. Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail; though, in his descriptions of Winston's relationships to the world he lives in, Julia, and Big Brother, he writes with enough description that Orwell's vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page.The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word, ""God"" from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit. No matter a person's spiritual background, the critical person should find it uncanny that in 1949 Orwell imagined a world in which the name `God' would become illegal.Though, we do not live in a world in which three empirical superpowers govern us, the critical person should wonder if we are closer to Orwell's 1984 than we realize. Or, perhaps, ideologically, we are there and realize it; though, we have become so accustomed to living in Orwell's 1984 that we willingly give up our rights and personal identity in the name of government sanctioned security and equality."

Orwell's insight into politics and human nature is brilliantly expressed throughout the novel, which vividly depicts a society in which people's lives are monitored and controlled to an unprecedented degree. Many parallels can be drawn between this ""futuristic"" government structure and several present-day political regimes. Orwell's ideas are clearly articulated and well expressed, while the story itself thoroughly engages the reader. Many of the concepts introduced in this novel have become embedded into the collective conscience of western nations. This novel should be taught in Canadian classrooms"

Winston works as a functionary of the Ministry of Truth where history is rewritten to favor the Party&#8217;s line summed up beautifully by the Party&#8217;s slogan &#34;Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&#34; A little at a time Winston begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed. This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Socialism to Communism to Totalitarianism.With today&#8217;s technology, Big Brother is a real threat and with the Government growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future &#8211; if we are not careful."

Despite his desires to fit in, Winston is at risk merely because he can remember what life was like before 'Big Brother'.

Through out the centuries, men have preached equality and hipocrosy. They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached non-thought and conformity. They were Big Brother. Through out history, a long line of men have stood, begining with Plato, continuing with Stalin, and propagated today by every man, woman, and child who believes that 2+2=5, that A is not A.These men have stood for Big Brother, have stood for Ingsoc, have stood for evil, and have stood for 1984. George Orwell's masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals: for love, for happiness, for individualism, for ego. On the surface, Orwell paints a picture more sickening, and more chilling to any person who believes that they are, that they are not a group, not a consortium, but exist in and for their own right.This is not a Utopia; this is what could happen, not what has happened. It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out, will not conform. It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light, for those who think, and those who know that 1984 can be stopped, by those who have stopped it through out the centuries: those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue. The hero of this book is not Winston; it is the old prole' hanging out laundry, and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty. In the end, the proletariat must rise; for they are not the lowest class, but the highest. The party members consider themselves higher because they have force, and therefor, by their reckoning, power. But they do not; they have nothing; everything is the Party's. But they are not the party; Big Brother is the Party. In the end, the Prole's are the powerful ones, for they know the beauty of reality, and of the of the simple phrase, &quot;It is mine."

Having read it I can see how it has become regarded as classic fiction. Of course the year 1984 has come and gone and many folks say had it been titled ""2009"" it would have been much more accurate. I chose this book because my son had to read it for school (I was never assigned this one myself) but I always felt I ""should"" read it. So I have now.For those of you who haven't read it, it is a complex novel but with a fairly basic plot. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a functioning member of a society in the future who meets a woman he is attracted to. Much of the book surrounds their attempt to form a relationship in this society that just won't allow that sort of thing. Of course the real point and value of the novel is to illustrate where our current society may be headed if we don't change course, a sort of anti-utopian (dystopian?) novel. This book has brought us common terms such as ""Big Brother"", ""doublethink"", and ""thought police."" There are long sections where Winston reads to his girl friend from the official government manual detailing how the society came to be as well as the evolution of the government-speak (""Newspeak"")language. I am glad that I've read this novel but at the same time I can't say that I would ever want to read it again. My political/societal views are already pretty much cemented in place and this book, while thought provoking, did not change my views. I do agree that it should be studied at the High School level though, not only for its value to the world of literature but also as a way to kick start young people's thinking on what a society should and shouldn't be."

In response to the person who claims that this is a book about ""socialism"": socialism is collective ownership of the means of production by the working class. We obviously do not have this in the US. The oligarchs own the means of production and the government and the tax payers subsidize them and their corporate fist known as the pentagon.

The oligarchs then removed the communists from the Duma (Nazi DICTATORSHIP style or USA style).

To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you.

It is a classic of the dystopian (or ""Negative Utopia"") genre. Though it was written in 1949, and the real year 1984 has already passed, the totalitarian society of the future George Orwell describes is remarkably believable and seems more possible than ever.The world of ""1984"" is much different than our present world; the territories are now divided into Oceania (which includes Great Britain and the Americas), Eurasia (includes the Soviet Union), and Eastasia (includes China, Japan, and Korea). These three powers are engaged in perpetual war, in which alliances are constantly formed and split. The governments of each of the three ""superstates"" has an enormous amount of control over the citizens and media. ""Big Brother"", ruler of Oceania, is seen as an omnipotent, infallible leader. The departments of Oceanian government are the Ministry of Peace (concerned with war), the Ministry of Plenty (concerned with rations of food and other goods), the Ministry of Love (concerned with the arrest and torture of those opposing the government), and the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Truth is perhaps the most influential of the four, as it is concerned with spreading propaganda of the Party (the only political group allowed in Oceania). The government places ""telescreens"" in most of the citizens' homes and various public places, which are generally unable to be turned off. These telescreens continuously provide information about government affairs. They can also be used as monitors for the government to observe what citizens are doing inside of their homes at any given time.The book centers around the protagonist, Winston Smith, a citizen of London, in Oceania. He is employed in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, where he alters recent and historical articles and documents to coincide with what the Party desires to be represented as absolute fact. He finds his work challenging and interesting, but starts to increasingly wonder about the real facts that are hidden in the past and deeply questions ""Ingsoc"" (the form of English Socialism in Oceania's government). Winston begins keeping a journal of his thoughts about life and government, sitting at a place in his house away from his telescreen so he can't be watched. This is just one small part of a chain of events that leads him to become increasingly evasive and defiant of the Party, trying to keep out of the government's watch.Winston becomes romantically involved with a girl named Julia, who also detests the government's restrictions and lies. Winston and Julia try to sneak away to places free from government surveillance as often as they can, so they can be together. Winston hears rumors of a ""Brotherhood"", a group secretly working to disobey, and perhaps eventually overthrow, the Party. He constantly searches for evidence that such a group really does exist and that there may be hope for a revolution after all.Orwell takes important details into consideration to make this society seem real, particularly ""Newspeak"". Newspeak is regarded as Oceania's official language, and is ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". The goal of Newspeak's usage is to narrow the range of thought and individuality. Synonyms and antonyms are constantly being obliterated and many meanings can be summed up with greater rapidity than in ""Oldspeak"" (standard English) through abbreviations. Though Oldspeak is still used throughout the course of the novel, Newspeak phrases often appear in government publications and occasionally in dialogue. One of the common expressions, ""doublethink"", occurs when citizens accept the government's new and false facts as truth, in the place of previously established and real facts. The fear and oppression within such a society, where words are twisted in the government's favor and freedom of expression is destroyed, is conveyed with incredible believability in Orwell's work."

The cunning realism that is embedded upon every page is something truly worth reading. Personally as a writer I feel that after reading this novel I have grown and improved my own writing technique. Not to mention the actually genius involved in contemplating the elaborate world of restricted freedom and no piece of mind. George Orwell completely shatters all walls of possibilities when he introduces many variations of mass control as well as mass acceptance of lies. The complexity of the main character Winston Smith in itself is simply astonishing. So tragic and heart felt is his predicament that sympathy is quickly given to the fictional character. This is mostly because of the fact that certain freedoms that we have are taken for granted. While in &quot;1984&quot; the lack of freedom is equally accepted and taken for granted by the people of the novel. Which reminds us to think and judge for our selves what it is right. This is the utmost reason for me appreciating and taking to heart this novel.&gt;&gt;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak my mind...&lt;&lt;

The book itself, is a fantastic story of a man (Winston) who is beaten down by the society he lives in. Unable to accept the Party, he commits a Thought Crime. He gets away with it for a while, but then he meets up with a girl and this leads to his down fall. Now lets not take the story at face value. The book was written in 1949 (??) just after world war 2. Orwell didn't actually expect his future society to happen by 1984, it probably seems like a nice far enough in the future time. We could rename it 2184 and it will have the same effect on its readers and be just as relevant.Big Brother in the book does not relate to some silly 1990's (2000's) fad TV show. BB is a political party. Now look around at our society. We have CC TV Cameras, a person can't use a phone of an ATM without the government knowing. You can't catch a train without cameras watching you. Neighbour sying on you looking for terrorist activities. (Like the Macarthy era, and now today)This book is a warning to us from the past about allowing government into our private lives. Will we be a free peole, of a society of slaves to a goverment party? This is what Orwell and Huxley (Brave New World) are trying to tell us."

The book spoke bluntely to me, further solidifying in my mind what is happening in our present time and the path we are paving towards the future.Written in 1949 a few decades before the advent of the personal computer and worldwide networks. Orwell lacked the means of explaining the technology by which ""big brother"" was able to keep a watchful eye via the tv. He touched briefly on the two way communication capability. If you relate that to present day. The computer is what he would have meant if the book was written a bit later. If you havent noticed, computers, high speed internet, multimedia accessories, etc are all being thursted apon us. We reach out for it willingly as means of entertainment.

The main character in the novel, Winston Smith, is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in the country of Oceania. Winston and his fellow citizens are monitored everywhere they go, even in their own homes. Party members spy on everyone using ever-present telescreens, and pictures of ""Big Brother,"" the Party's leader, are on display everywhere. The Party's main goal is to eliminate all forms of individual thought, which can lead to rebellion. In order to do that, the language of Newspeak is being integrated into society in hopes of eliminating 80% of all words and thus reducing the chances of a revolt. Sex is also another aspect of life considered taboo by the Party, and Winston eventually begins an affair with a woman named Julia with full knowledge of the fact that if they get caught, they could both be killed by the government. Winston ultimately finds himself fighting a dangerous battle with the Party, and it's a fight he cannot possibly hope to win.This novel is as powerful now as it was when it was written in the late 1940s. Orwell's commentary about the dangers of totalitarianism coupled with an analysis of the powers of psychological manipulation are truly frightening. I can't say that this book is enjoyable to read because the subject matter is very disturbing, but ""1984"" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking book that should be ready by everyone."

Allen,1/2,4.0,1193616000,Big Brother Is Out to Get You,"This classic story of Orwell's imagined future in 1984 written during the 1950s is a stark warning against totalitarian systems of government. In the story the government is headed by a shadowy figure titled Big Brother. This popular reference to ""the man"" or other monitoring organization originates in this story. The basic concept is that the ruling party monitors all aspects of a person's life through telescreens, microphones, and an elaborate spy system, among others. They create their own history and destroy all accounts which differ from their account of history.They also invent a language called Newspeak which could be a reference to using politically correct language. Newspeak is structured to comply solely with the political philosophies of the Party and is intended to make thought which occurs contrary to this philosophy impossible. If someone tries to make claims to the contrary or engage in discussions that oppose the party it is considered ""crimethink"" and the person is taken away to be ""fixed.""If current events or philosophies change, a complex system of forgery and reworking is in place to rewrite history so that Big Brother always makes accurate predictions, the economy is always better than it was in the past and things appear to be great on paper. In reality, people barely subsist, disease and crime is common, and life in general is much worse compared to life prior to the Revolution which occurred in the 1950s-60s in conjunction with wide spreadnuclear war. Old copies of books and newspapers are burned to eliminate any hardcopy of actual history.There is no reality but that which the Party and Big Brother espouse. If you think outside or remember something different from the stated reality, you are considered delusional and in a minority of one. Those who persist in the belief that Big Brother is wrong, are arrested and systematically tortured and brainwashed to the point where they begin accepting the Big Brother philosophy and reality as truth.The main character works for the Party but has doubts as to the positive benefits of the Party and its philosophy. He feels repressed and seeks out ways to fight against this overwhelming power. The first part of the book walks through his growing realization of the continuous brainwashing and creation of reality which can change at the drop of a hat.The 2nd part adds very little to the overall plot and really could be skipped without much loss in value. It additionally contains a gratuitous amount of promiscuous behavior which serves little purpose other than an appeal to the prurient interest.The last part of the book describes in detail the arrest, torture, and brainwashing of the protagonist. He has many logical arguments and perspectives which would likely occur to the reader fighting against the philosophy of Big Brother. This helps to make believable his eventual conversion to belief that Big Brother is good and right regardless of the reader's perspective grounded in the reality of today's thought.1984 is quite thought provoking and serves as a good reminder that any political party or dictator with absolute power is dangerous and measures should be taken to avoid movement towards this type of system."

You are under the command of a leader called ""Big Brother"". Constantly on government surveillance, you try to escape Big Brother's listening and viewing devices, but, of course, you can't. Nobody can really escape.In the year 1984, bombs invade the city of London. On the Malabar Front a war starts, in another state of the world, called Eastasia. The Ministry of Truth, a government organization, broadcasts to the population via a network of telescreens. These devices, which intrude on all aspects of people's lives, are also capable of monitoring their every word and action. They form part of an immense surveillance system used by the Ministry of Love -another government organization- and its dreaded agents called Thought Police, to serve their singular goal: the elimination of ""thought crime"". Winston Smith is a Party worker; Part of the social party known as the Outer Party, the pity of the intrusive government. Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth - the government organization in charge of modifying historical news for consistency. When Winston finds proof that the Party is lying, he starts off on a journey of self-questioning. In doing so, he becomes a thought-criminal. Winston begins to notice that a young Party member, Julia, is watching him. She wears the special sash of the ultra-zealous Anti Sex League and Winston fears that she is an informant. However, to his surprise, she reveals herself as a subversive, and they begin a dangerous relationship. This inspires Winston to explore deeper the difference between propaganda and reality. Ultimately, it leads him to O'Brien - a member of the Inner Party who sets Winston on the beginning of an amazing discovery.The book 1984 is a perfect read for anyone that is willing to see the world in a whole new aspect. Not written to a specific group of people, this book can be perceived from any point of view, and from any part of a modern-day- society. One reason people should read this book is because it sees the government from a whole new perspective. The book, 1984 was published in 1949. It predicts the way that a slightly communist government, would function in the future. What I find completely surprising, is that many of the futuristic devices in the book 1948 have become true to this day. When you put a good amount of thought into it, it all becomes reality. Today the government watches our every move through computer, phone, and ever video surveillance. It's scary to think that even now, as you read this, someone could be watching you. Also, the government still hides secrets through propaganda press. Another reason why this book should be read, is because it has a large array of quotes, such as: ""War is peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength"" (Orwell, 1949, p.27). It provides the reader with a complete set of wisdom and knowledge through its quotation and lessons. The last reason that I will share, why someone should read this book, is because it keeps your interest. Even though the book isn't exactly a fast read, it's completely addicting the entire way through. Keeping your hands off of it is an almost impossible task to accomplish. It contains the ability to keep the attention of a monkey, and yet can relate to someone with the intelligence of Einstein.In conclusion everyone, and I mean everyone, should read this book. With its perspective of government conspiracy, relation to modern day life, knowledgeable quotes, ability to contain attention, and its intelligent relation; I am positive it will keep you, and anyone else, on the edge of their seat.-Jonathan Lightcap"

I just re-read the book and it still packs the wallop now as it did then. Perhaps even more so since one can see parts of this book coming true.This was required reading back in the day, and I am glad it was. A series of ""Negative Utopias"" such as Animal Farm, Farenheit 451, Brave New World warned of the dangers of societies where personal freedoms are lost, the individual and free spirit are crushed.These warnings and themes are ingrained in our speech today, which is a good thing. 1984 speaks of a world always at war, citizens are under constant surveillence, history is changed on a daily basis. It is a sharp criticism of Communism, Fascism or any government that restricts personal freedoms.It can be a depressing read, since the environment is dark, oppressive, gloomy and the sad ending is foreshadowed by the characters. But it has to be dark, because a society so stripped from freedom would be impoverished.

First, it's on the ALA's list of top banned or challenged books, and second because it's really, really good.As with all the books I read, there's always a little part of me thinking about what I'm going to say about the book once I finally decide to write about it. Sometimes I start composing in my mind, coming up with the pithy words and phrases that have made me into the international book reviewing superstar that I am.This time, however, I could barely concentrate for the cacophony in my head. There's just so much going on in this novel that doing it any sort of justice would probably require writing a book that was longer than the book that it was analyzing. And as much as I love you guys, I'm not about to write a whole book about this. Probably because I reckon better minds than mine already have.Regardless, it's hard to choose where exactly to go on this one. There are so many political, sociological, psychological and philosophical threads to pick up here that no matter what I write about, I'm pretty sure I'll get responses about how I didn't mention the solipistic nature of Ingsoc and its relationship to the philosophy behind modern cable news network reporting strategies. Don't worry, guys - I got that one.I suppose two big things came to mind while I was reading it this time, and the first of them was inspired by the previous book I read, To Kill a Mockingbird. In that book, Atticus Finch talks a lot about bravery. To teach his son about what it truly means to be brave, he gets him to take part in an old woman's struggle to free herself of a morphine addiction before she dies - an excruciating process that is more likely to fail than to succeed. But she does it anyway. Atticus says to his son about bravery, ""It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.""The question in my mind, then, was ""Is Winston Smith brave?""It's a hard question to answer, really. By Atticus' definition, you could say that he is. A member of the Outer Party that rules the superstate of Oceania, Winston Smith is a part of a greater machine. He works in the records department of the Ministry of Truth, diligently altering and ""rectifying"" the data of the past to bring it into alignment with what the Party wants to be true. His is a world where there is no such thing as objective truth - the truth is what the Party says it is.A good member of the Party sublimates his will to that of the Party. What Big Brother wants, she wants. She has no love but love for the Party and no dreams but to do what the Party wants of her. A good Party member doesn't have plans or hopes or dreams. He doesn't ask questions or idly wonder if things could be different from what they are. A good Party member doesn't think. He is born, lives, consumes, and dies.Winston, however, cannot be a good Party member. He wonders why the world is the way it is, and begins down a road to assert his own identity as a human being. He knows full well that he will fail, that in the end he and the woman he loves will be delivered into the hands of the Thought Police, and he is appropriately terrified. But he goes through with it anyway. He keeps a diary of his thoughts and actively tries to join an underground movement that is determined to overthrow the Party and Big Brother. He declares himself willing to undertake acts of heinous treason, all in the name of resistance against the Party.And in the end, he fails, just as he knew he would. So does this make Winston, a man who is so far in character from Atticus Finch, a brave person? Well, yes and no.He does meet Atticus' definition of bravery - persisting in what you believe to be right, even in the knowledge that you will probably fail. Winston puts his own life on the line multiple times, committing Thoughtcrime of the highest order. But is he doing it for some higher ideal, or is he doing it for more selfish reasons? Flashbacks to his younger days suggest that Winston Smith was an unrepentantly selfish child, who was willing to disregard the dire straits of his own mother and baby sister in order to get what he wanted. Could we not say that the adult Winston does the same? That he is more interested in freedom for himself than for others? Is his rebellion against Big Brother political or personal? He claims that he wants to see the world changed and freedom brought to all people, but how far can we trust a mind that's been well-trained in Doublethink?This, of course, gets right back to the Big Question of why people do the right thing, when it might be so much easier and profitable to do otherwise. Atticus Finch could have let Tom Robinson swing, thus saving himself and his family a whole lot of trouble, just as Winston could have just given up and emulated his neighbor, Parsons, becoming as good a Party member as possible. Neither man could do that, though, because is was not in their nature to do so. It was impossible for Winston to continue to live the way the Party wanted to and, given time, he may have been able to reach beyond meeting his own personal needs and seen to the needs of his greater community.Unfortunately, we never get the chance to find out, as the Thought Police eventually get tired of watching him and take him in. To his credit, he does hold out to the last extreme before he betrays Julia in his heart, so perhaps he is brave after all.The other thing that came to mind while I read was the modern use of the word ""Orwellian,"" and how it falls vastly short of what is depicted in this book. It gets thrown about any time a city puts up a few CCTV cameras downtown, or a business decides to put surveillance cameras in their store. It comes up when we put RFID chips in passports and credit cards, or when we think about how much data Google can hold about us. The word brings to mind a sense of constant surveillance, never being able to move or act without some government or corporation knowing what we're doing.While the concept of the two-way telescreens in this book certainly are a logical extension of surveillance culture, to call a customer database or red light cameras ""Orwellian"" is like calling a Bronze-age chariot a Ferrari. It betrays an incredible lack of understanding of what exactly is going on in the world that Orwell has built. We may be watched by these people, but in comparison to the average citizen of Oceanea - prole or Party member - we are still remarkably free.There are still freedoms available to us that people like Winston never had, and couldn't understand even if they were offered. We can protest, we can voice our disagreements, we can channel our energies into whatever pursuit we choose, or not channel them at all. We have the freedom to decide who we want to be and how we want to live, at least within the limits of a well-ordered society. We do not live in daily terror that we might be abducted from our beds, our lives ended and our very existence erased from record and memory. Honestly, I think a few security cameras pale in comparison to the horror that is Oceanea and the world of Big Brother.There is so much more to talk about with this book. I find Newspeak fascinating, and its foundations both amazing and terrifying. The idea that a concept can only truly exist if there's a word for it brings to mind those ""untranslatable"" words you find in every language. For example, there's no equivalent to the English ""miss"" in Japanese, as in ""I miss my mother."" Does that mean that people in Japan are incapable of missing people? Of course not, but the underlying theory of Newspeak suggests otherwise. Once the party reduces the English language to a series of simple words with no nuance or subtlety of meaning, the idea goes, Thoughtcrime will be literally impossible. After all, how can one wish for freedom if the concept itself is impossible to articulate?Then there's the idea of the mutability of the past. The way the Party exerts its unbreakable control over the population is by virtue of the fact that they control all media - newspapers, radio, television, publishing of all sorts. If the Party wants to, say, claim that Big Brother invented the airplane, all they have to do is revise all relevant media to reflect their desired past, and then replace and destroy anything that disagrees with them. With no evidence that Big Brother didn't invent the airplane, all that's left is fallible human memory, and those who do think they remember the ""right"" version of the past will eventually die anyway. Whoever controls the present, the Party says, controls the future. And whoever controls the past controls the present. By remaking the past, the Party guarantees that they can never be gainsaid or proven to have erred in any way.Fortunately for us, Big Brother never had the internet to contend with. As anyone who's been online for a while knows, nothing on the internet ever goes away. Ever. The words of any leader or influential person are all there, in multiple copies, all of which can themselves be copied and distributed in mere seconds. While it is possible to fake a photograph, the awareness of that possibility, as well as the technology to suss out the fakes, are just as available to anyone who wants them. Even in cases where there are disputes about the past, or re-interpretations of past events, it is impossible for one version to systematically replace all others. While this sometimes results in competing versions of the past, the one with the most evidence tends to prevail.Continuing in that vein, the understanding that the Party controls all information about itself leads to a very interesting question that's not addressed in the book - is anything that is not directly witnessed by Winston Smith true? We are led to believe, for example, that there are three world powers - Oceanea, Eastasia and Eurasia - which are locked in a state of perpetual war. The nature of this war and how it serves the interests of these three nations is laid out in Goldstein's Book, which is the text of the Revolution that Winston and Julia want to join. But here's the thing - Goldstein's Book is an admitted fiction, written by the Party as a kind of honeypot to bring suspects through the last stages of their Thoughtcrime. So we have no proof that the world of Nineteen Eighty-four actually is laid out the way it appears.The Party could in fact dominate the world, using the pretext of war to keep the world's citizens terrified, needy and compliant. On the other extreme, Oceanea could just be Britain, turned in on itself like some super-accelerated North Korea, its borders sealed and its citizens kept in utter ignorance of the world outside. We don't know. We have no way of knowing, and neither do any of the characters in the book. Even the Inner Party members might not know the truth of their world, and wouldn't care if they did.One more thing, and I'll keep this one short - Doublethink. The ability to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind, believing in both of them simultaneously and yet being unaware that there's any conflict at all. Knowing, for example, that last week chocolate rations were at thirty grams, and at the same time knowing that this week they had been raised to twenty. All I can say here is to look at the current health care debate in the United States. Here's a fun game: see how often someone says, ""We have the best health care in the world,"" and then see how long it takes before they tell us that health care in the United States is irrevocably broken. Your average politician and pundit does this kind of thing all the time and, in accordance with the basic principles of Doublethink (also known as Reality Control), they immediately forget that they had done it.This game is much easier if you watch Glenn Beck for half an hour.There is just so much to be gleaned from this book. Probably the most important is this - the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-four is certainly not an impossible one, but it is unlikely. The people of that world allowed the Party to take over for them in a time of crisis, and in that sense this book is a warning to us all. It is a warning to keep the power that we have, and to resist the temptation to let a government decide who we should be.-------------------------------------------""I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.- Winston Smith, Nineteen Eighty-four-------------------------------------------"

Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (""The Party"") whose leader (actually dictator) is ""Big Brother."" The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of ""Oceania"" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of ""Newspeak"" which utilizes what is called ""doublethink.""Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and ""ungood."" Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in ones mind and believe in them both. The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink. But they also have other methods. For example, they have the ""Thought Police"" that investigate ""thoughtcrimes."" These are ""crimes"" of just having negative thoughts about The Party. Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls. Thus, ""Big Brother is watching you"" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party). O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did). He makes them pay for their ""crimes.""This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell. Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)Finally, this novel in a word is fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters)+++++"

Orwell showed his maturity as a writer and his evolution from Animal Farm (also great). 1984 shows the force of totalitarian governments and the faults of human nature. This should be read by any progressive-minded persons in the world.
192,9562910334,1984,,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,"fra7299 ""fra7299""",1/1,4.0,1311465600,Down with Big Brother,"So much has been written about Orwell's classic dystopian novel that it is tough to add anything new, many reviewers having offered well-thought of critiques. Orwell's futuristic novel makes one contemplate a world in which various elements of humanity--memories, important events, identities, personalities, family experiences--are rendered obsolete and transparent. 1984's afterword poses a question that is at the core of the novel: ""can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom, for dignity, for love--that is to say, can man forget that he is human?"", a question that the book's protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles with. Unlike some other dystopians (Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, The Giver, The Hunger Games), which share glimmers of hope for mankind, 1984 is a novel that leaves you shocked, upset, depressed and cold. Reading 1984 is a paranoid, hopeless kind of experience, particularly part three of the novel, but, to apply the oft used expression, it is a ""cautionary tale"", a dark parable to what could happen in a society devoid of humanness and ruled by oppressive forces.Orwell uses his main character, Winston, as a scapegoat to this disillusioned society. A sort of everyman, Winston experiences a rush of revolt during early on in the novel during the Two Minutes Hate, where the people stop to decry and lash out against Goldstein, an individual who advocates free speech and liberty. Winston takes measures to silently rebel against The Party: he scribbles thoughts on paper; he ventures outside the district; he buys an ""ancient"" relic, a glass piece, a link to the past. Despite his fatalistic attitude that he will eventually be caught and persecuted, he longs for information--and signs--- that will contradict the preachings of Big Brother; he ventures into a pub to engage an old man into a conversation about the world before the revolution, but is frustrated to find that the man only knows meaningless facts about the past. Winston later meets Julia, a woman who he distrusts initially, but comes to trust, as she despises everything about the Party. Winston enjoys the liaisons with Julia, and continues to try to understand more about the past and the possible existence of the Brotherhood. Instincts tell him that O'Brien, a man who works in the department, is the key.Orwell's 1984 is a work that epitomizes futuristic fears of a brainwashed society, evoking emotions on the part of the reader to root for the individual over civilization. As others have noted, 1984 depicts a pessimistic world view with a bleak message. It is, therefore, a bit of a downer to read. However, 1984 is powerful and has redeeming qualities, as evidenced in Winston's valiant struggle and attempt to retain his identity and his hatred for Big Brother; however, we see an inevitable, unalterable conclusion that still leaves us a little bit shaken.Similar to many of you, I was ""forced"" to read 1984 in high school; after rereading in college, the book's message was so much more powerful. It's a book that we often have to read, but it is a book that we should read."
193,9562910334,1984,,A5KRSBWGPDIC1,James May,4/4,5.0,1273622400,Perception and subversion,"To me it is somewhat surprising how few people think this is a book about perception and how that perception can be circumvented and subverted by the use of semantics. This should be obvious since Orwell actually takes the trouble to stop the book in mid-stride and lecture the reader about things like ""doublethink"". Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is also a book about perception, so much so that one of the Penguin Paperback editions has an entire introduction devoted to this idea. This is why Austen's book is still so timely and why ""1984"" is more timely than ever.The liberal left in America has had it's ability to reason literally overwhelmed in some instances by it's own political agenda. If Orwell could have I'm sure he would have coined the phrase, ""political correctness"". Political correctness blinds a person to any solution that does not fit in with their world view and so America has become a very troubled place indeed; in America, rape by one group can be the result of 'generational rage' and by another a predatory crime. Crime itself becomes politicized according to skin color. Words like 'colonialism', and 'imperialism' have had to be redefined by the Left in order to portray America in the light they wish. On the Left, it is taken for granted that all cultures are equal, separated only by opportunity and not by an inherent brilliance or lack of it; the benefits of multiculturalism, as a result, are taken for granted and not to be even questioned and America's immigration policy reflects this tenet.The political Left in America in the 21st century has taken on the delusional aspects of the Right in the 1960,s, seeing what it wishes to see and deriding all else with an airy, moral wave of the hand. Obsessed with race, the Left projects its own obsession with skin color onto millions of white Americans it doesn't even know.The Left in America projects it's own oppressive and smothering presence onto the country as a whole in the name of political freedom while absolving America's criminal oppressors of guilt; it is the 'system' that is guilty and the 'real' criminal. Criminals become heros, and lack of achievement celebrated in patronizing asides while success itself is deemed immoral without regard to the intent of the opposite side of that success. Thus failure attains morality in an Orwellian way that is most troubling. The left assigns morality wholesale in stereotypes that consign a banker to spiritual bankruptcy and a college student the opposite in a bigoted default system totally unaware of it's own racism and lack of perception of reality.The political Left in America is caught in the very perceptual trap that Orwell warned about; that trap is insidious and blinds one to it's very walls.Lack of achievement in America on the part of certain groups in relegated to a concept of a generational hangover while achievement is deemed a result of privilege; in the eyes of the Left, both groups are in fact exactly equal in terms of competence.In America, the Left would have you believe that everyone is exactly equal, the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" as it were in not a class struggle but an evening out of class, based on the 'coulda, woulda, shoulda' view that there must be a reason why some groups achieve and others do not aside from their own endemic value system or lack of it. In this scenario success itself achieves a type of tainted corruption while lack of success is to be excused, examined, mitigated and measured in every possible way but what counts and that is as Orwellian as it gets.""Big Brother"" isn't watching everyone, just those it deems watchable by skin color, success and and entirely de-contextualized cultural history every bit as subversive as Winston's job."

The way Herbert builds a society, and describes its many aspects, is unparalleled. The entire series is really about control and power. Who/what is in charge? The government? econmics? religion? technology? military? males? females? nature?Once the reader gets by the new vocabulary (interestingly based on Hebrew &amp; Arabic), and gets into the story (you may wish to have a scorecard), you will be completely absorbed and will not want to put the books down.P.S. Even though the movie is pathetic, I have to thank its creators. I had not yet read the books, but the story seemed compelling. I bought the first book the next day, and my literary life was changed.

It has everything in it that one could want: war, heroes, futuristic technology, villains, suspense, you name and Dune probably has it. I strongly recommend the book over the movie. There is far more detail in the novel and you gain a better understanding of who everyone is and what the different people are about. The copy of the book I have has a dictionary of words that you may not understand, and it has a map so you can see roughly where each scene takes place. Herbert was able to keep my attention throughout the whole book and the way it was written kept me glued to the book and it never seemed like it was as long as it really is, about 500 pages. I thought that it had strong similarities to a Star Wars type story; however, it was at the same time completely different.

Bernabo,7/11,4.0,1005696000,The weakest volume in Science Fiction's best series,"For me, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; is clearly the weakest book in Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; series. The problem from my perspective is a significant and radical shift in the character of Paul Muad'Dib. One of the things that particularly struck me in &quot;Dune&quot; was the sense in which Paul was similar to the Messiah awaited by the Jews: King David reincarnated to use the sword to sweep away the oppressors of his people. However, in &quot;Dune Messiah,&quot; Paul becomes more of a traditional Christ figure, down to the symbolic crucifixion that makes up the climax of the book. For me that was too much of a shift to accept, because I felt it undid one of the principle strengths of the original novel and all you have to do is put the two volumes side by side to see that this is not another epic novel.However, this does not mean that you should skip &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; as you work your way through the series, because it does set up several new elements that are ultimately more important than much of which was originally established (i.e, Duncan Idaho as a ghola, the twins, etc.). My strong recommendation has always been that you need to let time pass between each of Herbert's novels, because each one goes off in a new direction. I think that if you read them one after the other you simply cannot appreciate the strong points of each shift. So if you let time pass and then have a hankering to go back to Arrakis, I really believe you will be more open to the changes. Maybe the shock of the first change of direction has stayed with me, or the fact that the epic heights of the original &quot;Dune&quot; can never be equaled, but others have struggled through this second novel as well. However, everyone who has worked their way through the entire series has found it well worthwhile and we all would trade all the prequels for just one more volume from Frank Herbert."

Never before, even in the works of Tolkien has such a detailed and intricate world been created within the pages of the book. Arrakis and the world surrounding it is as real as our own as told through the cryptic yet poetic words of author Frank Herbert.So much can be said for what this book symbolizes. Not only does it take modern religions and translate them to the 110th century, not only does it argue philosophically with the nature of war, not only does it show fascism, communism, oligarchism and democracy in truly creative lights, but it also is one of the greatest adventure stories ever written. Paul and Jessica's journey through the desert (and eventually the Fremen way of life) will keep you interested the whole way through. It is a page turner until the very last page.Pick up the original Dune - and when you're done with that, read the next two. The three after that aren't for all tastes, but they too enrich the original even further (as do the prequels). And whatever you do - DON'T watch that god-awful 1984 movie version. If you really must watch one before you read the book, pick up the DVD of the 2000 Sci-fi miniseries.

This book picks up soon after the end of the first book. Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, main character in the first book and now emperor of the galaxy, has to deal with the results of the jihad he reluctantly released on the galaxy as well as the threats to his power from within his own palace. This book is more introspective than the first book, lacking most of the action and focusing instead on the foibles of the various characters and Herbert's musings on religion and politics.This book makes even more clear than the first book that Paul is not actually a hero, but a flawed man trying to cope with the enormity of his own power and the terrible bloodshed that is being committed in his name. The book is an essay on the dangers of absolute power and of the combination of religious and political power.Dune Messiah is also a story of the danger of a ruler becoming disaffected from those closest to him. The greatest danger to Paul comes from his disaffected wife. Paul also cuts off his beloved concubine from his decision-making and instead chooses a course which leads him towards personal destruction to save the galaxy. Perhaps Herbert's real message here is that domestic bliss is the key to happiness even for the all-powerful.Although this book is interesting, it is mainly filler between the masterpiece of Dune and the very good Children of Dune."

Dune is a masterpiece in the art of litarature just like any other more traditional classic such as The Great Gatsby. Dune is a reflection of the human condition and the implications thereof. Herbert explores the structure of society, religion, messiahs and god figures, honour, violence and so forth. Dune should be required reading in English classes, just as The Scarlett Letter is.

This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens afterChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)).Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.If you liked the books, I highly recommendFrank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)- it's a pretty good film adaptation ofDune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)andChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)."

Herbert's writing style was a joy to read, as he managed to find the delicate balance between detail and brevity, resulting in a fluid tale with both depth and raw emotion. What makes books like Dune and the Lord of the Rings series so great is that their respective worlds seem completely natural and real to the reader. Add some great action, plot twists, and wonderfully fleshed out characters, and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction, but modern literature as well. The incredible epic of the Muad'Dib, the deadly beauty of Arrakis and its inhabitants ... Dune is a novel I will never forget."
219,1556909330,Dune,,AEJ31WGHJ59C,Adam Shah,3/5,5.0,959731200,A Powerful Beginning To One of the Best Sci-fi Series,"Dune is Frank Herbert's masterpiece about Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, descendants of the House Atreus of Homeric fame, and his battles with his arch-enemies, the Harkonnens and, eventually, with the combined forces of the galaxy. The first of six books in an unfinished series--Herbert died before he brought his series to a conclusion--this book is the best of the series.Set far in the future, after humanity has not only left Earth, but humanity's origin is probably forgotten, the setting for this book is a neo-medieval world of strict castes, nobility and civilized warfare. The basic plot is rather standard: the young hero, Paul must come of age quickly when his father is treacherously killed by agents of the hated rivals. Since Paul loses his rightful throne, he must come of age among the violent indigenous population known as the Fremen.Although Herbert does write the action scenes well, the plot is not the strong suit of the book--later books in the series have better plots. The strongest part of the book is the theme of religion and politics that runs through the book. Herbert combines many different religions in this future galaxy including Christianity, Islam and various eastern religions.Herbert sets his hero, Paul, up as a messiah to the planetary population, the Fremen and possibly to the entire galaxy. This path may ultimately lead to a bloody jihad. However, Paul realizes that being a messiah is a dangerous path to take, ultimately ruinous to humanity as later books show. However, Paul's desire for power and the evilness of the alternate leaders, the corrupted by power emperor, the overly secretive female priesthood named the Bene Geserit, the no longer human Guild, and the entirely evil Harkonnens force Paul at every fork in the road to choose the path that leads to his anointing as messiah. Herbert thus creates a hero who is not as virtuous as he seems at first glance.A final note: as with any good first book in a sci-fi/fantasy series, there is much that remains unexplained in this book. Anyone who says that they understand the entire book is either lying or missed something. Some of the mysteries in this book become explained in later books, and one--the reference to Richese--in the prequel recently co-written by Herbert's son. There is also a great deal of mysticism and musing on the general state of humanity, some of which was, frankly, over my head.Therefore, if mysticism and unexplained mystery are not your cup of tea, then you should skip this book."

It is flawless, an exact clean copy. (I have the original Dune in paperback, and have read it several times). This Kindle version is perfect, down to the same misspellings in the original paper book. The fonts are even similar, including the slightly different font in the preludes to each chapter. This may seem trivial, but it the number of errors in Kindle versions of books like this is astounding.Some might quibble over the pricing, because if you really wanted to, you could get a paperback version cheaper than the Kindle version. However, to me, the value of having all of the Dune books in a nice thin package of the Kindle more than makes it worth the extra buck.There is a interesting point in the book in which Paul Atriedes gets a tiny little scroll-like reader of the O.C. Bible as a gift. He had to use some type of magnifying device to read it. This was, ironically, one of the only future technology concepts that Frank Herbert ""guessed wrong"" about.

Dune is a masterpiece, don't misunderstand, but Messiah goes much deeper. Dune was about Paul, rising to become the leader of the Fremen, and focused on his power and prescience. In Messiah, we find out that prescience is not a gift, and is much more a curse. Paul Muad'dib goes through many trials in this book, but the recurring theme is how his prescience warps him to become less of a God, and more of a man. Paul was not perfect, as we find out, and while the book is more philosophical than action-packed, it is a much better experience. Many say that because it is not like Dune, it is not good. The good in this book is hidden. The conspiracy to kill Paul, the hidden intentions of Reverend Mother Mohiam, Paul's mind, Alia's abrasiveness, Hayt's true purpose, the list goes on. To understand these things is to understand the entire Dune series, and to say that this book is not as good as Dune is to admit that you didn't understand Messiah for what it was."

What makes it impressive is that in an era of technology-obsessed sci-fi, Herbert succeeds in fleshing out the characters of Paul, Jessica, and a few others; Dune was the best-described planet in science fiction until Robinson's Mars came along three decades later.The problems? It's rather difficult to get American readers to care about a feud between two aristocratic families in a future Empire, culminating with the hero making himself king, so Herbert has to turn Harkonnen into the ultimate heavy (including making him homosexual, which dates the story) while making Leto and Duncan into cardboard heroes. And sometimes the mumbo-jumbo gets ridiculous: in the first chapter Herbert says ""The statement violated what his mother called his INSTINCT FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS"", as if there was something exotic about having moral standards; why not just say Paul disagreed? And, unfortunately, the mumbo-jumbo dominates most of the sequels, as reflected in titles like ""The God-Emperor of Dune""."

234,1556909330,Dune,,ACK3TZEDR258N,Travis Stein,3/4,5.0,1212624000,An excellent book for any fan of science fiction!,"When I started off reading Dune 3-4 years ago, I gave up about 200 pages in just because it seemed too complex to me at the time. Years later, I came back to it again because the summertime is quite boring with no job/school.Suffice to say, not only did I understand what was going on a lot better, I actually loved the book in the end.Dune is set on a planet known as Arrakis, which happens to be the gem of the interstellar empire that House Atreides and Harkonnen are in. As it turns out, Arrakis is the sole source of spice/melange that is vital for traveling the galaxy as it helps to sharpen psychic powers and vision for pilots.Recently, the control of Arrakis has been shifted from House Harkonnen to House Atreides. House Harkonnen does not want to give up its source of wealth and power quietly and plots to make matters very turbulent for House Atreides on Arrakis.The Baron, head of House Harkonnen, plots to rid Arrakis of the Atreides anyway he can and eventually sends the young heir to the throne (Paul) into the hostile desert sands. Paul meets the Fremen (sand-people) during his time in the deserts and ends up, no thanks to the Baron, surviving and goes about biding his time until he can somehow convince these people to fight with him to get his rightful throne back on Arrakis.A sub-plot to this book is the fact that Paul Atreides is much more than a mere overthrown duke. He is the product of a plan by the Bene Gesserits, a class of humans highly trained in the psychic arts, to breed one of their own that can see into depths of the future and mind far better than any of their typically female members can.This book was a real joy to read. Sometimes it was tough getting bogged down in all of the characters and places, etc. However, it was not as difficult to read the second time around and I thoroughly look forward to the reading of the second installment in Dune Messiah."
235,1556909330,Dune,,A1VTHUZIN04QQW,Jeremiah J. Timmins,2/2,5.0,1021420800,A triumph. PS - Readers are the ultimate critics,"Frank Hebert wrote Dune, only to be denied by at least twelve publishers before he connected to a publisher of technical manuals, who took a gamble and published Dune.It was panned and trashed by almost all the critics who initially read it. But the first printing sold out anyway, and the second printing did too. People were picking up on the quality of this amazing book. Hebert starting mail from fans describing their fascination with Dune. Then he got a call from a reporter asking him if he was trying to start a cult. His answer was ""God no!""It's amazing that this book almost never existed, because this is one of the best books ever written. The novel is flawlessly conceived and visualized. The characters are very convincing. I don't think this book was a metaphor for the world situation. The Fremen borrow heavily from the Arab world, but look at the Arab world, much of it is desert. If Europeans who fight in the desert end up using Bedouin techniques and use Arab words like wadi and hammadas, then anyone living and fighting in a desert environment would naturally use the techniques and vocabulary of the world's best desert dwellers, who happen to be Arabs.Dune does an amazing job of combining love, hate, economics, politics, and destiny. There are so many good storylines in this book that an average author could have derived at least five books from it. The concept of the Kwisatz Haderach alone, the ultimate being, is handled expertly here. What would an ultimate being, a living, breathing man who is worshipped as God, be like? How could you make the ultimate being, and how could you prepare the masses for their messiah?Describing this book in a short review is nearly impossible. However, I do have to talk about the spice melange. I'm not sure what psychoactives Herbert ever tried in his life, or even if he ever did anything, but the effects of melange are like the effects of a popular but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold. Anyone who's read the book knows spice is the cornerstone of the Empire, as its mind-expanding powers allow the human mind to manipulate space and time. The spice also has the power to unlock genetic memories, extend longevity, and is used recreationally. In a very subtle and engaging way, Herbert explicitly prescribes the use of mind-expanding drugs. Mua'dib definitely follows William Blakes advice when he says ""The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,"" as Mua'dib completes his development as the Kwizatz Haderach by ingesting a toxic overdose of spice, and then experienes a 'trip' in which the deepest mysteries of life are revealed to him, and he becomes nearly omniscient.The love stories and relationships within this book are as compelling as in it.As far as the bad guys in the book go, the Emperor Shaddam the IV, and his tool the Baron Harkonnen are excellent. The Baron is truly terrifying, and he makes a horrible image. When telling his nephew, Rabban, how to govern Arrakis, he says ""You must be always hungry, always thirsty. Like me."" He then lovingly strokes his rolls of fat. The Baron's sexual tastes and appetite are also sickening, yet they are described implicitly, unlike in the recent ""prequel"" books by Herbert's son. At the same time, the Baron never falls into the cliches of most bad guys, and the scene in which Jessica and Paul are able to excape his cluthes is done in a very convincing way. They didn't escape through the palace air shafts or because the Baron designed an overly complex spectacle death for them.All in all, buy this book, since it's most likely the best sci-fi you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.-- JJ Timmins"

Herbert does much of the same...Dune is a desert land that requires a hard existence. The Fremen, people that naturally habit this land, are a troubled people that exist for nothing more than to create life from nothing. Paul, the main character, is adopted by these people, and becomes their spiritual leader. It is a good story that is very origonal (I haven't read any other story that compares). I find that as you read fantasy books, many of the ideas presented by todays top writers are borrowed from one another (just written in a different way, with different characters). I don't know about you, but this gets old after a while.Anyways, I started reading dune 5 years after I bought the book. I had tried reading the story many times over those five years, but I'd get lost or disinterested in the story because of all the made up language, philosophical mumbo jumbo, and from the fact that basically, the book starts out slow. After getting through the first 50 to 100 pages, the story becomes very involved and very real. It was written very well. I understand why this is the highest selling sci-fi of all time.For those that enjoy fantasy, this book is clasified as a sci-fi, but really, it is in between. It doesn't have the space-flying-fighting juck that i normally would associate with a sci-fi novel. It's definitally worth the money and the time. Buy this book. You'll enjoy it."

The Atriedes receive the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune, from the Harkonnens because the Harkonnens want to be in favor with the emporer. After the Atriedes move to Arrakis from their safe homeworld of Caladan, this doesn't come with out cost though. This is when the story starts to get action packed. At this point in the story things start to get complicated.Something about ""Dune"" is that it has so much detail. Every thing in the world has it's own name in the ""Dune"" universe and is so detailed. However, this means that it takes a while to get into the story and understand everything. New characters are introduced continuously, and the reader thinks ""Where did you come from?"". Also, many plot twists add to the confusion.

Last, there is the Planet Dune.Dune is a perfect world. Dune requires perfection. If you are less than perfect you die. The enviorment is as unforgiving as space. Basically, it has no water. A world like Dune should either keep people away or invite terra forming. However, this is not done. It is on Dune that ""Spice"" is found. Spice's other name is Melange.Spice is the driving force in this book. Spice is everything. Spice allows the Guild pilots to peer into the future to allow faster-than-light spaceships to navigate in space. Spice allows very long life for humans who take the drug. The trouble is Spice is addictive. If you quit taking Spice you die.Dune is the only source of Spice. The economy of the universe depends on the free flow of Spice.Frank Herbert's Dune is a perfect book because it takes place nearly 8,000 years in the future. It removed from our modern world by sheer volume of time. Everything has changed. The Catholic church has survived as the only religion but not as something we would recognise. The ""Orange Catholic"" Bible is an amalgamation of all the worlds religions. Guilds control working life. Planets have been populated by people, and have been populated for thousands of years. An emperor governs the galaxy. However, his power depends more on alliances power rather than his own monopoly of power.Herbert's Dune is full of political forces fighting for the planet. All of them want the Spice and raw power.What makes the book so timeless, it was written over 40 years past, are some parts read like how the people of today would act them out. Example, people in the future use personal ""shields"" for protection. If a laser hits a shield the energy release produces an near nuclear sized explosion. One of Paul's bodyguards rigs up a shield because some attacking enemy troops are using lasers in an attack.After the explosion a briefing is given to Baron Harkonnen. You can just see the word ""spin"" leap off the pages. The Baron ends up thinking to himself ""it was pretty bad"" despite the briefer's wish to give a different impression to Baron Harkonnen.The book is full of examples like that. It's over 10,000 ACE and some basic things about people have not changed. A Fremen woman steals damp rags, sells the squeezed water to beggars, and commits pilferage against Paul's family. The Fremen see Duke Leto risk his life to save the crew of a Spice mining machine, the Fremen are impressed with his concern for his men.Another thing is thinking machines, computers, are banned in the future. Why? They are used to oppress people and a revolt led to their destruction. Amazing that Frank Herbert in the early 1960s had to foresight to see the oppression that we will be living with in the future.Paul himself is a perfect character for Dune. The book starts with Paul as a young teenager. The book concludes with his as a young man, sure of himself and in control of all around. We get to see a man who was bred, literally, to be summation of all people in the universe. Paul makes the connection between the worms and Spice. Paul builds up the Fremen to be the ultimate soldiers in the Universe.My poor words do not do justice to this book. I re-read Dune ever five years. Yes, the book is that good. I always find something I miss in the book.Now, Dune has been made into a wretched big screen movie. That was back in '82 and I suppose the makers of the film just threw money at Frank Herbert until he agreed to make the movie. It's terrible. Avoid it. Dune has been made into a Science-Fiction channel movie. It's not bad. It's not in the same class as the book, what mini-series is? However, if you don't want to spend the energy reading Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune then they are not too bad.Warning, I gave up reading the Dune series after God Emperor of Dune. Past that point, over 5,000 years removed from Dune, you wonder if the government that poor Arrakis (it's not Dune at that point) got would have been any worse if the Harkonnen been in charge.Dune is a perfect book. It should be one 100 best books of the 20th Century.Five stars"

This is not to say that Sci-Fi as a genre is no longer worth reading, but nearly all authors of the genre now conceptualize of themselves as 'Science Fiction authors', and this was not always the case.Dune is not, first and foremost, science fiction. It is commentary. It is some of the most biting and intelligent commentary on religion and government (as well as a plethora of other subjects, ranging from trade unions to ecology) ever written.The fact that it is cloaked in a fantastical future should have no more bearing on our treatment of it than does, say, the fictions of 1984.Dune is one of the greatest stories ever written. This is my firm belief, having read more books than I can care to count. The characters are deep and passionate. Entirely unlike anyone most of us have ever known, yet immenently believable all the same. They are the sort of people we are assured must exist; the sort of people we know mankind is capable of producing.The villains are evil, the heroes are good. There is no ambiguity, but that is because the purpose of the book is not to shed light on the distinctions of good and evil within individual humans, but to investigate the power-plays among people on the grander level.One thing I would caution against when reading this book: commit yourself to reading it. Many find the first half of the book quite slow. Some would even say tedious. Push through it, I beg you. For if you do not, you are cheating yourself of a great joy.And when you finish Dune, continue to the rest of the books in the series. Part of the reason the first half can seem to drag is because Herbert was establishing a universe of incredible complexity. He was thinking in the long term, over a span of six or seven books.And he succeeded in building that universe. The universe of Arrakis. Of Dune. And it will live on in people's minds for many years to come."

The movie came out about that time and I was lost in it also. Recently I picked this book back up and found it a joy not only to read, but to complete.The only thing I can add to these already glowing reviews for &quot;Dune&quot; is if you had tried reading it when you were younger and couldn't muddle through it, try it when you're older and have a little more experience and knowledge (and patience) about life and it's workings and it should be a lot easier. It's worth another attempt-or two-for it is one of those rare experiences that will change your life, and make you see the world in a different way, enriching it.Also I recommend checking out the movie before you start the book. Even though it only touches upon the events in &quot;Dune&quot;, skimming over them almost in a superficial way, it will help you to understand the deeper actions in the novel, and bring together some of the more confusing elements-of the &quot;plots within plots&quot;, that incredible tapestry that Herbert succeeds in weaving so well.

""Dune"" was already a classic when i read it in 1981, and unlike many SF books from the cusp of speculative fiction's New Wave, its impact remains as timeless now as it did then. Herbert grounded his sprawling tale of imperial politics and ecological revolution in a character story worthy of Tolstoy, downplaying the nuts-and-bolts aspects of his milieu's technology in a way that prevents ""Dune"" from seeming stale, even today.As with many of the most seminal works of speculative fiction and fantasy, the most amazing thing about ""Dune"" is how close it came to never seeing print, having been passed over by twenty publishers before being initially picked up by a nonfiction small press. In the canon of F&SF;, there are few books whose importance literally cannot be understated. ""Dune"" is one of those. Without it, the world of imaginative literature would not be the same.I break with a lot of Herbert fans in my complete dispassion for the later ""Dune"" books, including the capstone of the original trilogy, ""Children of Dune"". To anyone who hasn't read the books, my recommendation is always to read ""Dune"" and ""Dune Messiah"" back to back as one continuous narrative, with the sequel bringing Herbert's vision to a satisfying and heartbreaking end."

It is not only a quantum leap ahead of anything from its time, it is arguably still today rarely equaled and even more seldom surpassed, in spite of the fact that Frank Herbert's successors have his own work (and all of the ensuing derivative work from the intervening decades) to guide them.Although Herbert originally wrote six Dune novels, I have come to think of the first three as a single work, simply because I never feel like I am done reading if I stop at the end of the first or even the second book. So this review should be considered to regard Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune. If you are not willing to read at least those three (and the second three, while worthwhile, are much less contiguous and less indispensable), you are missing a good deal of what is great about this work.The first word that comes to mind to describe Dune is ""smart."" Herbert's main writing innovation is the amount that he leaves out. Although the POV is omniscient, it is still the POV of an omniscient in Herbert's world and not in ours. So, there is much that could have been written to acclimate a visitor from our world to the world of Dune. Herbert's mastery is in leaving it all out, and still leaving you totally aware (at least, if you are paying careful attention) of what you didn't read explicitly. The author never underestimates his readers, instead making leaps in narrative, character arc, and history, and expecting you to follow. You find yourself rising to the challenge, and feel smarter just by virtue of having read and understood.The characters are also ""smart."" I have read science fiction from childhood on, and the more I read, the more I am amazed at how intelligent the characters in Dune are. There are factions within factions, schemes within schemes, bitterly opposed and fully developed characters locked in truly epic struggles for their own survival, the survival of their respective dynasties, and the success of plans whose maturity is measured in millennia. And the best part is, none of these characters need to be described as geniuses--we already know that just by reading.There is an old political joke that a candidate, when asked how he will address a given problem, answers ""I'll just imagine a guy smarter than me, then do what he would do."" Obviously, it's not that easy. The same concept holds in writing fiction--it is impossible for a character to be both well developed and smarter than the author. This is doubly true in science fiction, where the myriad plot and character threads must intertwine with a society truly alien from our own, which nonetheless has a dazzling array of strictures in its religious, political, economic, and metaphysical aspects, all of which must be consistent and believable. Herbert set an extremely ambitious goal in creating the world of Dune, and the cast of characters with which to populate it. And he accomplishes that goal in grand style. It is the literary equivalent of knocking one out of the park, in the bottom of the ninth of World Series game 7.If you like science fiction and have not read Dune, you will be astounded at what you have been missing. If you do not (yet) like science fiction, you may find it both too dense and too vague, as a certain amount of literacy in the genre is required before you can confidently fill in the blanks and make the leaps required by the text. It is the book equivalent of a movie where you can't miss a moment, for fear of not understanding something later on. That said, you shouldn't let the book intimidate you, as it is a real pleasure to read. If I got more out of it in my 30's than I did in my teens, that is only to be expected. But whenever I have read it, I have been not only entertained, but broadened, awakened--in a word, edified."

I read &quot;Dune&quot; (and all its sequels) when I was 21, turning 22. This was after I'd seen the books in the shop for so many years. As a youngster I was attracted by the airbrushed covers, with the giant worms, the robed religious followers, the sand. The books looked frighteningly thick though.I finally gave &quot;Dune&quot; a go in 1998. Arthur C. Clarke was right to compare this novel to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The planet Arrakis is described in as much detail as Middle-Earth, the story is monumental. When Paul Atreides' father is assassinated by the rival House Harkonnen, Paul flees into the desert with his mother. They join the native Fremen and eventually Paul leads them to greatness. There's a lot more to the story than that of course, but it's too much to describe in a paragraph.If you plan to read the entire series its probably best if you space the novels out a bit, read a couple of different books in between. It will give a better sense of time passing. I read the books one after the other. By the time I finished I thought I would see a Reverend Mother in the street. I found the last two books a bit slow, but I felt obliged to finish them. The original &quot;Dune&quot; is by far the best of the series.I've also seen the film (I think David Lunch did the best he could under the circumstances). We have the computer game too.

Just get to how I was introduced to the book, what I liked and didn't like and maybe some spoilers. Enjoy!I was introduced to Dune after googling ""best sci-fi books of all time"". So when Dune popped up at the top of almost every list I saw I decided that I had to read it. There were some interesting concepts I loved but ultimately the book didn't really do it for me.::: Things I liked :::-The concept of Arakis (Dune) being a desert world with a unique ecosystem etc.-The idea of blue-eyed Freeman with stillsuits and all their other abilities got me really excited.-How the worms and spice were related was fascinating!::: Things I didn't like :::-This book has extensive politicking in it and does not really provide any background for why the political groups are at each other's throats-I found myself confusing characters and I realized half way through my read that it was because they were forgettable or didn't seem to have real human reactions and emotions.-Prepare yourself for a long wind up. I read through about 40% of the book until the main characters even reached the desert and culture of the Freeman began to be revealed.-Granted this is the 40 year anniversary edition of this book but the dated language and flow really made it a chore to read sometimes.-Overall the plot was a bit vague with visions and mystical characters that never really receive and explanation. The writer forces you to pick up tidbits and try to piece them together yourself.::: The Verdict :::Ultimately there was nothing that held me to finish this book. I always give a book at least a 50% completion before setting it aside and making a judgement. With Dune I gave it 60% because I really wanted it to be good. In the end I set it aside and decided to watch the tv/movie adaptations to see if the ending is really worth the trudge through the book. I really had high hopes for the ""all time best sci-fi book of all time"" but found an old drab of a book that could be awesome if the right person came back to revive it."

The Atreides are immediately aware of this and the tenacity of their situation, especially with their rivals and the former custodians of Dune: House Harkonnen.All this is backdrop to the real story though: the plight of a young man named Paul Atreides heir to House Atreides. Paul is the son of the Duke Atreides and the Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and bound concubine to the Duke. Sharing both his father's noble upbringing and his mother's special powers, Paul is quickly identified as a powerful future leader and potentially the messiah of ancient Bene Gesserit lore: the Kwisatz Haderach.When the Atreides are betrayed by the Emperor, who reveals his true allegiance to House Harkonnen, a gripping saga commences that challenges Paul to survive to avenge his family against an empire bent on destroying him.The entire Dune series is engaging and complete in its imagined universe that each book is a treasure in its own right. The first book however stands even above the rest as the fantastically imagined beginning to the legacy of Dune. It is a must-read for anyone."

279,1556909330,Dune,,A2W2E6BPPYZO0T,YA book lover,1/1,4.0,1271289600,"A masterpiece of science fiction, and rightfully so","I like books for different reasons - characters, writing style, exciting plot. I will remember ""Dune"" for its remarkable world-building.Dune (or Arrakis) is a desert planet. It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe.Having finished ""Dune,"" I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what ""Lord of the Rings"" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against.The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out.The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating.The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved.But these negatives aside, ""Dune"" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember ""Dune"" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it."

It must be in the nicest sense of that term.I remember being young, near to thirty, and reading the first time, comparing impressions with friends in the quiet, hands-on moments at our r&d; work.Perhaps we didn't feel the sweep of the original Dune, though in another way it is actually there -- behind, and in the spaces opened by many observations in the text. And it didn't seem to compare with the adventures of Leto and Ghanima and the D-wolves, though today for all that the Children of Dune book is important, it is lesser.In Dune Messiah, the depth of individual story is drawn almost as with Asian brushes: swift, naturally spreading strokes, that you take a moment with to let the understanding come to you, how evocative. There is not summary, yet also there are summaries of whole thoughts, as in the sad ending not of Paul, but of Bijaz, whose power as a person and character just give glimpses of Frank Herbert's breadth of achievement.I have never been able to understand the later books after Herbert died, though there can be a certain fascination in some of them, and now think that they are simply very different works, as if a very different historian had been read to us. Then there is credit where due.Of Frank Herbert's deep and long creation, it's apparent also how he took different avenues himself, perhaps guided by editors, by 'results' for this Dune Messiah particularly. He had a life to support, and could no doubt find fun and satisfaction in putting forward what people most seemed to want to hear, all the way to Miles Teg, who was a great creation also.Would that he could have pursued the tracks of Dune Messiah further in some places and ways, and perhaps he did -- the rest of the series I also have before me to read over. What he did here shows the soul there was behind it all, and it is a thanking matter indeed to meet him so.Highly recommended, and as you see, for reading 'again'."

Set in the future, this novel covers themes ranging from politics to economics, religion and philosphy to environmentalism. In other words, Herbert is a genius and you will be able to tell this within the first few pages.The central theme is that of messianic religions, and the effects of such. Because of the fact that Paul Attredies (the main character) is a messiah, we get to see his point of view on being one. Herbert deals extensively with the feelings such a person might feel about having a fate which is unaviodable.The characters Herbert created are outstanding. You'll hate the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and love Paul. You'll be intrigued by the guildsmen and in awe of the Bene Geseritt.If you like dense plots, this is the book for you. There are more layers to this novel than you can count on both hands. I should warn you that you will miss many many things after the first reading.

I don't know what it is about it, but it has never appealed to me. To illustrate: a friend of mine bought me this book four years ago with the promise that it would be worth my while and I have only recently read it.If DUNE is a good representation of Science Fiction, then I have been missing out. What a great book. I always hesitate to voice my opinion on books that are time tested. I mean, do you really need someone to tell you that the LORD OF THE RINGS are good books. Still, if you, like me, eschew Science Fiction for fantasy or other fare, then hopefully my review will persuade you.I enjoyed the technique the author used of dropping the reader into a new world together with the protagonist. We learn as he does. This keeps the pace of the book brisk. Other authors have employed this technique less effectively.The world - Dune - is original and intriguing. The originality of the book is probably its greatest selling point. I have not seen, or imagined this type of world (apart from the obvious homage in Beetlejuice).I thought that the development of characters - both as to the insight into their character and their acquisition of skills and powers - was also a great contributor to my enjoyment of the book. One gets a good feel for the motivation and reasoning behind all of the characters actions, be they prominent or not. Also, the book does not waste a great deal of time developing the protagonist. His progression as a powerful figure progresses quickly. This I think lends itself to better story telling.My experience with many fantasy books is that the development of super-powers IS the story. Once the protagonist has developed the powers, then the final conflict is brief and ultimately unsatisfying. Here, there is a story to be told after the pieces are in place, so to speak. It works.In all, I think that whether you're a fan or Science Fiction or not, you will enjoy DUNE. I whole-heartedly recommend it. It has inspired me to read ENDER'S GAME. Another Sci-Fi book I've put off for years. I'll report back to you on my impressions of it here."

Even if he veered at times dangerously close to fascism, which he does, and so does that Nazi Heinlein.

Having grown up as very young with the ""Dune 2"" real time strategy game on the PC which I have fond memories of I later on always had a strong suspicion that the Dune books must be truly great -- but for some reason I never got around to reading the books despite reading a lot of other fiction. Finally I bought all the books in the Dune series -- I was THAT certain this series must be so good I would want to buy all of them anyway; or so I'd been told, things like ""So you thought Hyperion was good? You should read Dune."".I was deeply disappointed. For starters I didn't like the tone and style of writing, but I didn't like Hyperion immediately either, and I went into the book with enthusiasm, a truly open mind and embraced every idea when I started reading and didn't care if things didn't make sense at first.I'm soon finished with the second book now and here are my thoughts: Dune has little or nothing to do with science fiction and technology, it has everything to do with politics, religion and what I'd call magic -- the abilities of e.g. the protagonists to manipulate their own bodies and see into the future with no explanation whatsoever or even vague references to physics is hard to grasp. It is even told that the magic spice can ""bend space"", presumably as implied by GR. It is even harder to accept that in a high tech, interstellar fairing civilization computers are outlawed and knives are extremely effective weapons.As said already ""The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world."", if you can accept this as science fiction in addition to a lot of seemingly absurd babble, then you will probably enjoy the book.The author seems to employ cheap plot devices to elude the burden of having to speculate on the technology of the future. E.g. all computers are illegal due to a ""jihad"" that banned them a long time ago. Apparently digital guidance computers are not needed to navigate nor control the massive interstellar spacecraft that are present in the novel but never discussed in detail. Instead they are navigated using one of the several magic forces of the ""spice"" in addition to so-called ""navigators"". The most sad thing is that exactly how this (and basically anything else too) works is not even mentioned as far as I can recall.To imagine strong AI is forbidden is possible, but to imagine that not only weak AI (expert systems) are illegal but ALL computers altogether are illegal? Give me a break. Supposedly ""Ornithopters"" are used as aircraft on Dune, with no explanation as to why this is cheaper and more effective than regular aircraft -- however, are we meant to believe these aircraft are operated with analog electronics? Is all communication analog too?""JIHAD, BUTLERIAN: (see also Great Revolt) -- the crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots begun in 201 B.G. and concluded in 108 B.G. Its chief commandment remains in the O.C. Bible as ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.""""Since computers per se are never mentioned in the book as far as I can recall I can only interpret the Butlerian Jihad as outlawing ALL computers -- as is actually stated too in the quoted text. Are we really meant to believe that an interstellar civilization operates a vast network of huge, massive spacecraft of all kids, without using any form of digital computers? All sensors, attitude control, thrusters, life support systems, GN&C;, communication, command and data handling are all analog, and somehow fed through a mutated creature that is this ""navigator"", who uses a magical spice to fold the very fabric of spacetime itself? And none of this needs to be even remotely explained or even mentioned how actually works?Other works of science fiction often refrain from explaining the inner workings of arbitrary technology too, but in those cases the underlying concepts or ideas that are implied (or stated explicitly) are often familiar ones that are easy to imagine -- the reader can fill in the voids and gaps on his/her own, however with Dune I'm unable to do this. It seems impossible.It is perhaps at least as hard to accept that weapons are near useless, due to everyone in a military situation being equipped with a ""shield"", which supposedly causes subatomic fusion upon being struck by directed energy from a weapon. To suppose that nothing, not particle weapons nor energy weapons are useful at all, because of a shild that can stop ANYTHING, seems not only unrealistic but makes again for a poor excuse as means to exclude such weapons from the universe altogether.In all Dune seems more like a desert fantasy universe with the technology so distant and so remote that it is felt as if it is not even there at all. The ideas and concepts seem more magical than scientific.Due to the age of the work I expected a space opera/soft science fiction -- little talk about technology and science, but as I've tried to explain there is less than that, there is so little science in the book that fantasy is perhaps a better term.Although if you can live with what I've briefly mentioned so far, the rest of the book must be said to be great, but there are plenty of other reviews that deal with what the book is really about.

Infrequently, especially in the world of Sci-Fi. It is the accomplishment of all of these that allows &quot;Dune&quot; -- if not its sequels -- to hold its own among all the great stories of our time.Many others here have written about Herbert's brilliant character development and his incredible creativity in conceiving the world of &quot;Dune&quot;. I would like to call your attention, though, to the satisfaction that comes from reading a well thought out story that is told deftly and with passion. All too often in Science Fiction (and non-Sci Fi for that matter) we see books premised on a few ideas that go nowhere as a story. Authors have very original ideas that suck us into the book, tease us along for a while, and then end the story with a fizzle, dragging us into a morass of over-wrought characters and needlessly complicated plot-lines. Neal Stephenson's &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; is a perfect example. Your feeling after the first 50 pages is, &quot;What a cool idea! This is great!&quot; But the book ends up taking you on a long, slow downhill ride with an ending that is nowhere close to the brilliance of the original concept.&quot;Dune&quot; does not do this. It lifts you gently into the main story, making sure to point out the relevant characters and side-plots as you go along, builds your anticipation over its entirety, and continually keeps you fresh and interested. The resolution is complete and timely, and doesn't leave you slogging through 20 meaningless pages at the end. When you finish, you can look back and say, &quot;What a great story, and what a great storyteller.&quot;I believe the goal of all fiction should be to make readers say that, and with &quot;Dune&quot; Frank Herbert has definitely made me say it."

Generally when I get a challenge like that, I follow through on it.So what were my thoughts on this book upon finishing it? Well it was an interesting read. While I liked various parts of it, other parts were just boring. And yes, perhaps my dislike of straight science fiction clouded my feelings and made it impossible to read with an unbiased eye, but in the long run, the book just simply didn't do much for me.The ideas behind the Bene Gesserit teachings and the Fremen way of life I found immensely intriguing. The Litany against Fear especially caught my eye and left me thinking. In truth it was the thoughtful, intellectual moments in the book that were the most enjoyable for me. Herbert poses some truly deep philosophical ideas within this novel and those ideas held my interest far more than the actual plot of the story. Try as I might, I just didn't care what happened to the characters or the power struggle between political houses. And once Paul became the ""messiah"", I lost what little respect I felt towards him.At the same time, I struggled with Herbert's writing style. To me it was dry and extremely confusing. The general pacing of events took far to long and often times I found myself wanting to scream, ""Get on with it already!"" Not that that would have done much good. In fact, by the time I finished with the story itself, I chose to completely skip the appendices and glossary. Plus, the inner monologues just killed me. Almost all of Herbert's characters engage in inner contemplation to the point where it was overkill.Yes, Herbert created a world that truly was unique, however the actual story just didn't work for me. I've heard that it has been compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd go with Tolkien long before I'd ever choose Herbert."

301,1556909330,Dune,,A33T4OQBH7UCTZ,Aj,1/5,5.0,1110844800,Review Of The Book,"In Dune the author Frank Herbert used 3rd person omniscient. He shares the perspectives, thoughts, and feelings of multiple characters. Frank Herbert uses symbolism as a literary device. One of the symbols he uses in the book is water. The Fremen refer to blood as ""the body's water,"" suggesting that the Fremen view water as the blood of the environment. When Thufir Hawat agrees to join the Fremen, he enters the ""bond of water,"" rather than a blood oath. People show their loyalty to one another by spitting or sharing water. Paul and Jessica, during their time with the Fremen, engage in many rituals that involve water. For example, Paul accepts the water of Jamis's corpse after he kills him. After drinking the water, Paul is baptized into the culture of the Fremen, and he is reborn as a leader in their world. For the Fremen, water and life are the same.One of the themes Frank Herbert uses in the book is religion and power. Religion represents a source of comfort and power throughout the novel. Paul pursues the same goals as Kynes, but uses his religious power over the Fremen as their messiah to gain control of the entire Imperium. Paul possesses mystical abilities that go above and beyond a simple heightened awareness or intelligence, but his clever exploitation of religion is his most powerful advantage. Paul's manipulation of religion and the calculated use of legends contrived by the Bene Gesserit allow him to rise to the position of emperor. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science-fiction and fantasy."

303,1556909330,Dune,,A671GGV9ALOJL,Arwythur,0/0,5.0,1323475200,Dune: A Classic Epic,"If you do nothing else in your life, read this series, including the works continued by Mr. Herbert's son. It is a feast for the mind, and a thousand lessons in the bit's and pieces that make up our collective unconscious."
304,1556909330,Dune,,A2H3F2VMWQKWQB,Harry,0/0,5.0,1354838400,Dune: The Majestic Desert of Science Fiction,"There has always been writings of science fiction, but the novel Dune, by Frank Herbert, sets a new standards. Dune does more than create a fantastic feudalistic universe, Herbert uses his characters to express key aspects of humans. The novel starts with a young boy, Paul, the son of a strong-willed Duke, who is about to move to a dangerous new planet. Along with this stress Paul has been visited by an old woman called a Reverend Mother who tests if he is a ""real"" human by seeing if he had control of his mind. After this quick but significant trial Paul is told that he is to become a great prophet (who can see the past through his ancestry and predict the future). The novel consists of his evolution from this boy pondering the aspects of human nature and what is means to be human to a leader with foresight in a world of chaos.Herbert does a great job of emphasising human behavior through the characters that value power, greed, honor and just water. The men plotting against Paul's father want to claim the emperor's place by killing Paul's father. Paul's father is a leader of men. He inspires intense honor and loyalty with his commanders and servants. The indigenous population of Dune called the Fremen who live in the desert value water more than anything else because there so little on the planet. Herbert comments on extremists by emphasizing the pure focus the Fremen have on water and how the religious dream of their planet maintaining a water cycle is enough for the Fremen to give up their lives. He also brings in the philosophy of harsh conditions create the strongest people, by having the feared warriors of the emperor come from a once prosperous planet turned into a slave planet, for the purpose of breeding superior warriors.Sometimes when reading this book the reader might feel that they are receiving a psychology lecture instead of an actual story. Especially in the beginning when Paul is receiving lessons from his mentors. ""A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it."" Also Paul, when he has the need to put aside his emotions to think clearly, has several insights into how to overcome emotion, ""Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. ... Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."" These mini quotes of wisdom can sometimes make the story seem to be prolonged by the time Herbert spends integrating them with his story.Even though this book has a lot of philosophy it contains a mystical world much like the captivating epic Star Wars. Dune, however, came before Star Wars. Dune could be argued to be the novel that set the standard for current science fiction pieces. Dune uses its futuristic world to predict like Paul does, the future our own world could become. Dune is realistic, though, in that people act rationally and many aspects of the futuristic culture are explained with principles known today. Herbert uses rational thinking when he explains the purpose of his many imaginative mechanism, which he takes the time to explain rather than leaving the reader confused.Dune is appealing because even though it is futuristic, it is based off of basic systems of society. The Political structure is based off of a feudalistic kingdom with rulers and subjects but instead of having countries to rule and fight over, Herbert has planets. Herbert chooses to have the main struggle between these kingdoms to be over a simple spice (with the bonus of cognitive properties), instead of some futuristic object. In this way Dune has a deep connection to medieval and basic human nature.The book though can be hard to follow because of its sudden rush into the world of reason and political warfare. Herbert relates these tensions by writing from the perspective of several characters, including the antagonist. Also the sudden jumps in time can be annoying because Herbert will suddenly skip ahead in the story because Paul has an insight on how things are going to turn out, and then that insight suddenly happens. This could leave the reader feeling gypped out of storyline.Overall this is a novel that everyone with a taste for imaginative and ingenious writing should read and appreciate as a classic that is the heart of modern science fiction."
305,1556909330,Dune,,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,Barry C. Chow,3/3,5.0,1001376000,A &quot;masterpiece&quot; deserving of the claim,"There is no praise that can be sung about this book that has not already been sung. When it was first published in 1965, it burst upon the science fiction scene like a supernova. Nothing had ever been written that was even remotely similar. Reviewers coined new phrases to describe the novel: &#65533;space feudalism&#65533;, &#65533;feudal-futurism&#65533;, even &#65533;sand fiction&#65533;. Yet, anyone who has read the novel can attest to the poverty of such labels. This is a book that defies pigeonholing.Where shall I start? Firstly, unlike so much in science fiction, even by grand masters like Asimov and Clarke, this book develops characters of exceptional depth. They each have such vibrant inner lives that it is impossible not to identify with them. The writing is absolutely first class. Spare, tight, exquisitely metaphorical, not a word wasted, it&#65533;s a pleasure to read. The imagery is so effective you can feel the grit of sand in your teeth. Then there is the sheer genius of Herbert&#65533;s imagination. He borrows from history the religious and feudal societies, but transform them into something unique and original.This is one of the most complete science fiction classics ever written. Whether it is writing skill, plot, themes, setting, characterizations, breadth of imagination or sheer weight of ingenuity, it beggars parallel. I can&#65533;t think of a single fault, except perhaps that it had to come to an end.The only unfortunate aspect of this work was that it scaled pinnacles of such extraordinary height that Herbert would never attain them again. Each of his sequels fell further and further from the mark set by this novel, and some of his later works were simply embarrassing.Beg, borrow or steal this book. Just don&#65533;t pass up the chance to read it."
306,1556909330,Dune,,,,0/0,5.0,922838400,Absolutely the most breathtaking sci fi tale ever written,"Herbert is like a prophet, he seems to have the same vision of the future that I do, the battles will keep you reading hours into the night, and the storyline seems to keep on rolling, and rolling, and rolling, never a stop in the excitement. The story begns on Caladan- the homeworld of House Atreides, The house is being &quot;relocated&quot; so to speak, to the desert planet Arrakis, otherwise known as Dune. The previous rulers there were the Atreides sworn enemy- The Harkonnens, when the atreides move in to take over, everything goes okay, for a while, then the Harkonnen treachery kicks in, and the Atreides duke is killed, the title falls on his son- Paul, yet he was thrown into the desert to die. The natives, known as the fremen, capture him then realize that he is the Lisan al Gaib, the voice from the outer world, a figure that their religion is based upon, Paul trains the Fremen in the way of battle that he had been taught his whole life. They become his army, and together, they take Dune back from the Harkonnens. If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would, READ IT!!!!!"

It started off well, but it seemed like the last part of the book was rushed with the author jumping over large periods of time. I also had difficulty finding any characters that I could really like.

310,1556909330,Dune,,A1P8DIBAXF6H37,Kurt Conner,1/1,4.0,1274140800,Detailed and epic and beautiful and thought-provoking,"I read this book twenty years ago and bought it again to try to remember if I had liked it or not. I may not have appreciated it then, but I really enjoyed it this time. The story is an epic one, set on an intricately-designed desert planet with a variety of cultures and individuals scheming for political power. At the heart is a tale of a reluctant messianic figure who experiences tragedy and tries to find a way to rise again that will not cause his followers to doom the universe. Herbert plays up the epic nature well, by starting each new section with a quote from some fictional chronicle of these events. The effect does take out all tension of whether or not Paul (the messianic figure) will live or die, but the benefit of knowing that these events are Historical and Significant far outweighs the lack of tension.I imagine that the frequent references to jihad will offend many modern readers, as will the mingling of quotations from the Torah and the Koran without any reference to a supernatural God (in fact, I have been surprised to see this book described as a religious work, since there are numerous ceremonies and scriptures but no real concept of a supernatural force of any kind, and the salvation that Paul is expected to bring is an ecological and philosophical one). I also think the ecological significance of this book has changed a bit since its 1965 publication (I don't know that many environmentalists today are looking to convert deserts into rainforests, although the end of the book does point to a certain restraint and respect for systems that soften the thrust a bit).For me, though, the best part of the book is the way that some of the characters are gifted at translating conversations and reading body language. There is a particularly good scene at a dinner party when no one really means what he says, and the more astute characters observe and tell the reader what each exchange really means. It changed the way I listened to group conversations for a while, honestly, and made me think a lot about the layers of meaning I hide in my own speech. I have no plans to finish this series, as I'm quite satisfied with the state of things as Herbert left them at the end of this book, but I recommend this to anyone interested in science fiction and fantasy, especially those looking for something to compare favorably with the Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time classics."

DUNE is the first book in a trilogy a book for readers at about 12 years old and up because it is very complex. An example of how complex it is that there is a dictionary of the unusal or madeup words.DUNE is a little bit like STAR WARS, if you like STAR WARS, you would like DUNE. It is set in the future. Bene Gesserits are a little like Jedi Knights except they are all female. What happens in DUNE is that the Atreids, people from a planet with a normal amount of water (Caladan), come to a planet with almost no water (Arrakis/Dune). The main setting is on Arrakis. Arrakis is a planet that is all a desert where water is used instead of water. The Atreides came to defeat the Harkonnens, they have been fighting for a long time. The Fremen are native to Arrakis. Water is a treasure to the Fremen so precious that when a person dies they squeeze the water from his skin.The main character is Paul. He is a very complex character because he changes completely. During most of the book he is smart but at the end he gets smarter than his Bene Gesserit mother. An example is that he can se many ways that he could change the future. Jessica is Paul's mother. She is a very loving and compassionate person, but when she needs to fight she will. She is very logical and intelligent. Paul's mother is a Bene Gesserit. There is only one Kwisatz Haderach (A male Bene Gesserit) that could do things no Bene Gesserit can. Could that be Paul? Bene Gesserits have the power to use the voice a way to tell people what to do and they do it without thinking they are under the Bene Gesserit's power."

He was very clever. As Yueh, Gurney and a human-computer Mentat code named Eyebrowz approached the room, Paul quickly hit Alt-F4 to close his connection to www.babes4all.com. Behind the now closed window were still photographs of Worms from Dune.The trio came into the room, but Paul, with his back turned to the door, did not look back. Yueh was thinking about saying, with a very irritated voice: &quot;Paul. How many times have I told you, don't sit with your back facing the door. It's impolite.&quot; - but before he could speak, Paul yelled: &quot;I heard You, You and You. All three of you, my friends, walk into the room.&quot;. &quot;Our sounds and smells can be immitated!&quot; raged Eyebrowz. &quot;I'd know the difference.&quot;Yes, Paul would know the difference. For Paul was the first and only son of Jessica, the Bene Gesserit witch that married Duke Leto Atreides of House Caladan. For 90 generations, the Bene Gesserit had been manipulating bloodlines of many great Houses, so that they can eventually produce the Universe's Super Being, the Kwisatz Haderach. The Kwisatz Haderach was supposed to be born in Generation 91. But the Bene Gesserit wanted Paul to be a woman, but he wasn't. Otherwise he would be visiting hotmen.com and not babes4all.com. Thats how the Bene Gesserit found out, after checking Paul's log files. So Paul knew the difference because he was the Kwisatz Haderach, the Universe's Super Being.Meanwhile, back in his laboratory on Geidi Prime, Piter De Vries, Master Mentat and Assasin King for House Harkonnen, was working on his Juice of Saphoo recipe.Read the book for the real story."

This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens afterChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)).Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.If you liked the books, I highly recommendFrank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)- it's a pretty good film adaptation ofDune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)andChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)."

Science fiction always seems to rely on the human factor. The struggles that we deal with today. The dirty politics. The writer can only write what he knows, that's what makes this genre so compelling and yet so frustrating for the writer. And at times the audience can translate that frustration. It is this that punctuates his core characters. I could feel the struggles he took in deciding things for his characters. I fought with his characters with great apathy. I felt fatigued at one point, At midsection through the book, when poor Paul is left with his mother. Estranged, driven out of their proud house. I wanted to believe that only good would come for the young boy and his mother. Frank makes good use of his genius and technical sources. He made a world, a world of fabulous riches and depth, real. This is the hardest single achievement for writers. Shakespeare created a world where you could imagine anything occuring. Tolkien created, gave birth to a cultural sense for his beloved LOTR's. Frank takes us to a desert planet, on the shoulders of a royal family. A duke, and his mistress, whom he shares love with, and with Paul whom belongs to a rare school of teachings, in which he is the only male. A living legend it is told, and great turmoil, mixed with hope. Paul, as a young boy, is faced with this legend. You are tossed into his mind for instances. You read in soliquy. His thoughts are aged and his coherence is quick. Every step of his realization, do you follow. Every love, and then the betrayel. You follow it all, and inside this young boys head, you hear the unnerving duty that calls him. His attraction to the spice. His inherited understanding of the world of Arrakis. The mysterious spice. It is the power of Arrakis, and the understanding of the spice is his destiny. I am proud to have read this book.-jeff"

Although the book was in times very confusing to me mainly because of all of the new words and things that Herbert created. I did though like the story and enjoyed reading the book. I got attached to many characters but mostly enjoyed reading about Paul; the main character, which is expected, but I also loathed more than I liked. I thought that the bad guy Baron Harkonnen was a very evil, somewhat pathetic man in some ways but I also did not like some of the good characters. I did not like Paul's mother Jessica mainly because I disliked the Bene Gesserit who are a group of women that think that they control everything. When I read a book I do not like certain people or groups of people that try to control everything. Even with these things that bother me I thought that the book was very entertaining and well written. How Frank Herbert thought of this incredible world amazes me. He created many characters with different personalities and goals. The world of Dune is very well thought up and I got a very clear picture of it, going beyond seeing a giant desert. The fact that Herbert can think of a series of planets that have very detailed descriptions, and then create a whole new civilization on each one, especially one as complex as the Fremen, is incredible. The others are made to seem as a futuristic us, but the Fremen are completely different. They are what we would become if we were trapped in the desert, and I think they are really cool. Since most events in this novel are somewhat difficult to comprehend, I would say this is not a book for children under thirteen. For everyone else who has an imagination and enjoys reading a good science fiction, I would definitely recommend this book, it was one of the better books I have read."

IF one happens to agree with, or is persuaded in the process by Herbert's arguments, swayed to his weltanschauung so to speak, then the plot and the characters are VERY adequate, being intensely allegorical yet realistic, in a fractal-like relationship, in which the individual microcosm is reiterated to ever larger encompassing structures/universes. If you don't think the universe is funny, if you don't buy into poetic justice and the noble savage fairy tales, if your view of the world is realistic - as in positivistic, scientific and pragmatic - then your reaction to Dune is bound to be different and the author's literary craftsmanship (or lack thereof) will have nothing to do with it.As far as his writing skill is concerned, many seem to find his omniscient, character shifting third person lacking, in that it prevents one from empathizing with one character or another. I find it brilliant and a delightful tour-de-force, with so many points of view in the same scene and each character a mirror to the others.This book is not for Star Trek fans. It is not uplifting, it does not speak of the glory of Man, it is not about exploration, it does not serve any system's propaganda. On the contrary, it is anti-establishment in a broad sense and anti-democratic to the extreme... On second thought, it should be banned! :) Burn it! :)))"

Those who found the original masterpiece enthralling will find this work just a little less engaging. The freshness of ideas, together with some plausibility is lost - as it is in any sequel. We are, perhaps, a little to well prepared by the time we have finished the first book, to appreciate this one. And some creations, spring out - not naturally, but almost in an ad hoc manner, making whatever surprise they were meant to offer, look incredulous instead.Dune Messiah is not badly written. But because the light of its predecessor was so bright, it appears somewhat paler, by comparison. It is apparent, even to the casual reader that this book has far more subdued overtones. And perhaps, just barely, the hint of trying to stick to a formula.However, the saga of Dune itself is far from over. And to appreciate the latter books in this series, of which Dune Messiah is an integral part, no serious fan should skip reading this. It will be evident, much further down the road, of how some seemingly random creations fit into the overall scheme of things.No one has been able to lay down such controversial ideas - should I even call them Heretical? - into a more digestible form, than Frank Herbert. Unfortunately Dune Messiah makes is just a bit too easy in the digestion, and just a tad too close to orthodoxy!Perhaps, my review is not entirely free from personal bias. In Dune, Frank Herbert created a hero that I grew to love. In this book, I am forced to watch his career and life ebb slowly away. (This book is aptly named! A messiah cannot escape his personal doom.)All in all, it is still an astounding piece of fiction. Read it. But don't stop here. Go on to the next book. And the next! Profound ideas will arise yet again - when you meet The God Emperor!"

328,1556909330,Dune,,AAG231B9RSSIN,Darby,4/6,5.0,1187481600,A classic of high-brow SciFi,"[Review written in Dec 2004]It's credentials say it all ... winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards, and widely acclaimed as one of the crowning masterpieces of Science Fiction.Before I begin, the first thing that people need to do is to ignore the exceedingly mediocre and disappointing theatrical movie. The made-for-TV mini-series by the SciFi Channel was marginally better, but still fell well short of the quality and depth of the original books. Readers also need to completely forget (and avoid) the highly mediocre `fluff' offering by Brian Herbert, who is apparently trying to ride to success on the coat tails of his departed father.That having been said, the Dune Saga (referring to the series as a whole) tells the tale of how an intergalactic empire, stuck for countless centuries in a rut of social and technological stagnation, suddenly reaches a political, military, economic and religious ""tipping point"" ... and then suddenly slides headlong into war & chaos, as military alliances, political powers, economic cartels, and secret societies/orders all begin vying desperately for control over the most precious substance in the known universe: The Spice Melange (which extends life, expands consciousness, and makes interstellar travel possible).It's a tremendously complex and sweeping story, pulled off in elegant fashion by a grandmaster writer ... and the amazing thing is that it can be read on so many different levels, and that it touches on so many different branches of academic interest - cult dynamics & religious engineering, philosophy, ecology, eugenics & selective breeding, medical ethics, super intelligence & racial memory, etc ad infinitum.This is not a series to be attempted lightly by casual SciFi day trippers ... this is fairly toothsome, polymathic and intellectually challenging series that lays the burden of keeping up with the sweeping social avalanche(s) underway squarely in the lap of the reader. If you prefer your scifi lite and not too challenging, then you're probably better off avoiding this series, because you won't be happy.Highly recommended - for high brow readers."

To paraphrase the great Arthur Clarke, ""nothing compares to it except THE LORD OF THE RINGS."" While the series eventually peters out toward the end of the six book cycle, the first three are masterpieces and the original is a classic. Where else will you find a great feminist religious conspiracy, giant ""sandworms"" or fanatical desert tribal warriors? And then there are the heroes (Atreides), the villains (Harkonnen scum) and a vast dramatis personae that no novel (SF or otherwise) can match (save, of course, LOTR). Why settle for later and lesser ripoffs? Want to know where George Lucas got ""Tatooine?"" And learn how religious dogma and messianism can raise up and then throw down a great desert people. Did I mention there are GIANT SANDWORMS -?? If you only read one SF novel, read this one. If you want to become a fanatical follower of a fictional universe and can't stand elves, this is the book for you! Highest possible recommendation."

But, I will construct some pros and cons (from what I remember reading it only once, so far).Pros:1) Complex political world that spawned many other writers of today (Robert Jordan, for one)2) Imagination before his time : the CHOAM institute, the self-sustaining spacesuits etc.3) As someone referred to: the JEdi-like powers of the Mentats and Bene Gesserits. However, people forget, that Herbert wrote this book BEFORE Lucas' Star Wars world erupted.4) the in-depth cultures, I wanted to know more about them.5) the beautifully written sceneries, albiet sometimes too short.6) the usages of his characters' powers are nicely done.Cons:1) The characters are not as fleshed out as they can be, but this is NOT a character world. It's a plot/political and scenery novel.2) the battle action scenes were not as well described as I liked.3) the powers of the characters were too quickly developed. One day, Paul was a normal guy, and then he became a Prophet? Without background to this? Hello? No description of his dreams? His actual events that took him to become the Prophet?Overall though, Dune's prose is excellent, story telling is superb and it's a highly creative piece of work. Not a masterpiece, but close to it."

A little boring at times. Honestly, I can only agree to 1 and 3. I don't think it is in the class of the Lord of the Rings, but it is certainly noteworthy science fiction if you can slog through some of the more longwinded passages. Herbert's GRAMMAR skills are in question at certain points. Finally, except for it's small cult fan base, no one talks about this book....at all. No one buys Dune calendars, plays Dune games, etc. Thus, the emotional bond that Tolkien established in the Lord of the Rings is obviously absent here. Tolkien influenced generations with his story, and clearly Herbert has not."

I went to the theatres to see the Dune movie. I got addicted to computer gaming after playing the Dune strategy games; so I had to read the book 30 plus years later. I definitely got more out of this book the second go around. 30 years of experience also helped. Mine is the hard copy version. It has a durable book cover and the color of the hard cover is white with black binder strip. In terms of the quality of the book material, the hard cover and paper are average. Nothing of the quality of what can be acquired for any of JRR Tolkien's LOR, Silmarillian and The Hobbit books. In terms of the content, still not as good as LOR but still brilliant. I don't consider this book purely a SCI FI book. The fusion of religion and spiritually in my opinion puts the SCI FI aspect of this book as secondary. While the politics in this story are simplified, the work is a most enjoyable and rewarding experience. Much of what I remembered from the first read was false; maybe due to the movie and computer games. I don't typically reread books. But was glad I did. This look into our probable future is a good example of how we ""could"" change our perception of the ""dream"". The story is timeless."

I do not recommend this book if you are look for a light, easy time waster, a book just to relax. Dune is a book that requires not just your full attention, but your full mind.Set on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune), a fifteen year boy boy named Paul, accompanies his father, a duke, to the new world to supervise the cultivating of the addictive spice Melange.This is an extremely brief summary of the incredibly complex book and plot.One of the things that impressed me most about Dune was the world building. Everything works to make this world, nothing is added just for the sake of feeling 'exotic' or 'cool'. Everything works together in order to make this world seem so whole and unto itself. One thing about Sci-fi is that it can easily be dated by advances in technology, but Dune does not feel dated. I feel it could have been easily written today in the same form. That is how good the world building is. I cannot recall being pulled out of it for a moment.I think i large part of it is the focus of politics and philosophy also keep it from being dated. Since so much of it revenant to us, especially the commentary on the interplay of religion and politics. Some of the quotes and lined made me pause and just think about them and their place in the contemporary world. The only other author that has ever made me do that is Orwell.If you are looking for a book that can be considered 'brain food' and challenging to you, then pick up a copy."

Frank Herbert often presents an event and then &quot;listens in&quot; on the thoughts of those present. This could have made it seem tedious. But Herbert pulls it off inspiring rapt attention. This plethora of viewpoints is one of the strong points of the novel.This book includes many themes including: Fate, Duty, Honor, Despotism, Suffering/Hardship and its effect, Addiction, Sexual descrimination, Autocratsy vs Democracy, Power, Religious Ferver, Genetic Engineering and others.This book is a MUST READ!"

The Dune Chronicals is by far one of the most compelling pieces of writting in modern literature and is science-fiction's answer J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'. Dune is a grand story and should never be without the rest of the Dune Trilogy that ties it's concept together.

I didn't understand it. I was bored by it. I decided all the hype around it was undeserved, and I cast it off.The more fool, me. This is without doubt the best sci-fi book ever written, and perhaps the best book, period. It's changed the way I look at everything. When I was 17, I just decided to pick it up again for no reason--and I was in love. I've never been the same since. Paul, Jessica, Stilgar, Alia, even old Baron Harkonnen--the characters all found their way into my mind and heart. DUNE is a novel of incredible scope and power, ranging from musings on ecological themes to an exploration of the messianic desire that has always pervaded society. The time Herbert must have invested to research and create such a detailed universe took my breath away. I was riveted from the Introduction all the way through the Appendices. I'm still finishing the rest of the series, and while none of the other books have left the same impression on me, they are excellent books--especially CHILDREN OF DUNE.

The science and logic is dubious at best (memories passed down through genes, the premise that living in a desert makes people into invincible warriors), etc. As a book of epic battle it is mixed, with the first half done in wonderful detail, but with the climax simply glossed over, the hero's victory seemingly inevitable making description unimportant (or so it seemed to me). The book is poorly paced, to say the least. But what makes Dune a decent book afterall are the characters. The characters are beautifully drawn out, each with their own motivations so that friends are drawn into conflict and enemies drawn together. Dune is by far the best in the series, the other books lacking any real tension, since the protagonist's victory is all but assured from the first page. In Dune, the final outcome is uncertain up until the last moment, and even then there are plenty of unresolved plot lines that leave room for a wonderful (but unrealized) sequel."

They suffer and we suffer; they succeed and we are irrepressibly happy. It is a well-written novel with an engaging plot. Above all, however, the book addresses universally applicable themes and profound concepts. It is this fact that allows Dune to transcend to a higher plane than the average science-fiction novel.The only negative aspect I found with this book is that, upon finishing it, I was terrified to experience anything else, any of its other forms. The sequels(Dune Messiah, House Harkonnen, etc.) and the movie stood no chance at all in matching this masterpiece.

Paul Atreides was born to Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor Shaddim IV. For his first fifteen years, Paul lived on Caladan, the Atreides home planet. Then the Emperor exchanged Arrakis -- Dune -- for Caladan.In this novel, Duke Leto is a leader of men and sees Arrakis as an opportunity to expose the former possessors -- the Harkonnens -- as incompetents. Arrakis is the only planet that produces Melange, popularly known as Spice. The substance allows Guild Navigators to guide ships between the stars and extends the life of any who can afford it.Duke Leto also sees a great opportunity in the Fremen, the dwellers of the Arrakis desert. The Harkonnens have hunted the Fremen for sport and consider them to be native trash. But the Duke knows that the Fremen are potentially as deadly as the most elite force within the Empire, the Sardaukar.The Duke and his retainers are preparing for the move. Yet Paul is being prepared for something else. Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam has come to Caladan to test him with the gom jabbar.The Bene Gesserit have been breeding for a Kwisatz Haderach, a person with unusual talents and a strange destiny. The first step in testing for such a person is the gom jabbar, the test of pain. When Paul inserts his hand into the box, he fells as if his hand is being burned to a blackened stump.His mother Jessica knows that he will be subjected to extreme pain, but she doesn't question the need. She has been trained by the Bene Gesserit and accepts their goals. Yet she was ordered to produce a girl child and she is not quite certain why she had disobeyed.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sees the turnover of Arrakis as an opportunity to destroy Duke Leto. He and Piter -- his Mentat -- brief his nephew Feyd-Rautha on the plan. But the Baron and his Mentat can't converse without bickering. Feyd-Rautha would rather be elsewhere than to witness their quarreling.Wellington Yueh is a Suk Doctor in the household of Duke Leto. The Baron Harkonnen has captured His wife Wanda and is pressing the doctor to kidnap Paul. The doctor has convenient access to Paul and is trusted by the Atreides.In this story, the Atreides take their household and possessions to Arrakis on a Guild freighter. Rather than occupying Carthage -- the former Harkonnen capitol -- the Atreides land in Arrakeen, which Thufir Hawat -- the Duke's Mentat -- has decided is more defensible. The Atreides family resides in the household of Count Hasimir Fenring.The Atreides contact the Fremen and learn of a Harkonnen force disguised as Fremen. Duncan Idaho and his men take the Harkonnens captive, but the Harkonnens severely wound the Fremen courier. He dies in transit to the Atreides medical facility.Stilgar -- chief of a Fremen sietch -- comes to Leto to evaluate him. He honors Leto enough to give him permission to unsheath a crysknife found near the courier. Duke Leto then gives Duncan Idaho leave to return to the sietch with Stilgar.This story tells of the death of Duke Leto and the transfer of loyalty of his men to Paul. It takes Paul to the Fremen and makes him one of them. It lays the foundations of the fall of the Empire and the rise of the God-King.This novel is only the first of a great series. It creates a very fascinating universe that is still being read and expanded. It may be the best of the author's works, if only for its great scope and backstory.Highly recommended for Herbert fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exotic societies, political intrigue and strange powers.-Arthur W.

While the Lord of the Rings trilogy stands out as the best fantasy novel, I view Dune as the best science fiction novel. I am an avid reader and when I find authors I love, I devour everything the write. The first Dune book is the best in the series, but I liked the first three books. I made the mistake of watching the movie Dune (the version with Sting in it) before reading the book, and I hated the movie, which caused me to avoid the book for several years. Finally, a friend of mine who had read the book strongly recommended I read it anyway and I broke down and picked up the book at a library. It drew me in so quickly, I bought it and have read it several times since. I love the intrigues between the royal houses, the devious manipulations and scheming (breeding programs, power, control of spice, Arrakis/Dune and space travel) which extends even to the planting of religious seeds into undeveloped civilizations so that a reverend mother would be recognized and embraced by these civilizations generations down the road. The political and religious themes are woven powerfully through the plot. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough."

I'm not sure what that says about the book overall but take it for what it's worth. I debated for a bit about whether I liked it or not. It was a good enough read, which is not exactly a thrilling testimonial. But it didn't make my pulse quicken with excitement.I thought the first third of the book was very good and it had me eager to read the remainder of the book. But after that, it was slow, methodical, and generally boring. I wasn't waking up every day looking forward to reading it. To me, that's the ultimate non-vote of confidence for a book. A book needs to be calling your name for it to be read. This one was not.In the science fiction genre, I think Assimov has a lot more interesting material out there. Even though this is considered a classic, I don't see it as worthy of such a lofty distinction. I think his aims at religion and philosophy were too grand for what he was capable of.I agree with some people who said the buildup to many scenes was anti-climatic. Many words were poured out for events that would go nowhere. And the events that did generate action were often times written as if the main character was taking out the laundry. There was no fire to many of the characters and scenes.I note 2 things about the Amazon listing of this book. The first is that it's been reviewed 814 times. The second is that it has an average rating of 4.5 stars. At the end of the day, my review isn't going to change many people's minds out there. But I feel obligated to write it anyway.Having said that, proceed as you will. This review isn't going to change many opinions and most will think I'm probably out to lunch with this review.

A mix of Star Wars and Foundation, perhaps, or a coming-of-age/hero tale, like the epic sagas of mythology and folklore. The Forces of Good fights (and conquers) Evil, everyone lives happily ever after..?Then, you may notice the setting. From the harsh desert world of Arrakis to the byzantine intrigues of the drug-embracing feudal Imperium, DUNE creates an environment unparalleled in SF.Next, free your mind from the heroic mystique, and put it to what actually happens to the characters. Do they live happily ever after? Do most of them live at all? DUNE becomes a tragedy; beautiful and sad and strange.And only then will you notice the things that don't seem to fit. Like why did Paul have drums made from the skin of his enemies? And why does Jessica refer to her saviours as 'peasants'. And what happens to the power? Above all, what happens to all that power!? And maybe you will see the philosophy and morality of DUNE. The wisdom of DUNE.Notice the language. The delicate use of contrast and surprises, allusions and understatements. The way Frank Herbert seems to toy with his readers, distracting us from the point on enjoyable side-trips. Notice the irony, how DUNE continually questions its own premises and concepts.And you will suddenly realize, that on top of all, against all probability, DUNE is incredibly, impossibly, hilariously FUNNY!Then read the sequels.

There is a feudalistic galactic empire with all the attendant political intrigues. There are numerous religious movements, some operating more scientifically, others quite mystically. And there is the subtle character of the planet Arrakis (or Dune) itself, whose hostile environment, precious spice resources and devastating sandworms make it not only the most important planet in the galaxy, but also arguably the most interesting planet in science fiction.There is too much here to detail in one review.

If I were to recommend someone (especially someone who doesn't read Science Fiction) a Science Fiction novel, Frank Herbert's Dune is what I would primarily recommend. Frank Herbert adds myriad, quite verbose and hard to read details to intensify the condition of this story. While these details may be considered unneeded to some people, without them many people would probably be reading Arabian Nights even though these two books are scarcely similar.Frank Herbert creates a nearly uninhabitable landscape for the moisture-lacking desert planet of Arrakis for the Atreides family including Paul, the main character, to live on. However, Arrakis was once inhabited by House Atreides' archenemy, House Harkonnen and is also currently inhabited by Arrakis natives called Fremen during the story. The Fremen are an intelligent race that do everything they can to survive on the planet which includes wearing special suits called stillsuits to preserve the ""body's water.""Adding yet another variable to the living conditions on Arrakis are the colossal sandworms; many are larger than whales. They reside under the sand and can hear movements on the sand's surface. They hunt down travelers and spice factories alike, completely consuming anything moving on the surface of the sand. Fremen have adapted to this way of life but people like the Atreides have much to learn.There are two things that are valuable on Arrakis. One is water and the other is m&eacute;lange spice. Spice is the only reason why people other than Fremen inhabit Arrakis. It is the major export and profit maker of Arrakis. It is addictive like a drug to and is prized among the wealthy outside Arrakis. Atreides make portable spice factories to mine this spice despite their high vulnerability to sandworms.15 year-old Paul Atreides has intelligence beyond perceptibility in this novel. He is the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, leader of the Great House Atreides. Much of his intelligence comes from special training, but it is easy to doubt this is where he gets all of his superhuman adeptness. He is burdened by a self-founded ""terrible purpose.""I really enjoyed this book. It isn't a book that I couldn't put down. It's too much of a mind-draining book to read it continuously for hours. I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book all at once. Dune gives you an idea of how good your present living situations are compared to the characters in this book. This is a book that I would have regretted not reading.Tyler H."

Fisher ""Raye""",3/3,5.0,1162252800,"""Fear is the Mind-Killer...""","I'll keep this review brief, as to be honest, I'm not sure that there's much to say that hasn't already been said (and said much more eloquently) by other reviewers. First published in the 1960s, Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" and its consequent sequels are the science-fiction equivalent to fantasy's ""The Lord of the Rings."" Dense, detailed and complicated, ""Dune"" cannot be read just once in order to fully appreciate the immense time and effort that went into its creation.Best (but over-simply) described as a story of political intrigue and power, ""Dune"" takes place predominantly on the planet Arrakis, where immense sandworms traverse the endless deserts and cultivate the substance known as spice, the most precious commodity in the universe. Governance of this planet has recently passed from the Harkonnen to the Atreides household, and Duke Leto Atreides and his family is preparing for the upheaval in their lives. His young son Paul, the product of the Duke and his beloved concubine Jessica, is greeted with particular interest on arrival in Arrakis, believed to be a subject of prophecy by the native Fremen people.But the Harkonnen household will not so easily give up their hold over Arrakis and the spice, and have taken measures to ensure the death of the new royal family. Thrown in amongst the fierce Fremen people, Paul creates a new identity for himself as messiah and ruler, the only one who can restore the planet to its rightful inhabitants. Of course, that's easier said than done and the effort takes place over a great number of years, filled with intrigue, betrayal, love, allies, enemies, war, marriage and political manoeuvring. It is intensely complicated, with many futuristic customs and ideologies that are never fully explained, effectively throwing the reader into a brand new world in which they must sink or swim. Many will find this exhilarating, others will be immensely confused, despite the presence of Appendixes and a Glossary of terms used.Herbert's great novel is unique because, despite the fact that it is science-fiction, it still has plenty of room for religious belief and practice, which in fact makes up the most intriguing part of the novel. The Bene Gesserit order was (for me) immensely fascinating, what with its elaborate scheming and genetic planning. Their unique fighting abilities, their prescience, their sheer calculated guile - it all makes for one of the most interesting and imaginative components of the story.The narrative is primarily centred on intrigue and movement as opposed to any descriptive passages on either character or setting, making it a rather difficult read at times. In fact, the narrative technique of the novel is utterly unique given that it is so intimate in detail despite the fact that the story is so epic in scope; you never get any `eye-of-God' passages, all events are strictly presented through the experiences of the character involved. A story that is told almost entirely through internal soliloquies and dialogue between characters - that's a rare thing, and it is a testimony to Herbert's skill that he got away with it. I must admit though, that at times I felt a little claustrophobic in terms of the intimacy of the writing. I know it is considered hubris by many to criticise such a work, but a little more ""breathing room"" amongst the density of the plot and ideologies would have been much appreciated.But in a way my complaints are irrelevant, as ""Dune"" should be read in any case.

This book is not just for Sci-Fi fans: It helps to understand how cultures come to differ, it is an epic (coming of age) story, and it blazes a trail for those who want to learn how far imagination can take you. This book immerses you into the venue of religion AND politics, leaving you with comparing our world at any time with the universe described in it's pages.

I've read many wonderful novels (2001, Stranger in a Strange Land, Foundation, Hyperion, Ender's Game, etc, etc.--classics all) that will stay with me for life, but none `wormed' its way in so deeply as ""Dune"". Herbert's masterpiece works on so many different levels, it would take another novel just to describe the depth.I won't lie to anyone, when I first picked up this novel many, many years ago and took a look at the dictionary, I began to wonder what I got myself into. This isn't a `light' read. However, Herbert hooked me on the first page and never let go. For me personally, this novel had everything a great classic should have, including stunningly rich, vibrant characters (something most sci-fi novels grievously lack). Granted, there are many that may not like this novel as much as I do, but I believe ""Dune"" is the standard by which all science fiction novels should be judged, and the goal all authors should try to attain--a quite daunting task, I might add.After many years (and a few failed attempts), ""Dune"" was made into a movie. Now I know that most people didn't like the movie (me included), but let's be fair. How does anyone make a successful movie of a novel that has so many intricate layers? While I thought the casting was first-rate and the costumes authentic, the task before them was monumental (and, alas, the special effects were `cheesy' at best). The movie tried desperately to be true to Herbert's vision, but it just cannot be done, and probably should never have been attempted.Between 1 and 10, ""Dune"" gets a solid 10. This is the only 10 I have given any novel, because no novel I have yet read matches the artistic depth and richness of Frank Herbert's ""Dune""."

It might be noted that the Dune books were originally planned to be a trilogy. This would have been the second book and ""Children of Dune"" would have been the conclusion. Some would say that it should have remained that way. However, regardless of how you read the books, I'd advise you DO read the original trilogy: ""Dune"", ""Dune Messiah"", and ""Children of Dune."" The latter-written Frank Hebert books are optional: ""God Emperor of Dune"", ""Heretics of Dune"", and ""Chapterhouse Dune"". These latter three books almost seem to tell a different story, set in the same universe in a much later time frame.OK, so ""Dune Messiah"" itself is a good book. However, it does seen to suffer slightly from ""second book of a trilogy"" syndrome. It picks up after the masterful conclusion of Dune, and it takes a while to get all the complex plots going again.

I don't read much SF, so I try to get to the Big Books (War of the Worlds, Ender's Game, Fahrenheit 451, &quot;The Year's Best&quot; anthologies, etc). This was not a good book. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, and everyone's always &quot;hissing&quot;, &quot;glaring&quot;, or &quot;swallowing with a dry throat&quot;. The plot is interesting enough, but not nearly as complex or Byzantine as I had expected: warring factions, religious fervor, double-crossing, nefarious rulers, ulterior motives - standard stuff, really. If anything, the plot seems complicated because we're told so little about what the Guild, the Great Houses, and CHOAM really are. Anyway, as a non-SF connoisseur I realize that I don't get to vote on which books are the classics. But from where I stand, DUNE is a poorly-written, lackluster, repetitive tale.

Capossere's review had some minor, almost-valid points, it couldn't be further from the truth. Of course, if you make your list of other authors and novels large enough, and you read into ""Eragon"" hard enough, you will be able to find examples of other works imbedded in ""Eragon"". However, these imbedded pieces are merely well-established facets of fantasy that Paolini abides by, just as Tolkien did decades ago, and authors have as well. ""Eragon"" is far from being full of predictable and boring plots, emotionless dialogue, and unrelenting clich&eacute;s. Having read all three of J.R.R Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" novels multiple times, I can honestly say I enjoyed ""Eragon"" much more. The story is written in an enjoyable style that doesn't require you to run for your dictionary every time an archaic word is uttered or bombastic language is unnecessarily used. It would seem that some of today's contemporary authors like to inflate their egos by injecting high-class vocabulary into their works when simpler terms would have sufficed; this is not so with Paolini's ""Eragon"". The story advances at a refreshing pace without lingering on any one aspect more then is necessary, and all key characters present in ""Eragon"" are properly fleshed out. Simply put, ""Eragon"" is a solid fantasy novel that deserves the praise it receives."

He finds a polished blue stone that attracts strange travelers. Then Eragon finds out that it isn't a stone, it is a dragon egg! The strange travelers are called the Ra'zac; they end up killing Eragons's uncle trying to find Eragon. After that, Eragon must go on a journey to find and hunt down the Ra'zac. Then Eragon finds an elf that was in a prison, but is unconscious, so Eragon must go to the varden but Murtagh ,the son of Marzan of the foresworn( riders who turned evil ) only slows Eragon down by saying that he won't go , and argues with Eragon. I recommend this to anyone who is into action and adventure.Courage, friendship, loyalty, and death are the main themes in this novel. Eragon shows courage Togo into the spine, even though few who went in ever came out, Eragon is also loyal to Brom. Eragon is Saphira, &Murtagh;'s friend. Then he shows courage to go after the Ra'zac. After Eragon finds Arya, the elf, he shows even more courage to change direction and go to the vaden. All of these themes make up a lot of the book.There are 4 main characters in this book, Eragon Brom, Saphira, and Murtagh. Eragon is the first character in the story. Saphira is the dragon that Eragon found in the Spine as a ""polished blue stone"". Brom is the one who trains Eragon. Murtagh is the on who saves Eagon and Brom from the Ra'zac. All these characters come together to fight against the empire.Eragon must go through the spine, Carvahall, Drasleona, and many other places. The spine is a mountain range that stretches from; Carvahall to Feinser. Carvahall is where Eragon lives before he went on the adventure of a lifetime. Drasleona holds Helgrind, ""the gates of death"". All of these places are inside of Alagaesia the total setting of Eragon.This book is for people who like adventure and warfare. Eragon is the main character. The novel Eragon is mostly about courage and loyalty. The setting for Eragon is in Alangesia. If you like adventure and warfare, then this is the book for you!

However, I am writing to warn other potential readers to beware of the flat characters, the thin storyline, and an extremely dry sequel (Eldest). After finishing this book, I though ""ok, its a little like lord of the rings with the elves, and dwarves but whatever."" What nags me the most is the unlikable and cliche main character. The farm boy who becomes super strong to save the world from evil. To me, its just stupid that the boy can become the savior of the land through a few weeks of hurried training by a wise ""story teller."" I feel like I would've like the book more if the author made the characters more realistic (Eragon struggling with his new role as savior and his struggle with learning magic, Elf-lady not so impossibly beautiful, and the rest of the characters worship the farmboy a little less).As for the second book, I couldn't finish it. It was boring, especially with the introduction of Eragon's cousin Roran.This could've been a good story, because it started out interesting. I would've liked the farmboy saving the world if only they would make the farmboy more human.I would only recommend this book to young adult readers because it is a simple read and kids should always be reading.Books > movies!"

And the author is fully deserving of the respect and admiration he gets--it is indeed an impressive book for a 17-year-old to have written. What he probably should not have gotten was a publishing contract, since while it is impressive for a 17-yr-old, it is less than impressive for a published work of fiction.If an adult had written and published this, I would have been disgusted (as I was with the Sword of Shannara) with the clear calculation that had gone into the work: ""ok, I'll take a lot of Tolkien, a lot of McCaffery, a good amount of Leguin, some Dragonlance, some Star Wars, etc. It will be a can't miss book."" Since it's the product not of an adult but of a teenager, it comes across much more positively--as a work of fiction by someone who has read lots and absorbed lots of fantasy and simply didn't have the experience (or the good editor) to take out all of his favorite parts of other works. How can I dislike or be too critical of someone who so obviously loved some of my own favorite authors, loved them so much that they simply took over his book through I'm guessing no fault of his own.And that in a nutshell is the problem with Eragon. The story is cliched, formulaic and barely passable as are the characters and the language is simply what you would expect from a somewhat precocious teen fan of adult fantasy. If you have any experience in the field of fantasy at all, reading Eragon will feel like a visit to Las Vegas (though not so tacky)--sure you can see New York and Paris and Italy, but they are mere shadows of the real thing. So McCaffery's telepathic link between dragon and rider is here, but not the powerful emotionality of her (especially earlier) works. LeGuin's idea of one true name and one true language forming the backbone of magic is here, but not her masterful sense of order and balance and restraint, not to mention the sparse beauty of her language. And of course, the graceful, bow-carrying elves, the gruff and secretive mentor with magical powers, the withdrawn dwarves, etc. all show up in their correct place and time. As a high school English teacher, the story and characters are exactly what I would expect to see if I picked up one of my fantasy fan's personal notebooks off of their desks and began reading. Even the people and place names are far too imitative (as opposed to inspired by). To be perfectly honest, it was so much like my students' writings I had to struggle to continue past the first ten pages.Does that mean nobody could enjoy this book? A quick look at the reviews clearly shows that many have (most of them young I'm sure). If you have read Tolkien, McCaffery, LeGuin, Jordan, Lewis, Pullman, Donaldson, etc., then I'd strongly suggest skipping Eragon. You'll not only be heavily disappointed by the weaknesses in plot, character development, and language, but you'll probably be annoyed at how often your favorite authors appear in borrowed and poorer clothing. If you have little experience in fantasy and so won't be bothered by the obviously derivative nature of this book, you'll probably enjoy it but there are far better works to begin a lifetime of fantasy reading with and even if you start with Eragon, I hope you quickly move onto them, beginning with the above list and adding for younger readers people like Lloyd Alexander, E. Nesbit, Robin McKinley, and many, many others. I'd like to see what this young author comes up with in another five-ten years, but for now he's still retelling the stories he liked himself, rather than writing down his own."

If you're looking for a fantasy book that has created a class of its own, Eragon would be the wrong place to look. It has many of the elements of fantasy that have already been used: dragons, elves, dwarfs, cities hidden in the woods and stone walls, etc. But by no means does that make it a bad book.

It's rare for me to remember much of a book after I'm done reading it, yet Eragon's storyline and characters get under your skin, and everything is so real.This book ranks with Tad William's Otherland series, Tolkien's Middle Earth, Jordan's Wheel of Time, Brooks Shannara, Eddings's Belgariad and Malloreon, Feist's Krondor and Magician.Buy it, steal it, rent it, borrow it.

Many argue that if a book can get kids to read than it can't be bad, but the truth of the matter is books like this should result in legal action rather than video game licensing and movie deals.I struggled to find a single original idea in this entire work, that's right there is not even one. What's worse is the presentation of the stolen ideas doesn't come close to the quality of the originals from which it steals.I agree with what others have said in that the biggest tragedy is that there are dozens of authors out there who have struggled to come up with original fantasy novels that have gone unnoticed by the masses. This is a sad exercise in the power of money when it comes to promotion. Let's face it, anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of the English language coupled with a near limitless parental budget and a head full of borrowed ideas should be able to duplicate this novel's efforts.Finally to everyone who insists that all fantasy is a rehash of prior concepts, I say simply this: Put down Eragon and read more fantasy. There are original works out there; if not entirely original races and settings, there are more original plots, less stereotypical characters, fewer literary clich&eacute;'s.Give Harry Potter a try, Artemis Fowl, Inkheart, The Uncommon Adventures of Tucker O'Doyle, Erec Rex: The Dragon's Eye, etc."

Thinking to sell or trade it to help his family through the harsh, northern winter, Eragon keeps the stone. Before he gets the chance to sell it, it hatches something thought to be extinct... a sapphire-blue dragon! Eragon develops a mental connection with the dragon, and when the murdering Ra'zac kill his uncle, he leaves his village only to find out that he is the first of the new generation of Dragon Riders. The Dragon Riders were the peacekeepers of Alagaesia Eragon is fated to be the one to turn the tide of the coming war to overthrow the cruel king, Galbatorix. Eragon and Saphira, his dragon, set out to find their way through the darkness, constantly growing in strength and knowledge.Though this novel is exceptionally interesting, it is sometimes hard to understand, but Christopher Paolini has already taken care of that. There are maps, glossaries, and definitions within the book to help you along the way. Eragon is definitely for fantasy readers, ages twelve and up.

Copying what one reviewer said, it is clear that he was 15 when he wrote this. Every page is full of cliches. I don't know if you have seen the entire starwars, but the basic plot for the first movie is exactly the same as Eragon (by the way, does that name remind you of anyone)Basic plot= A servant of an evil emperor attacks, with an army at his disposal, a convoy bearing an object of power to a rebellion against the Empire. The servant captures the convoy and its leader, but the leader (a princess, no less) sends the object away in hopes that it will fall into the hands of a wise old wizard, who is the last of his kind. The object is found by a poor farm boy, whose family (not parents but uncle) is killed as a result, leaving him nothing to stay behind for. He joins the wizard on a quest, as well as a rogue who has no love for the ""empire."" They save the princess, then the three flee to the rebels. This could be used to describe the first Star Wars movie, and no one would know the difference.Also, the names of many people and places copy Lord of the Rings.Arya - Arwen, ArdaArdwen - ArwenIsenstar - IsengardMithrim - Mithrim or mithrilEragon - AragornAngrenost - Angrenost, the Sindarin name for IsengardMorgothal - MorgothElessari - ElessarFurnost - FornostHadarac Desert - Harad DesertMelian - MelianVanir - ValinorEridor - EriadorImiladris - ImladrisUndin - Fundin/UdunAlso, Brom and Obi-Wan are almost exactly the same also. Think about it, old wise guy, the last of his kind, teaches a farm boy his tricks, swordplay, etc.Brom's sacrifice for Eragon also mirrors Obi-Wan's sacrifice for LukeEven in the second book Eldest, there are many similarities to the second Star Wars; the farm boy leaves the rebels after fighting a battle to train with an old hermit in the jungle ( Yoda in Star Wars, and the old dragon rider in Eragon) There the farm boy undergoes a life-changing experience, and later participates in another great battle to aid his friends when he sees a vision. He deuls a powerful enemy, only to be defeated, and then learns that that enemy is a family member and that one of the enemie's lord's main commander is his father (Vader, Morzan, Morzan, Vader)Overall, this is a truly great book, but that is to be expected when it is pretty much an exact copy of one of the world's most famous fiction stories.

However, this ""review"" is actually directed at all the ignorant people here that have the audacity to claim that Mr. Tolkien created Elves, Dwarves and Dragons. That claim couldn't be more incorrect and ridiculous. Elves and Dwarves are originally from Norse Mythology. And Dragons have been around for thousands of years!To assure myself of this, I did a little research and what I found was truly shocking. I have learned that Mr. Tolkien COPIED the names Gandalf (the protagonist of his epic story) and Middle-Earth (the setting of his world) from Norse Mythology. So in turn, anybody has the right to ""use"" Elves or Dwarves in their work as much as anybody else.I am not defending Mr. Paolini. I agree with the notion that he should develop his own material and refrain from further derivation of other fantasy novels. However, I do defend him in the sense that anybody can use Elves and Dwarves. Trust me he's not the only one. Below, I have provided two paragraphs which I cut and pasted from a Norse Mythology site which clearly states Mr. Tolkien took ideas from Norse Mythology and used it for his work.In conclusion you people really need to wake up and get a grip. Mr. Tolkien was great, but he's not the fantasy novel god here. People shouldn't be compared to him in everything regarding fantasy. My advice to you is just enjoy fantasy to its fullest. Have a nice day.Cut and Pasted Material Below:""Many people are familiar with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung, but they are not familiar with Norse mythology to which both of these works are heavily indebted.Tolkien was very well acquainted with Norse mythology, as can be seen by the use of it in his books. The name of one of his main characters, Gandalf, is found in The Poetic Edda. Gandalf is, in some ways, reminiscent of Odin, the leader of the Norse pantheon. Even the name Middle-earth, the setting for Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, comes from Norse mythology."" (...)"

I think the best praise I can give to it is that the world seems to have been created first and the story almost an after thought, because jsuta few chapters in and you find yourself almost another citizen. The Spine seems like a real place.This book was so good that I withdrew my usual stipulation of not reading a series book until the entire series is published.

I read Lord of the Rings, and was put to sleep by it. Boring, overly long, etc. Only the characters, use of archetypes and moral messages are anything to write home about with Tolkien. Other fantasy I've read is the same way: It follows all the traditional rules and comes off as dull reading, to me at least. So when I received Eragon as a gift I wasn't excited. Upon hearing that it was written by someone so young though, I was more interested.And from the first page I was loving this book. It's actually fun to read, as opposed to the more ""traditional"" books. Though it borrows from Tolkien, Star Wars, hell even the Matrix it seems, all that doesn't matter because it's an entertaining book full of grandeur and wonder. The Dungeons and Dragons playing, middle aged grizzled fantasy veteran reviewers here bashing the book for being written by a 17 year old need to lighten up and be entertained for once. I despise most fantasy novels because their goal isn't to entertain, and forgive me for reading because its fun but that's why I read. Sure Eragon isn't original, but guess what: It rocks. It was a page turner, and I'll be picking up book #2 no questions asked, day it comes out. It is NOT a children's book, don't know why it gets labled as one. Fantastic read, highly recommended.

Rather, he takes several popular characters from other sources and molds them to his needs. Likewise, the story lines of bad king versus good-but-outnumbered rebels, young innocent farm boy evolving into heroic warrior, etc. are hardly unknown to the science fiction genre but are nonetheless well handled by Paolini in creating a highly readable and entertaining story. While Paolini may not be a creator of totally new concepts, he certainly shows himself skilled at adaptation and improvisation, building a good read out of old materials.The reader will easily recognize many influences on the author as he created the novel Eragon. Anne McCaffrey's series of novels about the dragonriders of Pern are an obvious influence, but I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels have had even a greater influence than McCaffrey's works. Some parallels with J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories can be argued, and the ""Evil Empire"" against which the rebels struggle evokes images of the Star Wars motion pictures. Readers familiar with these various sources will quickly see Paolini's Brom as the counterpart of Tolkien's Gandolf. Paolini's Urgals are dead ringers for Tolkien's Orcs. The Elfin race goes by the same name in both Paolini and Tolkien. Paolini's two Ra'zacs remind one of Tolkien's nine Nazgul. The words that Eragon uses to lift stones and cast destruction on his enemies suggest the magic of Rowling's Harry Potter. And on and on go the parallels.Paolini's strength, however, lies not in the direct retelling of any of his source materials but in the adaptation of the sources' character types to his own ends. His novel is not a close variation of any of his sources' story lines but is his own creation. That the reader recognizes others' characters reborn in Paolini's work actually makes them even more endearing. Here are some of the old friends that we first met in other books reborn into a new environment and a different time. Their resurrection is pleasant and we are happy to see them in action once more.Unhappily, a very few grammatical errors found their way past both the author and his proofreaders. While these are but few, they still assault readers' sensibilities and leave behind a most unpleasant residue in their minds. In each instance, these involve the use of the first person objective case pronoun when use of the nominative case is appropriate. These would probably not be so jarring were overall usage elsewhere in the novel less excellent.In sum, I believe that those who have has enjoyed McCaffrey's dragonrider novels or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will also enjoy Paolini's Eragon. If one has read neither McCaffrey nor Tolkien but still enjoys an adventure fraught with peril, magic, a few monsters, and a sentient dragon, then I would still feel safe in recommending Paolini. On the other hand, if a reader seeks classical conflict, detailed character development, and the relief of an effective denouement at the end of it all, then he probably shouldn't be looking for a novel in the modern science fiction genre in the first place! I am anticipating Paolini's next novel in what he calls the Inheritance Triology with eagerness."

It belabors details ad-nauseam, such as what the characters did,ate,slept,walked almost every day of their journies.

When a girl in my grade reccomended this book to me I could tell it was going to be great. I got it a few days after the girl reccomended it to me and I couldn't put it down. I am also a big Harry Potter fan. I used to think that Harry Potter was the best series in the world.

Dragon riders once protected the land and ensured justice, but now, except for the evil King, the dragon riders are destroyed. The King's spies learn of the dragon's birth and destroy Eragon's uncle in an effort to find him and the dragon. If they can turn Eragon to the dark side, the King will be unstoppable. Fortunately, Eragon escapes and, with the help of an old bard, Eragon learns magic, swordfighting, and dragon tactics. Still, the King's power is too strong to confront alone.After a narrow escape, Eragon finds a beautiful elf-woman held captive by the King's shade. Together with a stranger who saves him, Eragon, the dragon, and the unconscious elf make their way to a rebel fortress deep in the dwarvish mountains. Yet the King has created evil alliances and his Urgal (Orc) subjects invade the Dwarf kingdom where all of Eragon's magic and power avail him little against the powerful shade.In the movie business, high-concept projects are frequently described as a combination of two well-known films. Eragon is definitely Starwars meets the Lord of the Rings. Set in a Middle-Earth world of elves, dwarves, orcs, and dragons, we have the familiar adventures of Luke Skywalker--the loss of his uncle, his aging warrior-bard teacher, the somewhat disreputable buddy, and the beautiful princess. Pretty good stuff.I'm torn in this review. On the one hand, it's an incredible feat for a fifteen-year-old author like Christopher Paolini to complete an entire novel, let alone an epic five-hundred pager. For the most part, Paolini's writing is competent, only occasionally drawing the reader out of the story. And the story is an exciting adventure as Eragon is thrown from adventure to adventure. On the other hand, Eragon doesn't really grow as a character. Sure he learns magic and swordfighting, but he's still the same whiny kid at the end of the story that he was at the beginning.Paolini is an author to watch. He's got talent and a fine sense of story. With a bit more experience in the world and some serious effort on character development, he may become a major author. ERAGON only hints at this promise, but it's a pleasant hint."
459,B000J521DU,"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.",,A3GM5NC4RVSQZN,Allison Ebert,2/2,4.0,1139961600,It's a fun read,"Yes, Christopher Paolini does seem to have taken a lot from well-known fanatasy authors (it seems to me that he must have read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series right before writing this book). Yes, he really likes to flaunt the fact that he knows a lot of big words, although he doesn't seem to know quite how to use them within the context of the story and to help the language flow nicely. And yes, the characters lack a lot of personality and development. However, all that aside, Eragon really is a fun book to read, as is its sequel, Eldest. As long as you're simply reading for enjoyment, these books are a great choice. Especially considering the fact that Paolini was 15 when he wrote it. Kudos to him for that alone, because no matter how much I complain about the things that bother me about his writing, he did actually write a novel (two, even), and get it published, which is something that I've yet to do. I think these books are also a good starting place for someone who hasn't read much fantasy because there isn't as much depth to it as Tolkien, Jordan, and the like.Whether or not it is entirely original material, Eragon is full of adventure and is very enjoyable light reading."

Baker,10/11,3.0,1123286400,Believe the good AND the bad,"Eragon the book is a textbook example of a tragedy: the very thing that makes it great, the hype, is its downfall. On the back cover there is a New York Times quote that refers to the book as ""An auhetntic work of great talent."" This book is neither authentic, nor of particularly great talent.Is Eragon an enjoyable book? Yes. I read it in about a week, and will admit I put off other things to finish it. That being said, it isn't nearly deserving of the praise it's received, and this has been the source of my frustration with it. Paolini's a decent writer FOR HIS AGE, but that doesn't make him a writer who was ready to be published. If Paolini's writing abilities where akin to his basketball skills, he would have gone on to play college ball; he wouldn't have graduated to the NBA. And these weaknesses really come through in the book. Ultimately, Eragon reads like 500 pages of well-composed Internet fan fiction.First, it's most predictable fault: it is, as so many before me have asserted, largely a story of Star Wars meets Pern set in Middle-Earth. This, of course, is the first classic pitfall of a young author. That being said, once you accept the paradigm, Paolini does a very good job of immersing you in this parroted world he has fashioned, and it's a fun world to be immersed in.Paolini makes some writing mistakes that just aren't acceptable, however. For example, in one rather drawn-out and pooly written scene, Eragon chastizes his friend Murtagh for slaying an enemy in lieu of showing mercy. Yet later in the book before a big battle, Paolini writes that Eragon was glad Murtagh was fighting beside him PRECISELY BECAUSE Murtagh is a merciless fighter! Either mercy is good, Chris, or it ain't; you have to pick one.In addition, he makes his main character both excessively powerful and at the same time excessively weak. Halfway through the book Eragon is declared to be the greatest swordfighter Brom (the Obi-wan character) has ever met. This sentiment is confirmed by later characters, including Murtagh, who apparently has been sword-training all his life. That's right; Eragon goes from being a farmboy to a blademaster in a mere 250 pages. Who woulda thunk it'd be so easy? At the same time, Eragon gets captured TWICE, and can't seem to take on a single opponent without fainting.Paolini's real weaknesses as a writer, however, emerge whenever he tries to achieve the so-called ""lyrical beauty"" he asserts to aspire. On his website Paolini states, ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf."" Tolkien was a professor at Oxford and Heaney won the Nobel prize. Home-schooled Christopher Paolini doesn't come close to reaching either, and he shouldn't even compare himself with them.For example, at one point he gives a description of the Sea, referring to it as as ""emotion incarnate"" and some such. This might have been a good passage, except it doesn't feel genuine. The passage doesn't read like Paolini truly BELIEVES the Sea is emotion incarnate; it reads like he flipped through Tolkien, read his descriptions of the Sea, and tried to imitate them. Ultimately, it makes for unconvincing writing.This problem similarly emerges whenever Paolini attempts to show Eragon's doubts. There are several passages throughout the book where Eragon wonders ""what kind of god could allow such horrible things to happen,"" etc. Theoretically, these scenes would help develop Eragon as a character and elevate his adventure from being merely a good story to a good book.However, these scenes involve only one or two sentences before Eragon gets on with his life in the next paragraph. For the reader to genuinely feel Eragon's confusion and frustration, more exploration and depth into that confusion is required. As it currently stands, the passages are too shallow to be believable. Paolini currently lacks the emotional depth as a writer, and perhaps even as a person (the pitfall of many young writers, who stereotypically ""have nothing to say""), to really carry these scenes.All that being said, Eragon is a good read, and definitely worth the buy. Just go in expecting to be disappointed with Paolini as a writer at several points."

Young adult readers between fifteen and seventeen should thoroughly enjoy reading this book, although parents should be cautioned that at times the content of this novel occasionally leans towards violence and the grotesque, such as when the author describes a baby mounted on a spear over a pile of slaughtered villagers.The seasoned reader will find that this novel is too simple, overly formulaic and rather predictable in that it follows the same plot and themes to a greater or lesser extent as the Star Wars series. In other words, although the author has yet to confirm some of the details, the reader has been given enough information to deduce these similarities:A young farm boy raised by his (aunt and) uncle because his mother wished to hide him from his father, an evil fallen knight, accidentally receives a package stolen from the empire which leads to the death of his uncle, the destruction of his home, and a hasty flight from all that he knows and loves. The farm boy soon discovers and accepts a mentor who is more than he seems.This mentor, who was once a great knight, gives him his father's magic sword, and after introducing him to the ways of the old knighthood, willingly dies at the hands of the empire's servants to save the farm boy. This leads to the introduction through chance of a long lost, still unrealized, sibling who like Eragon / Luke is a child of a fallen hated knight. Their father, like Vader, also betrayed and helped hunt down his fellow knights.The similarities continue down to smaller details such as helping the princess escape, the evil fallen knights sword being red, a hatred of slavery, a terrible battle where our hero saves the rebellion by performing a nearly impossible task in combat shortly after finding the rebel's hidden base, and finally a magic summons to a new master who will complete Eragon's training as a knight.Paolini will have a difficult task if he decides to break from this mould now that it is set, in that doing so he will create fractures and inconsistencies between books and will leave the readers of his works frustrated at the irrelevant information that they had previously been given. In order to remain Gricianly cooperative (see Grice's Maxims), Paolini is stuck with the plot and details listed above until they are revealed or fulfilled.In short, this book has a difficult time fitting into a safe age category. It is too violent for younger children, but too predictable for a seasoned audience. If you or your older children have to read something, and have read everything else, you may want to consider this book. It certainly isn't worse than Shadow Puppets by Orson Scott Card or the endless go-nowhere Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan."

The only goblin I want to hear about is during the love interest and that's only if its critical to the plot! So I have had to generate some rules to filter prospective reads. These are:-a) Never read a fictional book that has a map at the start that features place names ending in ""or"" or with names such as ""the enchanted forest"", ""the mountains of doom"" ""the desert of almost certain death"".b) Never read one where the protagonist has a name with a ""Z"" or an ""X"" in it, or ends ""or"" unless it's Trevor. Or Ivor.c) Features dialog on the first page that sounds something like ""Prince Zandor drove his gasping steed the last furlongs up the hill to castle Gardornack. He had ridden hard for 3 days since the Battle of the Kongor Hellpots had been lost of the Death Legion of Pooglplop rode unchecked through the Kingdom of Xantac"". Or indeed the classic theme,"" By the 12 Gods of Zonkotax, I will be avenged!!!""And of course Eragon features lashings of all of the above with jam on, and little cakes around the side. The language of the book is clumsy and it indeed reads like an adolescent fantasy of some young type who really wanted to have a girl-friend and be a big hero and all of that, but he didn't get out much because he was shy and had never seen a girls boobies, so he wrote what might happened if you could order a dragon over the internet and use it to push those big bullies about at school that made fun of him being a virgin etc etc.And what happened? He took his destiny in his own hands and wrote what is still a pretty impressive book, with a complex enough plot, reasonably rounded characters and an impressive scope. Now he can probably buy a dragon, and lives in a castle with The Sugarbabes or something and has more money than I can ever dream of. Fair play to the lad.When I was 15, I could hardly finish a 2-page essay because I was too busy having girlfriends, being good at sport and bullying that little nerd down the road who kept going on about goblins and dragons and stuff.If I had a fraction of this lads stamina, my conceptual proto-novels, ""Dave Jesus Investigates"" would have turned into a multi-million selling franchise, with a film and everything. Think of it, The Second Coming in 1987 San-Francisco, with Our Lord walking the earth in the guise of a private investigator, ""Dave Jesus"", who solves cases using his otherworldly miracle power, much to the amazement of his hard-bitten side kick Stan Legions who had lost his faith after his wife and family had been killed in a tragic church collapse. I suppose I could have added a dragon or two on retrospect...Anyway. The lad has written a book, that isn't particularly original, but it is better written than many, if not most, and was readable enough for me to read the second one as well, and the missus has the last one which I will no doubt read when I have finished my grown up books. So well done Christopher, gold star and top of the class!Edit - Oh No, ""Dave Jesus Investigates has just been optioned by Kevin Coster, oh crap!"

I thought (and still do) it was a great book. However, all through reading the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how familiar the whole book was. Then during the whole Star Wars mania, I ended up watching the original 3 Star Wars movies and there was my answer. Eragon is pretty much just a midieval retelling of Star Wars. Same plot, identical characters, just different names. The worst part is that Christopher Paolini doesn't even site that he used Star Wars' plot! He mentions he based things on Lord of the Rings, but no Star Wars! I was very disappointed when I discovered this. As most people have already stated, Eragon was CLEARLY written by a teenager.

However, I liken his effort to all of those romance novels that are written by bored housewives --- it is very nice that the initiative is there, but it is nothing we have not seen a thousand times before.Only the most dense reader could fail to see the obvious imitations of Tolkein strewn liberally throughout the work. Paolini may someday develop into a writer of some distinction, but for now he is a verbose imitation of the many fantasy authors that have preceded him. Even his decision to frame his story in the form of a trilogy is irritating --- how many trilogies can the world endure? Just because practically every other fantasy author has done it doesn't mean Paolini has to do it as well.Definitely, this is juvenile literature, written by a juvenile author & best left to young readers without much literary experience. Judged on its own merits, this book leaves little lasting impact."

Morris ""Rob & Matt Morris""",6/8,4.0,1166918400,A Well-Turned Tale: For Adults and Kids,"One of the advantages of being a parent is having kids who recommend books for me to read. I am pleased that my son recommended the Harry Potter series to me. Not something I normally would have read, but I enjoyed the series immensely. And now, he is enjoying the Inheritance series by young Christopher Paolini, and convinced me to give it a read. I did so, even after reading the reviews on Amazon that criticized it for being derivative and unoriginal. And while I found certain elements to be derivative, one would have to go back several centuries, way past Tolkien, Lewis, Wagner and the rest, to find a work that is not, to some extent. Most of the modern fantasy stories, the good ones anyways, are heavily influenced by Norse and German mythology, and Eragon is no exception. I do not pretend to be an expert in this area (I am a military historian) but I do know that Tolkein and Lewis also borrowed heavily from ancient legend to craft the Rings books and the Narnia series. Paolini is like a young bard who, having learned from the masters before him, sets out to create his own universe using the rubrics of northern European mythology, and I think he succeeds.I have read all of Tolkein's work, as well as Lewis's, and I found Paolini's book to be as good a read as either. Perhaps because he is less encumbered with the need to pass on the Norse legends, Paolini's narrative flows quickly and there is rarely a break in the action as the story moves foreward. The characters are well-drawn and interesting. None are two-dimensional. The main characters are living, breathing individuals with a combination of good and bad inside. Even the important villains have a reason for being as evil as they are, though I hope Paolini goes into more detail on their backgrounds in books two and three.If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced fantasy adventure, I would highly recommend this book. It's not just for kids. This old dad liked it and is now working on 'Eldest'. Congratulations to my fellow Montanan Paolini on a good read!Four and a half stars."

As many have commented in previous ""reviews"", Paolini's book does have some similarities to Tolkien and other prominent fantasy writers. But with so many fantasy books, it is difficult, if not impossible, to write something completely original. Paolini's work is obviously inspired by the Lord of the Rings, but instead of copying Tolkien's format, he wanders off into his own land, with its own history and own uniqueness. For that, I applaud him.While reading this book, I was immersed into Paolini's, characters, story and world. I began feeling the emotions that the protagonist was experiencing in the story. Is that not the job of a writer? On this level, I believe Paolini was quite successful.However, when I read Eragon as a writer reads, I see some problems with his composition. The most glaring issue is his dialogue. The dialogue itself doesn't have the punch that I would have hoped and it seems as though he tried to come up with as many ways possible to say ""Eragon said."" The true power of the dialogue should be what is said, not how it is said.Finally, I have an issue with some of the other ""reviews"" of Eragon. The trouble with previous reviews is that adults are putting adult perspectives on a book that is intended for students and kids. Overall, I would recommend this book. It is entertaining and it kept me reading. Kids looking for something to fill the LOTR void will enjoy this book; they will look forward to its sequels. As a teacher, I know that kids will appreciate this book and accept it for what it is: a good young adult fantasy book."
500,B000J521DU,"ERAGON: INHERITANCE, BOOK ONE.",,,,0/4,5.0,1143504000,Eragon : I Luv It !!!!,"Eragon, by far, was the best action/adventure book that I've read. It was kind of gory and has quite a bit of blood and destruction. Eragon takes place in a kind of midevil time with dragons, potions, witches/wizards, dwarfs, elves, and swords. Alagaesia, the empire in which Eragon and Saphera live, kind of resembles Alaska as far as the placement of mountians and oceans. Alagaesia even has the shape og Alaska. Anyway, Eragon takes a long journey around Alagaesia chasing the Razac(dark creatures that bring death and dispear, they also killed Eragons uncle)with his companion, Brom. Brom was killed by the Razac when he was found. Eragon's new companion was the son of a forsworn rider. The three(don't forget Saphera) Made their way to the varden. The Varden is a very peaceful place in the mountians outside of the empire. It origanlly belonged and was carved by the dwarfs. The finest marble and the largest precious stones that you'll ever 'see'. When they least expect it, the varden is attacked by the kull, very large and strong urgals controlled by the shade. The shade is a evil wizard like guy that Eragon must defeat. The bad thing is, the shade is the most powerful being on the planet and only 2 people in all of the peoples living days have fought aganst a shade and lived. Eragon is facing the bigest life and death situation of his life.... Suddenly, Saphera burst out of the dragon hold and distracted the shade. Eragon gets a good shotat the heart and the shades mind. He makes a stab with his sword, hits the target, and watches the shade vaporize into nowhere. The shade is dead.I reccomend this book for boys mostly because of all of the blood and stuff girls might not like, but haygirls, im not stoppin you from reading it!! Also, if you are like me and only are intrested in action/adventure series books, read on!!!!"

If you're really bored.,"Are people really so starved for fantasy that they think this book is good or well written? I can only assume that the positive reviews are from the extremely sheltered. Otherwise they would recognize the cliched and painfully predictable plot from page one. They would see that the characters are the mediocre type casting of someone with little imagination. That the ""surprizes"" in the plot are anything but surprizing.But even though reviewer after reviewer points out the obvious people continue to say that this is a highly original work. That they think it's the best fantasy they've ever read. That everyone should read this book.I will spell it out for you. This-book-is-not-good. If you are starved for entertainment, as I was, then check it out from your local library. No need to waste your money on the hardcover or paperback.Why is it bad? It is poorly written because I failed to find a single original thing in the book.First: take the characters from Star Wars. Brom is Obi Wan. Eragon is Luke. Murtagh makes a good Han Solo. Not to mention Arya as Princess Leia. Then you add dragon riding instead of Jedi training. The dragonriding is a faint shadow of The Dragonriders of Pern series. Once again, nothing new here. Add a mockery of the magic system devised by Ursula LeGuinn. Then add the monsters from Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time series. Urgals instead of Trollocs, and a Shade instead of a Fade. The differences are enough to almost seem original. Then sprinkle heavily with elves and dwarves straight out of Tolkien. (Or is that Dungeons and Dragons?)Even all that could be forgiven if the story itself had been original in the least. But no, we are treated with a plot as bland and prepackaged as a McDonald's hamburger. No plot twist is surprizing. No character entrance or death is not expected. Reading this book was like watching a made-for-cable movie. The idea sounds good, but it just falls short in the execution."

My review will help.,"Good things first, since I feel like being generous and caring. This book has its issues, yes, but here are someone things to help your decision on why to buy this book. After all, we aren't here to debate if Eragon should have been published or not.Good item number one: This book reads fast, despite its size.Good item number two: Many kids, with the number of young authors falling daily, will find this book inspiring. After all, it was written by a fifteen year old peer.Good item number three: Some kids (please excuse the following information as coming from another person) do not have the attention spans to sit and read through the Lord of the Rings. They're intimidating books to someone whose just out of chapter books.Good item number four: It was interesting; I finished it in two days. Why I gave it two stars comes next.Bad items, yes, there are many. Here's how to use this review. If the above four outway the following one, two, three, four, five......etc.....then buy this book. I'm pretty sure most kids under 12 will enjoy this book.Bad item number uno: Characters aren't nearly as devloped and captivating as most teens (Paolini's target age group) like to see. Personally, I really only cared for the dragon.Bad item number two: Relatively classic plot and execution. Left with nice plot holes to be patched poorly later.....sorry, lost the neutrality. Yes, there are some gaping holes in this book that should have been resolved more before publication.Bad item number three: The emotions characters should leak out of you is absent. in other words, if something happened to a character, I couldn't care less. If the world came to be ruled by the evil person, I could not care less.Bad item number four(corresponds with bad item number three): The author needs to do less telling, more showing...... The reason I couldn't care less is because I'm given no reason to fear or dread the stereotypical evil person. I'm only given the anger and hatred of the 'good guys', who i really don't care for, so again, I couldn't care less.Bad item number five: author trys to sound like an expert on war and battle, swords and weapons. By trying to give too much detail in cities defenses and battlements, armor, and weapons, in attempt, of course, to make it sound believable, the author does the opposite. He 'reveals his weaknesses' too much. I'm not expecting Paolini to be an expert, but he shouldn't act or pertend to be one. Writer to writer (yes, I write) Paolini, find your strengths and use them. Avoid the weaknesses, but not too much.Bad item number six: author likes to repeat phrases over an over again. Several times I read: a (scream, cry) tore from (his, her) lips. It is a nice phrase, yes, but it suffers from overuse.Bad item number seven: unlike bad item number six, author, in trying to show off his ability, UNDER uses the word said. Yes, that was a petty number seven, but it gets worse. Some of those substited words should be used sparringly, but aren't. Also, many of the alternates don't seem to fit in with the dialogue. It is okay to use said. As a writer, I limit my words to said, whisper, murmur, mutter, and exclaimed. You might never come across a 'banter' or 'barked' in any work of mine. (Except the previous sentence, of course)Bad item number eight: There are a LOT of rip offs in the story. Take Lord of the Rings setting, combine with Star Wars plot, add Dragonriders of Pern characters. Garnish with doxens of other works. No baking necessary, things don't need to blend. Congrats, you've just made Eragon all over again.Bad item number nine: Things are a little too convenient for the main character. He always gets saved after he faints or gets knoced out. I don't know if this is supposed to be a ""Alagaesia's hero is a kind of a loser who hasn't stayed awake to see the end of a fight"" but it does get annoying.Bad reason item ten: Ah, yes, one of my favorite bad items. This book is written in third-person limited. That POV doesn't allow for things from OUR world, Earth, to creep in. I do not think Alagaesia would have seen a mummy, much less know how one unravels........Bad item number eleven:I'll make this the final one. A major plot hole that keeps nagging at me. 1) dragon scales are ,emtioned to me as solid as armor, yet an arrow peirces it and goes straight to the dragon's heart, killing it. 2) dragons are mentioned to be full grown, later they are mentioned to never stop growing. Editing, bad job on that one....Yes, there you have it. If you couldn't care less about the bad items, or they are outweighed, go buy this book, though I say try the paperback version, it would be a better buy. If you're about even, go check it out from our local library or borrow it from a friend. If you are appalled by the bad items, turn away and run, there are better books to buy, and you're wasting your time reading all these reviews....."

As stated in other reviews, it was derivative and clich&eacute;. It had all of the same elements as every other bland fantasy book, along with the extra baggage of a teen-aged writer trying to flex underdeveloped vocabulary muscle--one gets the feeling that Paolini wrote the book with his high school vocabulary lists on one side, a dictionary on the other, and classic fantasy books in his lap. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, and the reader finds it hard to care about any of the characters because they're not well developed. One of the review blurbs on the dustjacket's back calls Eragon a ""precocious debut."" I think that's true; but Paolini's quite aware that he's out of his league, and tries to compensate for his uninspired vision by using big words as well as stereotypic characters and generic action sequences. Unless Fox makes some drastic changes in dialogue and character development in its upcoming film adaptation, the movie will flop due to poor critical reviews and snickering, exhasperated audiences. Hopefully the rest of the planned trilogy will improve the story and make ""Inheritance"" worth the readers' time and money."

Any fan of that famous galaxy far, far away will be astounded by Christopher Paolini's lack of shame. He might want you think this is a homage to Star Wars, but I know what a homage is. When you change the names of characters and places, but keep the plotline and pretend its a different story, then its not a homage, its a rip-off!!In the story, the land of Alagaesia is ruled by a tyrannical Empire (an obvious theft), and the only hope is a band of rebels known as the Verdan (Rebellion), and the last remaining dragon rider (jedi knight). That hero happens to be a young boy living in a poor household, and whose adoptive parent eventually gets killed (oh, come on!!). He is taught to become a warrior by a retired rider named Brom (Obi-Wan Kenobi). There is also an elf maiden named Arya (Princess Leia), who gets kidnapped by the evil Durza (Darth Vader). I can go on and on.Still, it is entertaining to read because you are always curious as to how these books will sink with the movie (not the Eragon movie). Plus, it's hard for me to put a story down.

Admittedly, by the fourth chapter, I was weary. There was hardly any dialogue, and while the imagery was vivid, some of the descriptions went on into overkill. However, this was not enough to feign my interest, because by the time Saphira (the dragon) was introduced into young Eragon's life, I was intrigued enough to commit to the lengthy novel. This was a good choice, because by the time Eragon is preparing to leave home and go on his journey, the story has picked up quite and bit and became thoroughly enjoyable.Eragon's journey with Brom, the old storyteller, is a fascinating and touching part of this fantastic epic, though no relationship in this book can be compared to that of Eragon and Saphira. She calls him little one, for God's sake. Very cute, and successfully shows that the dragons in the world of Alagaesia are not beasts, but magical creatures that may even be mentally superior to humans. The rest of the story, including the foreshadowing of a budding romance between our hero and an elven woman, an escape to a sanctuary (the Varden), two tragic deaths, and a war between good and evil.This book kicks off The Inheritance Trilogy with a bang, and overall, I have to say that this piece of work is a great book. Not only that, I must say that I envy the young Paolini for his mastery of the English language, as well as his vast and seemingly endless vocabulary. My one complaint, other then the somewhat slow start? Eragon falls asleep and wakes up about a million times over the cores of the book!Forget what everyone else says, pick up ""Eragon"" for yourself, and keep an open mind. You'll enjoy it!8 out of 10"

Unfortantly I am one of those people who sits in the movie theaters and shouts out the story line before it happens and it is suprising, not to mention embarssing, when I am wrong. Eragon was one of those books I should tape my mouth shut for. This book combines the both a well thought out story line that is interesting and a world fully created and decribed by Christopher.

He is no match for Tolkien's superb writing style. However he started writing this book out of his love for fantasy back when he was 15. He didn't try to cash on other peoples success; he wrote the book because he enjoyed writing. Money and fame came much later. And because of that, despite shared elements with other great works, his book is an original story that especially young readers will enjoy."

I agree with some of the other reviews that this book is just too similar to many of the other dragon/middle earth type fantasies. On the other hand, if you like that kind of thing, that isn't much of a deterrent.My biggest issue has been that while the first book was good enough and easy to plow through, the second one was a little drier and the third was an endless dragging on of every mundane detail. It does include the full saga of a revolution which of course entails more than a one-battle victory, but Paolini might as well tell you everytime Eragon sneezes or picks dirt from his fingernails in between. You can't fault him for leaving anything out, but I found myself glazing over, waiting for the plot to pick up again. In addition, the writing itself is not challenging, but then I believe its only intended as entertainment. I don't think that there are too many characters or places to follow (especially with a map insert to follow for fun), but I do feel that most of the characters are underdeveloped. Unfortunately, Eragon is the worst. Three books in and I am still waiting for a personality to emerge. On the converse, I suppose it is a device well recognized in anime illustration, where the main character is a nondescript as possible to encourage the reader/viewer to relate. I just wish he was more of an inspiration, role model or hero.All that being said, the first book is not bad. The plot is interesting enough and I don't know too many young readers who could read it and not imagine what it would be like to be that special kid selected by destiny to be a great dragon rider. If this is your genre, go ahead, pick this book up, but do so in a paperback. I'm afraid this one falls a bit short of becoming a timeless classic."

Mr. Paolini has an astounding grasp of dialogue and sets a scene better than a lot of authors old enough to be his parents (if not his grandparents even). His characters have depth, including flaws, and come across very three-dimensional instead of the paper cut-out roles I've read in many similar novels.This book is well-paced. It doesn't drag despite the distance and time covered by the characters. Mr. Paolini's fantasy world is well-constructed and believable.There is plenty of action, although it lacks a lot of the gore that Fantasy authors tend to fill their pages with.

Christopher Paolini began writing the book when he was just 15 years old and he published it on 22 April 2004 in the United States.The book tells the story of the 15-years-old Eragon, who lives with his uncle and his cousin in the small village Carvahall. Someday he finds a mysterious, blue stone in the mountains. Eragon attempts to sell it and therefore he takes the stone to a trader specializing in jewels. But the trader says to him, that he has never seen anything like this before. Soon afterward Eragon realizes that the stone is actually a dragon egg and as it hatches into a dragon he names Saphira. After a few days two mysterious strangers enter the town looking for the dragon. Saphira leaves the town with Eragon and while Eragon is away the mysterious strangers kill his uncle and put his yard on fire. On his return Eragon meets Brom the village storyteller, who wants to flee Carvahall with Eragon and Saphira. At the evening Brom explains to Eragon the situation, in the process he says that Eragon is the last Dragon Rider. A long time ago the Dragon Riders were peacekeepers with magic skills, but then the evil king Galbatorix has killed them and now this evil king wants to kill Eragon. On their journey Brom helps Eragon to discover his magical abilities, but they are lured into a trap of the evil forces. Brom dies and before his death he reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider and that his dragon was murdered by Galbatorix. Brom advices Eragon to find the ,,Varden"" (These are rebels who are fighting against Galbatorix). When Eragon finds the secret hiding of the Varden, Galbatorix sends an army to this place. A battle that everything decides is coming...I really enjoyed reading the book, because the story is very exciting and the characters are well presented.

A teen-aged boy finds a dragon, Saphira, and sets out to avenge the death of his uncle, battling the forces of darkness along the way. The best part -- this book was written by a boy who is about the same age as the hero, Eragon. The result is authentic storytelling.Eragon, the main character, grows from a naive hunter to a budding Dragon Rider with the powers of magic. Knowing that Paolini started the book at the age of 15 gives credence to his view of the loss of a relative, young love and crushes, oppression of well-meaning teachers, and the looming dark forces of evil kings and wicked sorcerers. The result is striking. This book gives readers a peek at how teenagers feel about the world around them, which older and more powerful people control, not unlike the perspective of most teenagers.Other reviews that pooh-pooh Eragon should cool their heels, get over their jealousy and realize that this book is fresh and entertaining. Some have said that Paolini has 'ripped off' other fantasy writers. They have somehow forgotten that the genre of fantasy -- the world of elves, dwarves, dragons, and wizards -- has been well developed by previous writers, most notably Tolkien. Those who pick up the torch of fantasy story-telling need not recreate that world, which makes it the perfect playground for young writers such as Paolini because they need not remake what has already been mapped out. The same is true of writing about the mafia in New York City, for example. The skyscrapers, taxicabs, and gun-wielding thugs in dark coats need not be recreated. Paolini chose a perfect subject to launch his writing career on because he can legitimately rely on those masters who have already created the fantasy realm.Finally, the critics of Paolini betray their jealousy too easily. Anyone who has written a novel or short story and has tried to sell it knows that there is a sea of self-involved souls who view other writers as competition and take every opportunity to tear down others on the way to success. They cloak themselves in the skin of creative criticism but they possessed by the spirit of If-I-Can't-Publish-Neither-Can-You. Do not listen to those that attack Paolini because of his age. They are merely frustrated after years of trying to publish their own boring works, and now are enraged that someone so young could find success so early. Well, more power to Paolini. He has given us an entertaining read and a new look at fantasy from a fresh perspective."

That is an incredible feat, which would be more remarkable if the ideas portrayed in the story hadn't already been used. Sure the captivating story of a young boy who is lost in the world and is just trying to figure out his place is interesting, but the interest tends to fade about the one-thousandth time you read it. The other flaw that I found in the book was the familiar characters from J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings Trilogy-The elf with mysterious powers-the dwarves that tunnel underground-The monstrous creation of a seemingly unbeatable army and the familiarity of names such as, Arya and Arwen, Eragon and Aragorn, Urgals and Orcs. I also observed a dash of Harry Potter magic between the pages. I hold a love for Fantasy novels, but just because it is catagorized as a fantasy doesn't mean it has to include elves dwarves, magic, and dragons- I think the tires on that wagon are running thin (the extreme length of the story didn't help either). I look for a fantasy novel that invents new ideas and new creatures for the mind to explore, that it why I rated this book as a TWO. I also like a novel that can keep my attention for the entirety which Eragon also lacked to do.

I must say, if you like fantasy, you will definately like this book. And the first thing you will notice is that it has every aspect you can think of, or at least recognize, from other fantasy and sci-fi novels - common ones in fact. This leaves the story dry at times, as Paolini tries to rush into things, especially at the beginning. It seems when you read the first few chapters, you've already read half the book. But his writing is wonderful for someone so young to be published, I must give him credit on that.But things that caught my eye is the way he practically excerpts other fantasy books, most of which you may have read already. Reading about trolls, dwarves, and elves and the ""Ancient Language"" was practically cut from Lord of the Rings, and even by just watching the movie, everything that relates is clearly evident. Also, I am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan of her Dragonriders novels, and I felt a bit strange to see it ""ripped off"" so to speak...He speaks of ""Dragon Riders"", as of course the main character (Eragon), goes through the similar process of obtaining a dragon as ""Dragonriders of Pern"" novels write, and McCaffrey's books are practically a legacy. Simply, Eragon finds a ""rock"" (it's really a dragon egg) that hatches into a dragon and connects ""mentally"" with his mind, ect. Brom even explains the dragon chooses the person, and all of that seems directly taken from the Pern novels. A bit different, all in the end.As good as a writer he is at his age, there are still things that he needs to work on. I'm not a genuis writer myself, but you will find yourself baffling at times when a random comment/explanation comes up in the middle of an unrelated conversation, which leads to more and more unrelated ideas. It seems Paolini put more ""information"" into his characters rather than personality, which leaves it bluntly, DRY. You will quickly get over his ""saids"" and ""dids"" at first, and become used to the over-under descriptiveness, or the more/less detail needed for a certain situation. But the book is great, and will keep you reading for a while (as thick as it is).Final conclusion - not for hardcore fantasy readers. I'm not even a hardcore fantasy reader, and I still feel like I'm reading 10 books at once, all ideas taken from other books (Tolkien, McCaffrey, ect). It's not necessarily a ""fresh"" new fantasy world with beliefs, ect, but certainly enjoyable to most."

My husband and I have created a habit of me reading aloud to him in the evenings. We started just before HP6 came out, going through the whole series in just over two months. Since we have finished that I have been looking for another series to read to him. One of our 17-year- old's friends let me borrow Eragon, knowing of our tradition and liking for this style of reading. Despite the sometimes juvenile feel, it was a wonderfully cozy book. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini for his courage to write his book. Who better to write a book about a young man coming of age while having to make adult decisions, than a young man.To those critics who don't like it, fine. Just remember, he will only get better with time and experience. Give him a chance."

It started out pretty weird, but by the time I got to the end of the second chapter I was hooked. Eragon is a book written in the calibur of Lord of the Rings (I don't consider myself to be exaggerating one bit), but not as violent, and better for younger audiences. I'd recommend ages 13+, not because of content (though there is some violence), but because younger kids might not be able to understand some vocabulary.

Before you start thinking that I didn't like the book-remember that I really did enjoy it. However, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and a fan of The Lord of the Rings, I could not help but notice numerous parallels. The characters for starters: Eragon-name that sounds like Aragon (the hero in The Lord of the Rings) and has a very similar destiny as Aragon's. Also, Eragon closely resembles Harry Potter-two confused teens who are of low self-esteem and are having trouble accepting their destinies as two of the most powerful people in their worlds. On the other hand, the Shade is akin to Saruman (LOTR), Golbitrox to Sauron (LOTR) and to Voldemort (HP), the urgals and the kull to the orcs, etc. Furthermore, the theme of Eragon and LOTR is incredibly similar in that a fellowship go and try to rid their world's of evil and establish justice, peace, and prosperity.If you are able to get over these parallels among countless others, then read-I certainately got over them and was enveloped into this kid's epic tale."

And while I have to say, yes, at the beginning one cannot help but think about Tolkien and compare the two (it's inevitable), but after the first couple chapters, I forgot all about the comparisons and got into the story for its own merits. There are many ways to depict a struggle between men, dragons, elves and dwarves without 'ripping off' Tolkien. And Christopher Paolini's mythology of the Dragon Riders is absorbing, as is the the wonderful relationship between Eragon and his dragon Saphira. I found myself racing to the end of the book, and I can't wait for the release of Book 2. So read it for its own sake, not because people say it's a take on Tolkien.

That seems cool, especially for a teen or preteen audience. However, the obvious problem with Eragon hits like a brick wall. In high school I had friends who wrote fan fiction for whatever fantasy series was currently popular. Eragon reads like that fiction. The language is stilted with layers stiff sounding words. It has long words but doesn't flow. The plot is also soooo predictable and derivative: dragons, magic, etc. All the cliches are there and the author is taking them seriously, not putting them there to build up a cliche and then knock it for comic relief (no comic relief in the book by the way). Plotwise imagine a lifeless parody of fantasy literature.Now coming from your friend's notebook during recess that is fine and if a friend wrote this and asked me for pointers I wouldn't bash them. There is a huge difference between reading a published book and reading something a friend passes to you. Different expectations will leave you disappointed unless you are a proud parent or close friend of Chris Paolini.An aside on teens writing fiction: The Distant Soil series by Colleen Doran was published in installments starting when she was in her teens. That was an intricate and well done fantasy series by a teen (although perhaps not suitable for teens).I recommend that you find another book to read. This book will waste your time. Read reviews to find a better fantasy book. If you are looking for a book to give as a gift to a teen or preteen then there are definitely better choices. Look elsewhere."

He then realizes he can't live a normal life and embarks on a journey with a village storyteller, Brom. Brom teaches him to fight in sword and magic. Telling anything past this would be a spoiler, so you'll have to read it for yourself.My favorite part of this story is when Eragon and his allies, the Varden, fight a war with the Urgals, which are human like except they're bigger. I like it because it is fast paced, full of swords and magic. This is especially true when Eragon fights a Shade, which is basically a possessed human. It's a fight between two skilled swordsmen/magic users, so it'll keep you on edge until the other is dead. This conquest over the Shade gains him the alias ""Eragon Shadeslayer"".

Fantasy is one of my favorite genres (lots of McCaffrey and Tolkein) so I had high hopes despite the fact that I had actually not purchased the book earlier because the jacket design looked rather childish. I had no idea until halfway through the book that Christopher Paolini started writing Eragon at 15. I discovered this, however, because I had gotten frustrated with the writing and needed to take a break, so I read the author bio in the back.He was 15 and boy does it show. If I had to describe the book in three words they would be repetitive, derivative, and undeveloped.Repetitive- How many times can this flipping kid Eragon fight someone, pass out, and wake up safe and sound in a warm bed soon after? It happened so many times in the book I literally threw it on the floor in disgust at one point. It was like playing an RPG!Derivative- I know Paolini probably couldn't help himself and didn't know he was doing it but he has blatantly copied storylines and lore from some of the best authors in the business. Though having grown up with McCaffrey and Tolkein it can be hard to imagine the realm of fantsy in any terms other than their own. The relationship of men and dragons is straight McCaffrey, I am absolutely certain that the third book will contain a ""Luke, I am your father"" moment with Eragon and Galbatorix, and the Kull are so derivative of Tolkein's Uruk-hai I have actually called them that while discussing the book with my father.Underdeveloped- Good lord. The writing. The characters are so undeveloped, and until about halfway through the book (when I suspect his mother began helping him) Paolini showed absolutely no inclination to include scene-setting details or incidents that don't advance the plot but do flesh out the story. He just goes from fight to fight to fight, with nobody having truly compelling reasons for anything they do. What is worse is that he is not very good at describing the fights themselves, so they all run together. His foreshadowing is glaringly obvious (I use Brom's true occupation and the uses of the really big slide to illustrate this). He fails to evoke empathy for his characters, and he even wrote in a mommy and daddy to usher Eragon through the story (Saphira and Brom). The first half of the story, before the dramatic shift in writing style (but unfortunately not plot development) reads like a story my brother wrote about a spy when he was in 7th grade.Incidentally, given the colors of the gemstones he named in his description of Tronjheim, the city-mountain sounds exceptionally ugly.He also failed to create a nuanced, compelling kingdom or distinct races. All the names across every race sound similar, different races' languages all sound the same...the only difference is their physical descriptions.All this being said, I do not think he is a bad writer. I think he is merely inexperienced. It is obvious from his writing that Paolini did not spend much time out of his bedroom as a child, so he has very little by way of experience to bring to his novel. His characters are so pitifully developed because he really only has the emotions and responses he has observed in himself and his parents to draw from. I think with a little time and a lot more real-world experience he could be an excellent fantasy writer.I wouldn't recommend this book to a discerning fantasy reader, it is my Dad's opinion that at the ripe old age of 20 I could write something better, but for a younger boy it would be just the thing."

I believe that christopher paolini should be in prison for copyright infringement. He ripped right off Star Wars, which itself wasn't even that good. If you're going to steal ideas, steal GOOD ideas.Okay, I take it back. I've read books far worse than Eragon (for example, maya angelou's books all suck). But that doesn't mean that Eragon should be given leeway. And he shouldn't be given leeway just because he WAS a teenager. Lots of teenagers write great books.

Only to find, Lo! The previous review says exactly what I wanted to say. Had this been written by anyone but a 17 year old, it would not receive the volumes of praise being heaped upon it. As a 20 year veteran of the high school English classroom, this is exactly the sort of over-the-top, rehash-every-trope-I've-ever read sort of fiction I'd expect my creative writing students to turn out. As Paolin matures and develops the confidence to travel into less well-known, more imaginative, territory, I'm sure he'll turn out some interesting fantasy. As it is, anyone who has read the fantasy canon will experience deja vu repeatedly as they make their way through this novel. One can argue that most fantasy is derivative--Tolkien borrowed from the various world mythologies, for example--but the very best fantasy carries a depth of tone and meaning simply missing here. Paolin has taken all the fantasy motifs and plot elements (the quest, the sword, the wise elder with a secret past, the dragon/rider bond (stolen from McCaffrey in such a blatant way I'm surprised she can't sue!), etc and simply strung them together with no consideration for the more archetypal meaning. And the writing style is that of the above-mentioned precocious teenager, with its purple prose and loaded adjectives: ""He found a sympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent reasoning and the use of dark secrets, he inflamed the Rider against their elders. Together they treacherously lured and killed and elder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his enemy and slaughtered him without warning."" I was laughing so hard at this point, my fiancee asked me what I was reading. Suffice it to say that, when Galbatorix wins his showdown with the good dragon rider by kicking him in the groin (excuse me, ""the fork of his legs"") this becomes not epic fantasy, but farce.Having said all that, if it gets kids to read, more power to it. And maybe they'll then move on to the really great fantasy: Tolkien and LeGuin and McKillip, and Kay, among others. Paolin is trying to fill big shoes; given time, I hope he can. Good fantasy is hard to find."

Yes, there are many similarities, but on the whole, the story is very original and, most importantly, wildly entertaining and engrossing. The book pulls you in from the very first paragraph of the prologue, when we are introduced to a character called a Shade (can't wait to see him in the movie) who is chasing after an elf in possession of some sort of precious stone. The meaning and purpose of the stone can be found within the amazing 497 pages of this book. The characters are great and you find yourself either rooting for them, crying for them, or hating them (in a good way). The best part about this book is that it is only the first of a trilogy, and its author is only 21 years old, so there is much more to come from Paolini. Quite simply, if you are a fantasy fan, you cannot go wrong with Eragon. It is destined to be a classic."

It seemed like I was traveling with Eragon and felt his emotions through the entire story. I especially enjoyed flipping to the maps on the inside of both covers to follow Eragon's wandering path through ALAGASIA.I cannot believe a fifteen-year-old could write such a gripping tale! He excellently portrays Eragon and shows how he matures from a farm boy to a young man who learns a great deal as his adventure progresses. Paolini shows that all the choices Eragon makes will affect him (positively or negatively) in his future. Paolini is a mastermind and better hurry up writing the next book in the trilogy.

But I must be honest, I'm not going to make this book sound better then I thought it was simply because it is considered a classic. The only redeeming quality this book really has is the overall idea and like many reviewers have already pointed out - the idea is good, the execution of said idea is quite lacking.This story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. Unlike the firemen of today, these firemen burn books rather than put out fires. The world has become a dystopian society that favors pleasure over reality. We almost have a 'stepford-society' of sorts. Critical thinking is said to create sadness and conflict so something must be done about it. The books must be burned.In Fahrenheit 451 Montag has an epiphany after talking with his light-hearted neighbor Clarisse. Clarisse represents the very thing this society is trying to rid. Guy Montags wife represents the opposite. You can already see the conflict here, so what is Guy to do?I'll admit the first 40 pages or so really had me going. The story was unique and the message was interesting. I did notice right away that Bradbury likes to be overly-poetic in some parts, and a straight-shooter in others. His writing is a little inconsistent but I was able to look past that. At first I really hated Montags wife (a good thing, when books conjure up these types of feelings then they are doing their job) and I really felt empathetic towards Guy. The problem is that this book really started becoming silly. The characters really become forced and the plot as a whole takes an eye-rolling turn for the worst. The ending is one of the most forced endings I've ever read. This book could have been written a million different ways and Bradbury chose a really silly path. I had to force myself to finish the book and I started to lose my feelings towards the main characters, I just started to not care anymore. It's almost as if Bradbury had a good idea for a short-story one day and forced it into a novel.In the end I would give this book a 2.5/5. There are some interesting ideas and some of the writing is pretty good, though it is inconsistent. Unfortunately I can't give half-stars so it's either a 2 or a 3. Tough choice but ultimately this book was more on the disappointing end of the spectrum for me."

So amazing in fact that I did my senior research paper on it. The plot is about Guy Montag (protagonist) learning about censorship and the death that accompanies it. The symbolism is very deep in this book. For example, the story mentions burning books, which is linked to destroying knowledge. Through intricately woven twists, it becomes apparent that Bradbury wants us to realize that knowledge and individuality are the keys to being alive and that when those are lost, regardless of our medical condition, we are dead.The obvious theme is of course censorship, but if you're willing to read it carefully and give some serious thought as to what's being said, you can see a much deeper message. This book should be required for admittance to society. Read it. You won't be disappointed.And don't pay any attention to those negative reviews - they are the people that this book talks about: the morons in our society who don't see the folly of ignorance."

The futuristic society depicted by Bradbury in the 1950's is almost frightening because of how closely it resembles the world that we live in now. We have filled our lives with technology and arguably have become more removed from society than ever before. Instead of sitting on the porch and conversing while watching the sunset or listening to crickets we tend to turn our television sets and let the propaganda and the garbage be forced down our gullets. This book opens your eyes and paints the picture of a very feasible and very scary future and it forces you to be aware of what is happening around us.I have read positive reviews from people who love this book and also reviews from those that think it is an overrated piece of garbage. When forging my own opinion of this book I look at the messages that Bradbury seems to be trying to convey and how well he does that. I have found that the most acclaimed message in the book is that propaganda and technology are poison to the human mind. The book creates a world where human beings have been hollowed out by these things and have become nothing more than automated drones seeking only entertainment - and to be free from worry and woe. Bradbury has said that the theme of his book is that television takes away the desire for people to read and appreciate literature.Aside from the previously mentioned theme - I feel that the most spectacular part of this read is the satirical society that Ray Bradbury has created. I feel the message goes further than television eats away at your mind. I found that the most significant message in the story is that technology as a whole is dangerous to us. The book illustrates how technology has people moving faster and faster and becoming detached from each other (comparable to real life). People in the society only care about what is on television, or about driving a 100 Miles Per Hour, or going to amusement parks. Families are not close-knit; people send their children away to school and never really know them. It seems that every person in the world around the main characters are completely empty and do not care about the well being of anyone. This is one of the most interesting points of analysis that I have found in this book. Comparing this to how people are becoming in real life. It is almost hard to admit how similar our world is to the horrible place from Bradbury's imagination.I cannot say that this is the greatest book that I have ever read, but I did really enjoy it. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read. I find it to be extremely interesting from cover to cover. It is a book that you can read several times and come away with different ideas and messages each time."

Before I read this book, I always used to think that it would be cool and a lot better if books did not exist in the world. However, I realized that without books nobody would have their own views on certain subjects, and everyone would be dull like Montag's wife. This fantasy no longer appeals to me, because I hate talking to people like Mildred. Everyone would live in their virtual world and the television would tell them what to think. I like the fact that Montag is forced to think about what he is doing, and he steals books because he has a desire to learn. I feel that I would have done the same thing in his situation, and I feel that I am a lot like him because I like to go with the flow but I don't agree with everything, and I question what I feel is wrong. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who feels the world would be a better place without books."

In a world where time is scarce, I neglected this classic work by Ray Bradbury. I regret this situation very much. ""Fahrenheit 451"" is a modern classic that deserves to be read. The individual is poorer for not having done so.If the novel has any message, it is that censorship is a very great danger. In the extreme case, we have the official authorisation of book burning. Books contain evil thoughts and encourage individuals to think for themselves. If books are removed from society then the power to control the individual is that much greater.Although written more than fifty years ago, ""Fahrenheit 451"" still resonates today. Yes, the evils of the Soviet Union and its satellites are no longer with us and the cold war has been left to the dustbin of history. However, whenever given the chance, governments of all colours just love to seek control through censorship. Even in the west, governments hanker for greater control as a means of stemming the growth of terrorism or whatever else they deem to be a danger to them. As citizens, we should always question any attempt to increase the power of government over what the population can read or watch or listen. We must always be vigilant.Ray Bradbury is a man of great prescience. ""Fahrenheit 451"" can legitimately be compared with the master works of George Orwell. This is true praise as Orwell rests in the pantheon of the geniuses and Bradbury deserves his place in the sun just as much."
614,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,,,1/1,5.0,919209600,More relevant than ever,"It's the late '50s, I'm in my early teens, cutting my teeth into English, and gobbling up scifi by the truckload, from Asimov all the way through the alphabet down to Wells. Occasionally, I reread those books, and some of them still flare up my imagination. F451 is one of those. There is a misconception that scifi authors must predict the future in minute detail, the more so if they deal with social issues, lest their work becomes &quot;dated&quot;. Not so; good authors write about the present. If one chooses to select current trends and extrapolate them, it's irrelevant how accurate a prophet one is. It matters not whether or not firemen will ever go from firefighters to firesetters. What matters is that Bradbury foresaw, and denounced, a society drowned in entertainment - worse still, &quot;infotainment&quot; -, assailed by a barrage of GUIs, emoticons, acronyms, shoot-'em-down, trigger-happy computer games, &quot;educational&quot; software that is none other than, &quot;interactive&quot; TV shows plastered on wall-sized screens, complete with FX and surround sound ... And never a moment to be alone with ourselves and just plain think. From readers'comments, I garner F451 is being given as an assignment to 7th and 8th graders. Too little, too late. Their brains have already been washed away by too much through the day MTV, and no week in Paris - or Mars - will ease the bite of it."
615,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,ADM7Z034FEABK,Kyriarch,0/2,2.0,990144000,I had high hopes,"First off, I have to say that the idea isn't that far fetched. It's hard to imagine that someone in 1953 could depict our life so close to what it is like today. Television seems to run our lives and less people settle themselves in books. I say this because I'm one of them, although I do enjoy a good sci-fi novel (ie. 1984, Dune, Brave New World). That said, I have to conclude that Bradbury did in fact write a flop! It is true what they say about how you can't buy a book by it's cover. I, just as many others, was encouraged to read from the title. The concept is excellent and to a point, realistic. What seems &quot;wrong&quot; with the book however is the lack of depth the other characters have. Clarise, the girl who turned Guy Montag's head in the other direction, who had great potential, dies in the begining of the book. Her death seems meaningless as a result of lack of depth... Mildred, Guy's wife, who turns in her own husband, also lacks depth. The second reason which makes this book a flop is the lack of a conclusion. Not to spoil the ending of these great literary pieces, but the main characters in 1984, Brave New World, and Dune either die, are defeated, or emerge victorious (not in that order). But in F451, Guy ends up roaming the lands with a bunch of Harvard and Yale hobos. The government, Big Brother, or whatever you want to call it, which was so obviously against him, couldn't care less if he existed. And Guy's cause failed to alter anything, other than relocating him to the woods. There seemed to be no major conflict. Sure, people will argue that the chase was a conflict, but it was not solved. Now, if this book was part of a trilogy, then maybe there is some reason to leaving the question unanswered to what was the purpose of Guy's puiny uproar. But the fact is that the book is cut short. It deserved a better ending or even a better beginning. Whatever the case I felt thirsty for more at the end of the book, I had many questions unanswered, like what really happened to Clarisse, was she killed by a racing car or was she hiding from the government too? Does Faber get in touch with those printing guys or is he caught by Big Brother? There needn't be a happy ending, but to deprive the audience of an ending of any type spells out B A D S T Y L E."

The characters in the novel I thought were very well developed and gave enough detail to make you get a picture in your mind about what he/she looked like. The character that I thought was the best developed out of them all was Guy Montag. He was described physically but also mentally so you could really understand what he was thinking in certain cituations, like how he goes against his heritage of a fireman and decides to start reading books. Guy was a fireman, and firemen in these times burned books. The book says "" First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin"" (64)I also like the technology of the novel. The technology was very relavent to what is reaslistic. The ear peaces that they wore to listen to the radio could become very popular in the near future. When Clarisse McClellan said ""...did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last"" (39). This shows what society was and that technology got so fast that they had to change billboards.The setting of the novel was developed well also. The setting was in a futuristic city, which seemed very high paced, like I would envision most large cities to become in the future.I did not like the fact that people did not have there own feelings about things. They never came up with there own ideas and just seemed to go through everyday monotonously. I do not agree that this is what the future holds and that people pride themselves on having there own ideas.I also disagreed with that nobody likes books and doesn't read them anymore. I feel that it was not a good idea to say that nobody reads and most of the people don't mind that. I would think that if people enjoyed reading like the group led by Granger, there would be violent revolts. When Mildred says ""...Why should I read? What for..."" (101). It shows that people had no desire to read or what reading had in store for them.Overall the book was very good and I suggest that you should read it if you are in the mood for an action novel."

I would call this book a classic, and wonderful. Bradbury really grabs the reader with the way he discribes everything. It is almost like reading a collection of poems that are in sequence. I highly recommend this wonderful master piece."
619,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,AJ98YA4Y333BK,"CJA ""CJA""",0/0,4.0,1361145600,Intriguing and Still Relevant,"Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia."

It's a quick read, and I'm busy so it was nice to have an interesting story with some depth. Sometimes I get too busy and it's hard when I'm reading a long book and try to come back to it from a prolonged absence. 451 is around 165 pages, with really no slow tedious parts, which helps keep you on track.The gist of the book is a futuristic society/science fiction. Formerly a banned book, it suggests patterns of human behavior that very well may be the result of the changing patterns of society today. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, however it is his job to burn books, and the houses that they are in. The question of what is in the books he is burning perplexes him, and it pushes him to the extreme. According to the author, Ray Bradbury, this book is just set in the future, no specific time frame, however in this futuristic world, knowledge is considered dangerous.One thing I would like to mention again is the pattern of society and social interaction. There are very little social interactions between people; they don't talk just to talk. There is very little regard for human life, and they speak of death and especially suicide as if it was as common as waking up in the morning. ""The Family"" entrances people for hours, and TV is now the size of the entire wall, and is nothing more but shapeless programs of color and video clips no longer than 10 seconds. Wages are much less than in today's world, for Guy Montag, $6,000.00 is his income for an entire year, and he would be considered middle to upper class.Personally, I don't think I would buy this book. Its not something that I would want to read again, however I got a lot out of it, and it gave me a lot to think about. It is a book that everyone should read, however I think borrowing it from the library is a better decision. There are a few confusing parts, and it takes a little time to understand a few things, but overall it all comes together in the end, and really is a good book and gets you thinking."

I'd never heard of Bradbury, but realized as I fought through the first few chapters that I was in over my head. I stuck it out however, and when I was done, my life had changed forever. Since then I have read this book many times, and it is always with a particular fondness because this is the book that taught me to read. To read as more than someone who desires nothing more than to be entrained.That is not to say that Bradbury isn't entertaining. I've always found him to be one of the most successfully entertaining science fiction writers of all time. FAHRENHEIT 451 is on of his best. Conceptually simple (books are outlawed and the world has become a dreary, dystopian place where cheap thrills and wars fought with disease bombs are the norm) but wise and deep in substance, Bradbury successfully weaves characters and plot into a profound statement about the essential nature of human kind and how the best of our writing can, if used (read) properly, even save us from ourselves.There are few accolades that I can give this book that have not been already said more eloquently elsewhere. This is book filled with profound truth, a book that inspires, and a book that illustrates the best and worst of what men are capable of. Ultimately about the hope we have in the sum of human knowledge, few other books will make you treasure the act of reading and the privilege of owning books like this one will."

I figured it out enough to kind of follow the story, but definitely not enough to actually get into the book. This is one of only about 3 books that I have ever read that I did not perfectly understand and enjoy. The basic idea of the plot is that Guy Montag, a fireman in the future, is paid to burn down houses that illegally store books in them. He meets some other characters (such as Clarisse, a 17 year old who lives in his neighborhood) who help him open his eyes to the world that he is being so blind to.

Bradbury's excellent prose allowed some of his novels to escape the ""science fiction ghetto"" and surely this is one book that made the jump over the barbed wire.The plot is simple but shocking; books are dangerous to a trivial and controlling culture--therefore, burn them. Without books, there can be no memory of how things were or should be. Montag is a fireman who's job is, of course, to start fires and create bonfires of contraband books. His wife is absolutely shallow and ""normal""--she watches the daily soaps on TV, which in this futuristic society are full wall-sized plasma screens. She nags Montag to earn more so she can install a fourth screen and surround the room with the escape from reality. Even some part of her, however, senses the bleakness of the world, and witlessly tries to escape in an overdose of drugs.Montag is dedicated in his work, but perhaps his investigative nature leads him into the world of the contraband book-hoarders. What drives a man to leap upon a funeral pyre of his library? A shaken Montag must find out.Bradbury sketches the frightening world of a society with non-readers and non-thinkers, dumbed down by design. What did he see in the 50's that we are just realizing today? He was not only amazingly prescient in his description of wall-sized flatscreen TV, but in the trend to a world where education, reading, and reason are being made extinct, if not downright subversive.

There are more and more ways to read a book without even reading. Television is a big part in why people today do not want to read. Children begin watching TV at a very early age and just lose complete interest in reading period. There have been studies where watching television for a couple of hours each day causes ADD which will effect the amount of reading a person will do.This is an easy read for any type of reader. There is a clearly outlined plot. There is nowhere to get confused or even lost. Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books. Now you might think a fireman burning books is lame but it really just makes this entire novel so much more interesting to read. The people can't even remember the last time a fireman put out a fire! Than Guy Montag's new neighbor clarrise shows him why reading is not bad but good. Clarrise shows him the beauty of reading and all of its positive feedbacks. Of course this is a very dangerous game he is playing for if he would get caught he could be arrested. When Montag finds out that his chief fireman knows he has a stash of books in is house Montags ends up burning his own house down.The Characters in this book are explained to you in a really interesting way. Guy Montag is explained in great detail on both his physical appearance as a fireman and mentally.

With the aid of a mysterious girl, Clarice, who says she is &quot;seventeen and crazy,&quot; fireman Guy Montag chooses to defy society and is forced to run for sanctuary, even as a nuclear Armageddon approaches. Bradbury's love of books is evident in his theme, and his love of language is evident in his linguistic acrobatics.

This book has made it to the top of my &quot;burn this book&quot; list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named &quot;GUY MONTAG&quot;. How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all &quot;offensive&quot; material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the &quot;family&quot; argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"

So, like always, I'll just give my personal insights. In my opinion, what makes a classic a classic is something like this. . .it's pretty obvious that this book, when it was written, takes place in the future. Never do we know exactly when, and never is it actually stated that this book takes place in the future, yet it is. The fact that the fictional plot isn't really far-fetched is spooky, and mabe that's what caused such a stir when this book was causing controversy.Another thing is that a classic can not be defined as just one genre. This book is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. It's not the sci-fi that Asimov presents, where it takes place in space, across planets and galaxies and so on (by the way, I like Asimov alot, I'm not at all saying this type of sci-fi is bad), but with the little details, such as a Mechanical Hound (who was quite intimidating I might add), and the seashell worn by Mildred. It was more science fiction than I expected it to be, yet it was far from just a science fiction novel. It is also mostly a dystopian novel, yet at times it's also a thriller, even a tad of horror, and not to mention some heavy pyschological tendicies. And all of it works beautifully together.This story also does two things that a classic does: it takes a toll, or has a profound effect, on you, and also gets you thinking. From early on, and I mean the very first pages, the mood is dark and gloomy, and already the reader feels dreary. Montag's unhappiness is so realistic, his world so seemingly hopeless. Instantly the reader pities and sympathizes with Montag. His unhappiness, his refusal to just do as he's told like everyone around him does, is so well written as to be completely relatable and realistic. The scene where he watches his wife being ""operated on"" after she overdoses is both intense and horrific.It's pretty amazing that this book was so controversial and so challenged, especially considering the plot. Bradbury fit a whole lot of story into 150 pages here, and whatever he was trying to accomplish, I'd say he was extremely successful. Something Wicked This Way Comes was a good book, a really fun read (one thing I really liked better about fahrenheit 451 is that Bradbury's writing is much more concise) but THIS book is the real deal, and this is what proved to me that Bradbury deserves the praise and accolades he received throughout his lifetime. One of the best books I've read and I certainly recommend you read it."

I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well.

It's exemplification of the way too much censorship can ruin the world makes you a little more aware of censorship everywhere. The book is about Montag, a fireman who starts fires that destroy books. In this futuristic world, Books are not allowed due to the controversy they create. People who do not follow the strict code of staying home and watching TV are persecuted. One day, after a meeting with a girl, Montag begins to realize the true beauty of books. Not a terribly hard book to read, Fahrenheit 451 had a few difficult vocab words and a few chaotic scenes, but mostly kept the plot simple. I would recommend this book to 6th or 7th graders trying to expand their vocabulary, or anyone else who wants a book that makes them think.

The disturbing similarity of this fictional world to the one we actually live in today, makes this a thought-provoking must-read.I must say, however, that I am not a big fan of the writing style. Points are driven home without much subtlety. It even sounds a little preachy in places. This style actually takes away from the importance of the message for me, much the same way that an over-eager preacher can sometimes diminish the impact of an important sermon. Even the imagery of book-burning, though very provocative, ultimately makes the world of Fahrenheit 451 seem more un-real and distant from ours than it actually is.The other problem is that the book never gets past the central premise to explore questions like why or how such a world might come to pass in any real detail. This is probably because it was originally written as a short novella. However, in this case, I would have liked to see a sequel!In the end, this is the kind of book that every thinking person should read for themselves, so read it and make up your own mind! :)"

With the use of his imagery, you see his world in a different perspective. The different dramatic pauses throughout the story, give it character and leave you with the feeling of tension and anxiety, not knowing whats coming next.

It has great discriptions even if they are abstract and also a great development of characters within an action plot. I would have to say that my favorite character in the entire book was Clarisse. She seemed so soft, so fresh, so new, and so likeable, especially compared with some of the other characters in the book. She was so full of life and the joys she could find in it that I really enjoyed her character and I was very sad when she dies. This book always kept me interested with its implications and its deep meanings and because of that it always kept me thinking. I would have to stop for a few minutes to think about what I had just read but that is a good thing and it made me feel like I became more familiar with the book becuase of it.

653,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,A1VF0102Z9VITO,Joseph M. Reninger,0/0,5.0,1343606400,"Thoughtful, Lyrical Sci Fi Masterpiece","This is the fourth time I've read this book, though the first time in over 15 years. It's a science fiction classic about firemen who burn books in a not too distant and far too dystopian future. Bradbury is a great storyteller and weaves an amazingly lyrical narrative. It first grabbed me in childhood as an exciting adventure with a very vivid portrayal of the life of Guy Montag, fireman turned rebel.One of the delightful things I discovered in this re-reading was the idea of the proper relationship to books. The government represented by the firemen sees books as a hazard that causes both inequality (reading books makes people think they're better than others) and rancor (people may disapprove of how they (as minorities) are depicted in books). The citizens have fallen away from reading and are constantly plugged in to their living rooms, which are now nothing other than parlors with wall-sized TVs on every wall. Montag's wife wants them to buy a fourth wall TV to complete the room. If she isn't watching TV, she's listening to audio programs on little seashell devices in her ears. Books don't even register as reality for her; when Montag brings them into the house she is filled with horror at what they mean. Not that they contain horrible ideas, but that their house will be burned down if they are discovered. It's as if the government had already won their point.On the other hand, Montag learns to appreciate books, first by meeting Clarisse. She's the seventeen-year old neighbor with the funny family (her uncle was once arrested for driving too slowly at 40 miles an hour). She is interested in nature and people. She has real conversations with Montag about things that matter. She is a catalyst for Montag to explore the forbidden fruit he has been roasting for so long.Like any amateur, he makes a bit of a mess in how he handles things. He tries to convince his wife's friends that they should listen to books but they all recoil in horror. He tries to play cat-and-mouse with his boss at the firehouse but he is not up to the challenge. He eventually has to flee for his life.He falls in with a group of people who have been memorizing books, to preserve them for the time when the culture is ready. Interestingly, they constantly tell themselves that they are not more important or better than others for what they are doing. They are keeping a trust for civilization. In one scene, Montag is talking to Faber, a former professor who has been keeping a low profile though is in touch with the book people. Faber explains the difference between four-wall TVs and books:.""..you can't argue with the four-wall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real.' It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'""[Montag:]""Only the 'family' is 'people.'""""I beg pardon?""""My wife says books aren't 'real.'""""Thanks God for that. You can shut them, say, 'Hold on a moment.' You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlor? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and skepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full color, three dimensions, and being in and part of those incredible parlors.""The difference is between what's engaging and what's overwhelming. Books are a help in understanding reality, not a substitute for it or a way to tune reality out (though certainly some have used books that way). They help the reader to understand other people, other times, other places. But they don't force you to agree with them. The proper attitude toward books is not one of hostility or fear or submission. It's of wonder and learning and growing.The book is definitely worth reading and worth re-reading. Bradbury's death a few months ago really is a great loss.Hear some better commentary on A Good Story is Hard to Find, which is what inspired me to re-read the book. And now I am finally starting Jane Eyre, which they discussed quite a while ago."
654,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,,,7/7,5.0,1044230400,The Temperature At Which Books Burn,"I give Fahrenheit 451 five stars because it is very interesting and pulls the reader into the life of Guy Montag, the main character and narrator. Ray Bradbury uses great imagery in this book so that the reader can picture exactly what Montag sees. Another thing that makes this book so great are the ideas that we take for granted such as thinking. In this book there are very few people who can think for themselves. It also makes you question things like, if there were no book would people still be able to think for on there own? This is a really great book.In this book you will read about a society that is very different from our own. This society takes place in the future. All the houses there are fire proof making firemen obsolete for their old job. There the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Instead of using water they now use kerosene. Their job is to burn books and the houses they are in as soon as they are found. They follow strict rules which are1. Answer the alarm swiftly, 2. Start the fire swiftly, 3. Burn everything, 4. Report back to firehouse immediately, and 5. Stand alert for other alarms. According to them the first firehouse was built in 1790 to burn books. The first fireman was Benjamin Franklin. All books are banned from everyone. Being caught with a book is a punishable offense.This was Montag's job. He never questioned why he burned them or anything else in his life. Until he meet a girl named Clarisse McClellan who helped him start to think for himself. She asked him questions he never thought of before such as if he was happy and she pointed things out that he never noticed like how the billboards got longer because the cars got faster. All these new realizations helped Montag open his mind to start thinking and opened his eyes to what the government was doing.Clarisse spends her days outside exploring her environment and thinking about how strange the world is. She does not go to school because people think of her as anti-social when she just has a different idea of what being social is. Montag sees her doing some of the most peculiar things such as shaking a walnut tree or knitting a blue sweater. He saw her outside one day in the rain and she explained that she loved the way the rain tasted. Montag had never thought about how rain tasted and that day on the way to work he tilted his head back and opened his mouth to taste the rain. This was not the only time she told Montag something that got him thinking. One morning when they were talking and she told him she thinks dry leaves smell like cinnamon. Her odd revelations to him helped him think more and more.Montag starts to question all the people around him but mostly his wife, Mildred. She does nothing all day except watch her three-wall TV. He realizes he does not truly love her because he does not really know her at all. One night Mildred has two friends over to watch the three-wall TV. Montag listens to there conversation. They were talking about the up coming war and one woman said that her husband is in the army. She talked about how her husband might die but its okay because it's the third marriage for both of them and she won't have ant trouble getting over it. This shows Montag that people are incapable of feeling also. They can't think or feel they just live life and care only of themselves.Another person that helps Montag to start to think and question authority was an old professor called Faber. Montag had met Faber in a park a long time ago and Montag decides to call and then visit him. Faber tells him of a time when people read books and were not afraid of being caught with them. Faber lost his job as a professor when one year he came back to teach and only one student had signed up for the coarse. Faber thinks of himself as a coward because he loves book and believes that they should not be banned but he does not do anything to stop it. He was there when books were being banned and he said nothing because he was afraid. But Faber's compassion and wisdom give Montag courage. Faber stays in his house all the time and creates new inventions. One invention is a little speaker you put in your ear so you can talk to someone. Montag and Faber use this to there advantage.These characters help Montag a lot through out the book. If it were not for them Montag would have never started to realize what he has to do. He must change the society in some way but how? He is only one man. It all starts when he confronts his fire chief, Beatty. But to find out what happens read Fahrenheit 451. This book is a page-turner and you won't want to put it down."

It is about a future with no books or free thoughts and how humanity has been outstripped by our technology. The books plot and teachings are very important now since our technologies and inventions are being created and upgraded at amazing speeds. The book is also very well-written, with great comparisons and a defining language. The ending, however, is unfulfilling, especially after the incredible suspense the book builds up. On the other hand, a person with other tastes might view this book as a waste of time and money. This is not a book for everyone and the plot and writing might seem just as atrocious as it is excellent to almost anybody. Though by no means a must-read, this book is a source of insight on our ever changing world."

A short while into the story it becomes apparent that Montag already has a certain unease about his job, when he meets a new neighbor of his, Clarisse McClellan, who makes him realize the discomfort he's been feeling. He and the other people around him, including his boss, the Fire Chief, become doubtful of his devotion to his job. This book follows Montag on his journey as he discovers the impotance of literature in a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited.The characters are for the most part non-charismatic and without enthusiasm, with the exception of Clarisse who, having served her purpose, dies within the first few pages. It's a shame, but it is balanced out by the introduction of an old professor named Faber. Both these characters act as guides for Montag as he becomes self-aware and abandons his ignorance.This is the first book in a long time that has made me really think, about what the book means, about what the future will look like, about a life without books. It is an extraordinary piece of writing about a repressive society caught up in its own rules and ideas. Reading through it and hearing as the Chief describes to Montag the history, the process of how slowly, books went from being solely for intellectuals, to being superfluous and completely replaced by television, and finally to being illegal, hits very close to home. While the situations in this books are very extreme, it brings out ideas of this two-dimensional world that doesn't seem so far away."

These reviewers aren't aware of the situations that exist in certain theocracies around the world. Afghanistan under the Taliban outlawed television and women were not allowed to read or educate themselves. In several Middle East countries, merely speaking up against the government makes you a target.Bradbury looked at different phenomena in our society- the desire to not offend anyone, the dumbing-down of a society in love with television, etc., and simply extrapolated these until he reached an end very similar to the conditions that existed under the Taliban.Part of the point of science fiction is to be far-fetched, but good science fiction uses those far-fetched ideas to warn us of the dangers of the present, in this case the dangers of censorship, of political correctness, of television, and anyone who thinks those dangers are not real, that this book doesn't have relevant warnings, hasn't studied the real world enough.Everyone should read this book. It's an entertaining and easy read but also has a lot of idealogical depth behind it for those who are willing to think and read at the same time.

In it, he addressed some of the feedback he has received over the years about this book. He also stated, in no uncertain terms, exactly his views on censoring of books and even of opinions.I REALLY enjoyed this book and some of the conversations it has sparked with my husband and friends about the subject matter.

Bradbury takes an ugly stick and beats the present day American philosophy down with it. We are a society based on instant gratification. Our slogan is &quot;Right here, Right now. It's your Right!&quot; (How many magazines about fashion, cars, and the ever expanding number of ways to cook chicken can we read before our curiousity is deadened?). This is the type of thinking that Bradbury criticized. What especially frightened me was the concept of MAKING everyone equal. Paradoxally, this is the dumbing down of America, so that no one could be made to feel dumb. It is in settling for society's values without critical judgement that we give up our freedom. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for putting it much more eloquently and forcefully than I ever could. Now everyone out there reading this ... BUY the book, READ the book, then tell me if you aren't outraged at the lack of neuron firings in the heads of our society."

The book is set in the future, but we don't know when. We learn that Montag has a stash of books that he has been stealing from houses he had burned that are hidden in his air-conditioning vent. Beatty, his fire chief, tells him he has one day to decide if books are any good then bring the book to work to be burned. Montag had met a retired English professor named Faber at a park a year ago. He reads poetry to Mildred and two of her friends; they get scared and go home. Montag goes to work and hands over one of his books, then the alarm sounds, when they get to the house they realize that it is Montag's house. His wife and her friends had called in the report. Beatty forces him to burn down his own house then places him under arrest, then he turns the flame-thrower on Beatty and knocks down the other firemen. The Mechanical Hound that Beatty had set against Montag injects some anesthetic into his leg. He walks off the numbness and goes to Faber's house. Faber gives Montag some of his clothes and tells him to run out of the city. He follows an abandoned railroad until he finds a group of ""Book People"" that have memorized the great works of literature and philosophy.In my opinion, Fahrenheit 451 is hard to understand and enjoy if you don't like futuristic fiction. The plot seemed like it happened too quickly and it doesn't seem realistic. This would probably never happen because people enjoy books too much. The characters don't seem disturbed about the fact that books aren't part of their lives. All they do is sit in their ""parlors"" watching TV on huge screens. This book is made more for people that are interested in futuristic novels and censorship. The characters are only used to not having books as a part of their lives, the government controled everything that was printed until society decided that they didn't want books anymore, as to not offend anyone. The people of this society don't think freely or spend time by themselves."

The main character, Guy Montag is a fireman of the future--paid to set books ablaze. In the beginning, he finds comfort in this. Then he begins to question authority and the sensless laws set forth by a faceless government. From beginning to end, this story is a thrill ride, cover to cover. Mr. Bradbury has you guessing. His characters are so unique, and at the same time, truly everyday people. This book is truly enjoyable. Younger readers will not get the symbolism; however, older readers will see just how close we probably are to this virtual insanity of lies and deception. In the end I was left wondering, &quot;Who saw that books were so harmful?&quot; Was it one man or the whole nation, slowly evolving from our current lawsuit happy world, to this insane world of deception? I just have to wonder. I would recommend this to teachers. For the student's sake, it is a fairly short story but there is a lot that can be done with it.

In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"

Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."

When he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan who changes everything and gives him a new point of view of the world.What I like most about this book was the setting and the time, the future makes you wonder about what you're living in now and what might happen in the future. What I didn't like about the book was that it was a little hard and confusing at times for my age reading.My favorite charater in this book was Clarisse McCellan because she has such a different mind than everyone else and sees things in different perspectives. A paragraph that meant something to me was on page 37 and said ""Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim light, a page flung open and it was like a snow feather, the words delicately painted thereon."" It meant something to me beacause all of these books around him makes him wonder about his job, life, and Clarisse and what she had said.I would tell someone about this book that it is great but to read it at a good reading level. So it's not too hard or confusing to read. The only question I have after reading this is, in some ways is Beatty the villan of Station 451?

Censorship is the way of life in the science fiction world of Fahrenheit 451. Conforming with government, destroying individuality, and asking no questions are the rules of Guy Montag's world. Set in the twenty-first century, Ray Bradbury's novel tells the tale of the fireman who begins to question the rights and wrongs of his life. In this world books promote thinking and wondering and acting. Compliance is necessary for the government to ignore its people and watch over its ""thirty-second"" wars. The government wants assimilation and ignorance of differences. So modern technology produces television that is interactive and family rooms are replaced with television parlors - four walls of larger than life TV screens. The firemen hunt out owners of books and burn them, their homes and their books to the ground. ""It was a pleasure to burn,"" is the opening line of the story. In the beginning burning books is a source of joy, an excitement programmed into Montag by his world. Then he meets a girl whose family raised her with an encouragement of challenging what she is told. Montag is amazed, almost scared of the idea of questioning life. She begins to question him too. ""'Do you ever read any of the books you burn?' `Is it true that long ago firemen put out fires instead of going to start them?' and the worst of all, `Are you happy?'"" And there begins Montag's conflict with the government and with himself. When he reads a line of a book he realizes that there is no turning back. He can't be who he was before. And maybe he doesn't want to be. The book is set up as a narrative of one man's experience in trying to rebel against a world that has almost complete control. It is written partly as a typical novel and partly as a sequence of Montag's thoughts. The plot is hard to follow in places and often confusing but the idea behind the story is important enough to make reading the book worthwhile. Bradbury attempts to warn us of what the future may hold that we might prevent the beginning of a world of tyranny. He tells us to remember and cherish the attributes that make us who we are. He teaches us to be an individual and challenge the world around us. Although I did not enjoy the novel, because of the confusion, its message is very important if I want a world where what I think and say is important. A world in where I am a person with rights and opinions that are as valued as any other person's. I do want that world."

677,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,,,1/6,4.0,939340800,Good book,"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was ""programed"" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book. This is why I would reccomend it to a friend."

It was a world where people didn't just sit and talk, and have educated conversations, there was actually very little exchange between people. Its quite on the contrary, it's a world where TV's lined whole walls, and if you pay extra they can even say your name! The fireman lived in firehouses, but had robotic dogs that were trained to attack and kill! The story is about a fireman, Guy Montage, who meets a young girl who tells him how life used to be, and about what can be found in books. Guy then steals books and reads them. In reading these books he has discovers the truth, he discovers the way life was and should be, he reads about philosophy and poetry, even the bible. His wife rats him out to the fireman and they come to burn down his house to destroy all the books kept inside. He then becomes a criminal running from everyone. His goal is to set up fireman across the world by planting books in their homes, therefore destroying all firemen and hopefully returning the world to the way it used to be like in the young girls stories.This was a very exciting book, and very colorful. It painted a very beautiful painting in my head and described things so thoroughly that I believed that a world like that might possibly exists somewhere out there."

Oliveira""",4/4,5.0,1068249600,Great book from a good writer,"At some point, Ray Bradbury states in his novel `Fahrenheit 451': `The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.The present edition is followed by an `Afterword' and a `Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because `Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched."

I don't really think this is the case. 451 is a book about what books should be about. Books should inspire us to think, to challenge ourselves. The best poetry should make us cry (so, too, should the worst but for other reasons.) Books should make us question our society and it's assumed intrinsic goodness.John Cheever said, in his Pulitzer acceptance speech, that books, maybe, could prevent nuclear war. Bradbury, too, makes this point in the speeches of the wandering academics Montag meets at the end of 451.If you're interested in reading a book with a purpose, with a meaning -- a book which strives to show us where we could go and the bad we could do -- read 451 and let yourself question the status quo."

So why is Bradbury's book a classic? The key is his superior writing skills and offbeat social subversion. In Bradbury's world, free speech has not been suppressed through a fascist exercise in social control and forced conformity, as in Huxley's similar ""Brave New World."" Instead, in this book free speech has been eliminated indirectly through what would now be called rampant political correctness. Every single piece of free speech might be offensive to someone somewhere, so all books and entertainment are eliminated so the masses can waste away in feel-good conformity. Ignorance is bliss in this world. This is a groundbreaking concept for a book written way back in the 50's. Bradbury must have been terrified by the PC hordes that broke out 30 or 40 years later. The one major problem with this book is the characters. The protagonist Montag is ultimately narrow and undefined, even though most of the story concerns his inner struggles. The other main characters - Beatty, Faber, and Granger - exist only as longwinded speechifiers for Bradbury's ideas. But the book is saved by the real sense of creeping dread and social agony lurking in the background, all highlighted by Bradbury's intriguing prose and curveball plot techniques.Be sure to read an edition of this book published after around 1980. Prior to that, editors had abridged the book without Bradbury's consent, removing some troubling passages for the sake of helpless schoolkids (or more likely, their holier-than-thou educators). This is the ultimate irony - censorship of a book about censorship! Be on the lookout for an edition containing Bradbury's ""Coda"" (or epilogue) - a blistering indictment of this issue in which Bradbury essentially tells all opponents to kiss his you-know-what, in a quite scathing way."

People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble.

Montag, the main character in this book is a firefighter, but he is not your average firefighter. Firemen now start fires instead of putting them out; and they fuel the fires by burning books.This book has a very futuristic setting to it. People watch television on screens that are as big as the walls because books have been outlawed because the higher authorities were becoming offended by what was said in them. Therefore, soon it was impossible to write something without offending a person, which made literature dull and all the same. The world is going through very harsh times, there have already been a couple of wars since 1990.Montag is fed up with life until he runs into an open minded younger girl named Clarisse. She is different from most people at the time with a passion for nature and a love for other people. After Clarisse dies, Montag begins to turn to books for answers as to why they are being burned. Montags firechief Beatty finds out and gives Montag 24 hours to read as much as he wants. Montag will later find out that his wife betrays him because she is disgusted that he is reading and leaves him. Beatty orders Montag to burn his own house then places Montag under arrest only before Montag turns and burns Beatty alive.Montag then has to escape the law from a mechanical hound that is out to get him. In the end, Montag joins up with a group of ""book people"" that have memorized great literary pieces and are basically outlaws on the run. He stays with them and helps to rebuild society.When i got done reading this book i was very surprised to think that this is the way society is slowly becoming. Many more things are being censored now for fear of being chastized then in previous times. Kids nowadays are also much lazier and much less reading is being done by newer generations.

An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."

Not so much his work, but him. His quasi-luddite persona that distrusts ATMs but dreams of flying cars, his palpable (and occasionally justified) pretentiousness that allowed him to transcend pulp sci-fi in the 50s while still pandering to that crowd. That out of the way...Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for a high school sophomore/junior about the dangers of anti-intellectualism and censorship. It is a bracing look at what such policy might lead to. It's fairly well-reasoned and it remains gripping throughout. On the other hand, however, it lacks the sort of over-arching philosophy that can be found in other dystopias. Although it's a great way to get into the subgenre, it's by no means the only or best word upon the subject. It happens to be oversimplified and narrow in focus.It is also, though, excessively didactic. There's very little nuance here, and it's none too subtle about getting across its message. It doesn't quite match up to 1984 and Brave New World, both of which ponder higher philosophical questions and give us plausible scenarios in which the human spirit is broken. In fact, 1984 is now only really significant in its portrait of humanity, since the state it depicts is no longer achievable (I guess Orwell never thought that it would be companies and individuals and not the government who would develop computer technology). Brave New World is the most prophetic of all, largely because it depicts the final showdown of the human spirit and the wheels of society not as a bang, but a whimper, with people so preoccupied with sex and drugs that they just push out thoughts when they come.In fact, Fahrenheit 451 is not all that prophetic. As a warning sign, sure, it retains currency, but it was written before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement, in Eisenhower's America, where paranoia over Red invasion and Soviet spies like the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss made such private invasion seem inevitable in the name of preserving liberty. In fact, restrictions on expression have been almost infinitely eased since 1954. The Supreme Court under Earl Warren began to strike down state obscenity laws prohibiting mostly porn, but also avant-garde films, to the point now where they're all gone. I'm not about to argue that the arts now are more vital and important than they ever have been, but it helps when the most popular show on TV is The Sopranos when it used to be All in the Family. Now, much more than ever, we live in a society where the minority is free to say what they wish, thanks to the Internet, the great equalizer. That these voices don't all make it into the mainstream is the fault of the media corporations and the anti-intellectual public, not moral queasiness by the majority. In fact, looking at the 50's, with the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for refusing to answer questions about Communists, where being a Communist and speaking out against the government (in some circumstances) were crimes, and Joe McCarthy decrying such people as Arthur Miller and Defense Secretary George C. Marshall as Communists, it is difficult to argue that censorship has worsened. In every measureable respect, things have gotten much better. That's not to say that tomorrow it might go the other way, but it hasn't and it probably won't.In spite of the recent Ray Bradbury renaissance, we need to put all of his work into context. The outwardly-happy-inwardly-freaked-out 1950s led to many great artistic works, like On The Waterfront and film noir, as well as great popular works, like The Twilight Zone, all of which had underneath them the peculiar paranoia of the time. Fahrenheit 451 is no different, and I would implore you to read it and take this into account. It is highly readable, but let's be honest about its impact and accuracy as prediction."
689,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,A33OOFRJ2JC00B,Neil Chafin,1/1,5.0,1158796800,read me,"Fahrenheit 451 is a read rich with a delicious story and social commentary. Guy Montag lives in a world made ironic because of the stark contrast to the way we wish our society was today. Firemen don't keep people safe from fires, they bust into houses starting fires. Scholars and professors live on the outside of society because of their love for books, philosophy, and sociology where in our world professors are on the inside and the ignorant majority are on the outside because of their lack of interest for the said disciplines.Literature is correctly portrayed by the leaders of Montag's twisted Earth as a tool that helps people keep in touch with their government and the reality of the world in which they live. This realization by the government lead to a life in which people are encouraged to live `within' the television. Not literally within the television, but completely enamored by a world of entertainment, visual images, and trivial information symbolized by the television. I have a feeling this society isn't hooked to the Discovery Channel.Some go as far as to suggest that our world today is headed towards being like the world of Fahrenheit 451. The explosion of television, fashion, cinema, video games, and the internet certainly suggest that our society is very much interested in entertainment, and probably at the expense of intuitive thought. However entertainment is not a crime, as we all enjoy being entertained. The publishing business is thriving, and so are newspapers, blogs, and other sources of text. It will be interesting to see how far our Earth will progress towards the world of Fahrenheit 451."

Now that I have, I can see why it's a classic and can see why it will always remain one and remain relevant. This was a very powerful book. Picture a world engaged in war, a world full of censorship, a world where there is no speed limit, a world where people do not engage with each other, but rather engage with the walls. This is the world that Ray Bradbury has created in Fahrenheit 451.451 is the number that the firemen wear on their uniforms. The jobs of the firemen are not to put out fires, but rather, start them. Books are banned in Bradbury's world. Books are seen as not real, silly, impersonal, influential, propaganda and will not be tolerated by the government. So it is that the job of the firemen is to burn every book in existence and to imprison the owner of the books. Quite a scary thing. One of the firemen, Montag (the central character) has kept some books of his own. Upon reading them, he finds that books should exist, and you can see the dilemma that this could cause. That's all I'll say so as not to ruin the story for those who have never read this.This is also my first Bradbury work, and I'm very happy that I've finally discovered him. He is Orson Scott Card's favorite author, so I figured he had to be a pretty damn good writer...and he is! I look forward to reading more of his work. I have Something Wicked This Way Comes sitting on my shelf, so that'll be the next Bradbury. I also have a short story by the name of The Homecoming illustrated by Dave McKean.It's very ironic that this book has been banned seeing as the book is about books being banned and censorship. My thoughts on why it may be banned is because of Montag's challenge of authority. This is shown as a good thing in this book and he is the hero, and it's generally not well taken in our society when one goes up against the government or any form of authority. I think it's ridiculous to ban this book though. This book speaks volumes about power in the wrong hands, ignorance, and many other themes that I could go on forever about. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful book and although it has been banned in some places, I'm glad to see that it is required reading in so many other places."

It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"

The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;.

Although it is a fictional, futuristic novel, the sense that the senerio could happen is chilling to a society that prides itself on freedom of speech and equal liberties.I like Bradbury's writing style also. At first I had little faith that this book could keep my interest, but not too far into reading I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The language kept you hanging onto every word.

Fireman Guy Montag knew the pleasure and psychological rush he experienced while burning books; it was privilege to ride the Dragon, to bear the Salamander emblem on his clothing. He delighted in destroying remnants of a previous era, when people foolishly believed and reacted to the printed word. Seeking ever more speed, noise and violence to substitute for lack of intellectual and emotional stimulus, this culture has become shallow, enjoying superficial interactions and slavish obedience to mass mentality. This was a disposable society, where the government manipulated war and city officials doctored the news--to keep an audience or merely save face.But Montag gradually realizes his own dis-ease, as doubts creep into his mind; he begins to stash forbidden books in a secret chache, and to seriously consider the ideas of the school girl next door, whose family has been watched and labeled as antisocial for years. It is very dangerous for an individual to question or defy the prescribed pattern for Happiness, as dictated by mass media techniques. Was there some secret--vital to mankind's happiness and peace of mind--hidden within those scorned and banned books? Could one man save civilization from its own misgudied zeal? This gripping tale (under 150 pages) depicts a society gone amuck; RB provides many serious themes for thoughtful readers of all ages to digest.The 1968 film, though inevitably different from the original, is also a powerful statement. I saw it as a student in Italy.

The main idea of the story is that censorship (especially concerning books) is very dangerous and damaging to society. Whether you know it or not, books (especially the classics) are everywhere. From nursery rhymes to mythological stories, they play an important part in our daily lives. They are referenced in tv shows, movies, and in our vernacular. Think of Shakespeare. How many times do we see the Romeo and Juliet story whether it be in movies or music, etc. Or Homer's Odyssey? Or the Bible? If we were to lose these gems, our lives lose that important element. You don't have to be a reader to not feel the magnitude of losing our greatest stories. What I got out of the book also was Mr. Bradbury seemed to be warning the reader that if society doesn't open their eyes and take notice of important issues, the rug is going to be pulled out from under us. If we keep burying our heads in the sand and hiding behind celebrity rags, video games, and sporting events, we'll lose touch with the world around us and become victims of something bigger. He's not saying that fun can't be had, but if our lives are simply filled with sloth and fluff, we are going to be no better than a lemming. It's our duty to educate ourselves in order to prevent things like censorship or war from happening. A very good read, indeed."
713,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""",4/4,5.0,1131235200,"24th Century version of RIF: ""Reading is Flammable""","Ray Bradbury's 1953 phantasmagoric blockbuster ""Fahrenheit 451"", written at the height of the fabulist's authorial powers, is a tale of a world gone mad, a topsy-turvy America in which black leather-clad firemen race laughing on their steely Salamanders on midnight alarms, not to quench fires but to start them.The firemen of the nightmare world of ""Fahrenheit 451"", of which the novel's hero Guy Montag is a dedicated one, comprise an army turned against an enemy far more insidious than Flame: they mobilize against ideas, and turn their napalm hoses on the feeble paper on which those subversive ideas are printed, and on the vulnerable binding in which the paper is housed.When I first read ""Fahrenheit 451"" nearly two decades ago, I felt beaten down, nauseated and fatigued. I believed then, and believe now, that it was the most scarily bleak and mercilessly depressing book I had ever read. Even then, I felt the cushion between Bradbury's 24th century nightmare and what we call modern reality was thin and worn.Bradbury gave us until the 24th century to submerge ourselves in the dark, sedated, media-slaked night of ""Fahrenheit 451."" Looking around me, I have come to the conclusion that Bradbury was a pretty optimstic guy.Like Orwell's ""1984"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"", Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" is a dystopian vision, a glimpse into a future America that is frighteningly familiar and yet horribly wrong. It is a technologically advanced, subtle, sophisticated world, full of high-definition television screens that take up an entire wall and beam 24 hour programming to a vacant and eager television audience, 24-hour Reality programming that serves up a TV ""Family"" more engaging, more lifelike, more agreeable, than their own.This is a world where bored, vacuous housewives exchange barbs on the latest presidential contenders laced with observations on which candidate is the most handsome, and which has the most noticeable (to the Television Audience, naturally) facial bunion or boil. It is a world of 'seashells', tiny earphones designed to nest in the inner ear and breathe a sussurus of music into the mind of a medicated listener.Like his English counterparts Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury has served up a soft tyrannical state manned, not by the zealous, but by zombies. It is a world ruled by the media-addicted, the apathetic, the listless, the medicated, the overdosed, the sleeping. Books have been banned, and consigned to the Flame, not because of a despotic regime, but by the common, courteous consensus of a modern democracy desperately eager not to give offense to anyone.Sound familiar?Much like ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" works because it drills down on an unlikely protagonist. Guy Montag, at least when we meet him, sincerely loves his job. His fellow firemen are not zealots or fascists, but simply pragmatic working men who enjoy what they do. There are unpleasant aspects to the work, naturally---among them the incineration of an old eccentric woman who prefer to die with her beloved books---but like most of ""Fahrenheit 451""'s society, Montag prefers not to think about it. Take a pill, or better still take two---and don't call me in the morning. For Montag, truly, it is a 'pleasure to burn'.Like most revolutionaries, though, Guy Montag is simmering from within; dissatisifed with his wife, whose stomach must be pumped on the very evening he returns from the euphoria of the Burn; dissatisifed with the apathetic society in which he lives; dissatisfied with a job which fails to give expression to the rebel soul that burns within, that impels him to challenge his wife's brazen, flippant friends.There are three catalysts that propel Montag to rebellion: the girl Clarisse, whom he befriends; the immolation of the old woman at the Fire; and his own clandestine book collection.""Fahrenheit 451"" succeeds as both jeremiad and prophecy, true, but it also engages because Bradbury is a literary master: his spare, mechanical narrative of Montag's wife having her stomach pumped by two callous, dirty, jocular technicians practically breathes pure horror, and is one of the most soul-deadening passages I have ever read.But ""451"" also succeeds because it is a mirror of our own increasingly apathetic, violent, media-saturated world: is it so hard to see ourselves in Montag's trackless, cookie-cutter suburban landscape where bookish teenage girls are run down beneath the wheels of speeding pranksters, themselves bored and looking for the cheap thrill of ultra-violence? Is it so hard to see ourselves in the avidity of the Television Audience, watching the panicked, doomed, frantic rictus face of the condemned man stalked by the mechanical Hound, the images of his death broadcast back by the electronic antennaes on the monster's back? Isn't that merely COPS or ""Survivor"" with a bite?I've seen the Future, and it works. Because it is our world I see, our world upon us---for that reason, ""Fahrenheit 451"" is the most terrifying book I have ever read.JSG"

So begins, with this absolutely perfect opening line, Ray Bradbury's celebrated exposition of the dangers of censorship. Everybody knows that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about book-burning, but this story goes much deeper than those not having read it may suspect. Its message truly does become even more germane and prophetic with every passing day. The skeleton of the plot is rather basic, really. Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to burn books and the houses in which these dangerous manifestations of inane scribbling reside - usually hidden. No one even remembers a time when firemen actually put out fires. We join Guy's life as he enters into a cusp of uncertainty. He has dared to pilfer a book here and there and stash them in his house, a most dangerous crime indeed. He soon meets a free-spirited teenager who breathes life into his state of uncertainty and opens his mind to brand new thoughts and possibilities. When she makes him admit that he is not happy, his life is changed forever. He can't take the lack of substance all around him, the wife who thinks of nothing but ""the family"" (a type of interactive programming that dominates the living room), the impending war which everyone essentially ignores. He knows there must be something else in life, and he comes to believe that the enlightenment he is after must surely be contained in books. Montag's conversations with his Fire Chief on this subject are quite astounding and revealing, and between this and Montag's friendship with an old former professor, we learn how Montag's world came to be this way.The government did not simply ban books overnight. Censorship started slowly and at low levels. Some minority group complained about this - deleted; another group complained about that - gone; these fellows over here object to so-and-so - zip. So many little pieces of books were removed that, over time, the very essence of books was destroyed. While the government has now come to insist that reading books is a crime, the horrible truth of the matter is that the society itself, in its fractious ways, is the party responsible for this tragic state of affairs. Can there be a more timely topic for our own time? We continually see history books being rewritten, ""objectionable"" words, phrases, and (horror of horrors) ideas removed from novels and poems so that no one can possibly be offended by anything under the sun. Censorship is a cancer on society, and the world needs visionaries such as Ray Bradbury to forcefully draw attention to the cold hard facts that a majority of the population seems to ignore or fails to acknowledge. Once the true meaning has been chopped out of the books lining our shelves, it will be too late to reverse the momentum without the aid of some kind of miracle.

In this futuristic setting, nobody seems to be concerned with anything but their own happiness. These people spend majority of their time on frivolous things like fast cars, large televisions, and a type of ear-piece radio. All of the books in the city are to be burned because they create conflicting views amongst the people, ultimately resulting in fighting and unhappiness. Majority of the people are unable to form their own independent thoughts, as the schools are even changed in a way that students only learn facts and not problem solving, logic, reason, or other philosophical subjects. The main character, Montag, is a firefighter that has always done his job (burning books) without questioning. However, after a strange series of events, he slowly begins to develop his own thoughts, and starts questioning the society he lives in."

Our Hero, who sneaked some books and has been secretly reading them, shows us just why the faceless Authority burns all books at Fahrenheit 451. The future has a strong emphasis on interactive television (hey, it covers the four living room walls), and literacy seems to be at the bottom of the heap. Dossiers are kept on all individuals who show an intellectual spark. Such individuals are swatted out of existence, though there seems to be no shortage of those willing to covertly buck the Authority. Plenty of backstabbing neighbors lead to the climax of the novel.With the emphasis today on television and computer skills, and less emphasis on the basic reading skills (just look at reading scores), one can imagine our future, just 4 generations from now, subtly turning into the extremist future world of Fahrenheit 451. A recommended read for any wishing to extol the virtues of more reading and less television; for those wanting a glimpse of a future where technology has suppressed the creative spark; and for those wishing to learn exactly what censorship does to a society."

Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."

724,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,ARUE2BHA15ID5,"Twilightdreamlover ""Mariangeles""",2/3,5.0,1281312000,"Brilliant, depressing, electrifying, profound!!","Ray Bradbury's books make for immediate, mesmerizing, entirely compulsive reading. His prose is electrifying in its use of poetic metaphor and dramatic syntax. The reader is instantly plunged into an alien culture, or a terrifying future, and is not really released even after the last page is turned.I had been postponing reading this novel for years. I am, after all, a confirmed bibliophile. Reading a novel with a plot involving the burning of books would, I kept telling myself, be too traumatic for me.I finally decided to wade in.Need I say that I only put the book down when I absolutely had to, when reality intruded? The novel carried me along on its relentless wave of narrative. Of course, I tried not to picture the books burning as I read, but Bradbury wouldn't let me. Not when he was describing them as living creatures, dying, their pigeon wings flapping.... The fact that I managed to endure this at all is a real tribute to the greatness of his writing.The characters are indelibly imprinted on my brain. The most compelling, of course, is the protagonist, Montag. Equally compelling are Faber, who is obviously Montag's alter ego, and the numinous Clarisse. She is the one who first awakens Montag to the futility of denying his own soul, the stirrings of thought and penetrating questions that reading invariably arouses. The most tragic character is Beatty, who struggles hard against his love of books, in his work as chief fireman. This struggle culminates in a final, ironic conflagration. Montag's wife, Mildred, is to be pitied, since she is unable to acknowledge her emptiness, her consuming loneliness. She pushes away the power and beauty to be found in books. She refuses to come out of denial, preferring `the family', a banal cast of characters she endlessly watches on the living room `wall-to-wall TV', in order to anesthetize the deepest longings of her soul.As I read, I became aware of a deeper sense of discomfort, underneath that elicited by the burning of books. Due to my own life experiences, I, along with this disturbed society, had been unconsciously longing for a world in which no one would ever get his or her feelings hurt - a world where everyone's rights would be respected, especially those of minorities.Bradbury gave me a sobering look at such a world, and it was absolutely terrifying. It was ""American Idol"" gone wild, a world in which people no longer thought, felt, or even communicated on a soul level with other human beings. Instead, they spent all their time being `happy', through mindless, ongoing entertainment.I realized that I didn't want to live in such a world; it would mean the total annihilation of what makes us most deeply human - the ability to dream, to wonder, to ponder the deep truths of life.Books and the questions they raise are incompatible with living in a world where nobody would offend anyone else. Books disturb, probe, anger and challenge. Books are flawed at times, due to their authors' all-too-human penchant for furthering their own pet theories, however twisted they might seem to a reader. Books can make us squirm, for they can force us to face the unwanted realities we try to bury.There is still a part of me that thinks that books such as ""Mein Kampf"" should be burned, or at least, allowed to expire by going, and staying, out of print. The Marquis de Sade also comes to mind as an author of books with a markedly offensive subject matter. Then there's Anais Nin. One of her books chronicles the incestuous relationship she had with her father...The problem is, where do you draw the line? Who decides which books merit extinction?I don't have a final, satisfactory answer.And so I am left feeling restless and slightly depressed, although I'm glad to have read the book, nevertheless. It has caused me to ponder what I really and truly believe regarding the banning of books, and their potentially harmful influences.Yet another uncomfortable element of the plot is Montag's desperate, evil act toward the end of the novel. I suppose it is inevitable, however. It is indeed immoral, but then, so is the entire, nihilistic society he is a part of. It is the act of a man who has turned on a symbol of that society, and so, turned on himself, in a sense, in order to be reborn as a new man, a man who thinks and feels, even if doing so causes him some measure of unhappiness. This act could, itself, be considered a harmful influence on a reader, since Montag evades punishment. Yet, as an act of rebellion, of a misplaced sort of justice, it is totally fitting. Therein lies ""the treason of the artist"", as Ursula K. LeGuin puts it. For the artist makes meaning out of pain, suffering, and tragedy. This is also part of the value to be found in books.The symbol of rebirth is ubiquitous in the novel. At one point, the myth of the Phoenix is mentioned. Ironically, civilization is being reborn out of the very fire it has used to destroy the very objects that had given it meaning - books.By the end of the novel, groups of people have quietly begun the reconstruction, the return to reading. It is a movement that is slowly gathering momentum. Civilization, suggests Bradbury, as Miller's ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" was to do years later, is constantly rising from the ashes of every Dark Age in order to reinvent itself.So I know that I will be re-reading this book sometime in the near future, as I intend to do with Miller's. Both are books that apparently dwell on despair, only to end with a feeling of hope.Bradbury has once again sparked my imagination and tickled my intellect. He also refuses to let me forget his incredible take on a future that may or may not turn out to become all too real."

I loved the metaphors, similies, and symbolism throughout the book (although at first I had no idea what the guy was talking about haha). That was one of my favorite things about it. I also liked the plot of this story. At first, I thought, &quot;This is so weird, who would think of a future with no books and firemen starting fires instead of extinguishing them?&quot; But as the book progressed, I started to realize that this could actually be possible in reality in the future. Right now, most of us would go and reach for the remote instead of a book. Yea, don't try to hide it, you know it's true. Anyways, if this habit of ours soon becomes like a big thing, Ray Bradbury's idea of a book-burning future wouldn't be too out there, if ya know what I mean.I reccomend this book to 7th-8th graders and above, since there are many similies, metaphors, symbolism, etc. in this book(as stated before) that younger readers wouldn't understand. At first it's hard to understand for anyone, including myself, but if you're daring enough to try it out, this is the book for you!"

I really got the sense that books were as taboo (let alone illegal) as narcotics are today.The edition I read included an afterward by Bradbury reflecting upon his own story after about 20 years. I was impressed that he felt that he wouldn't have changed much if he had the chance. This was but another bulletpoint in my list of reasons to have such high respect for this acclaimed author.

729,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,A38YJGUCEJ6JZB,"Robert Weitzman ""High Tech High""",3/4,4.0,1195257600,"Fahrenheit 451, as seen by high school students","Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a controversial book that takes place in the future. It revolves around a firefighter named Guy Montag, but is very unlike firefighters of our time. In Fahrenheit 451, the job of firefighters is to burn books and houses where they are kept, even if that means burning the people in the homes. The people of authority believe that books are bad for society because they cause conflict between groups of people. They also make people think more than necessary, which always causes trouble. Because of the censorship in society, the citizens have become no more than robots; the few people who refuse to conform are killed by the government. Montag finally sees the truth to the life that he has been blindly living for thirty years and decides that there is need for reform in society, and that he can help to change it.The main characters of this book are Montag, Mildred, Clarrise and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag is a fireman from the third generation that burns books. He is not often aware of the actions that he takes. But when he meets Clarisse he opens his eyes and starts to realize the true meaning of books and life. Mildred is Montag's sick wife. She is suicidal and her only life is with her fake ""family"" within the walls of her parlor. Mildred doesn't care about Montag, nor does she understand him. Clarisse is an intelligent and adventurous seventeen year old girl who becomes friends with Montag. She introduces him to the meaning and beauty of life. Clarisse is very different from other because she ""ask's `why' rather than `how'"". Captain Beatty is perhaps one of the most interesting characters of the story because he is the enlightened man who has given up because it is simply easier to lose than to fight.The main themes are censorship, ignorance, and redemption. Censorship is shown in destruction and fear because authoritative figures burn houses down that have books and other material that is harmful to the community; books, magazines, and anything that is educational that might cause someone to question the community that they live in. For example, the firefighters burned an elderly ladies' house because she questioned the community. The leadership is so corrupt that they end up burning the old lady as well because she wanted to stay with her books and they didn't feel like trying to get her to leave. Montag shows ignorance when Clarisse starts sharing her ideas with him and he thinks that she is crazy even though almost everything she says is completely true. Eventually he starts to question his own actions about burning houses. He redeems his ignorance by listening to her and finally by having a paradigm shift and fighting back against his own fellow firefighters and society's structure.One of the strengths of the book was a strong use of imagery. One example being what Montag said about his wife Mildred: ""If only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry cleaner's and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning."" In this small passage you could imagine the picture your head and live the scene. Ray Bradbury used strong imagery to enhance the story and make it seem more real. Another strength of the book is the use of symbols, such as Montag, which is the name of a paper manufacturer. Some of the weaknesses are that some of the characters, mainly Mildred and Clarrise, did not play a big enough role in the story. They made short appearances and then left or died, but they were two of the most interesting characters. One final weakness of this story was that the end came so suddenly and it felt as though we had been ripped off because the whole story led up to an unexciting end. In conclusion, the book was a good book it was very interesting and had some meaning in it."

Ray Bradbury, the author of the book, tells his vision of the future which is definitly technology enhanced.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who loves fire. In this time it is firemens job to start fire to a house of those who have disobeyed the law, like possesing a book. The people of this society are to think the same and to know of no different. Guy Montag is of course one of these people. However this soon changes when he meets a young girl names Clarisse who is quick to change Montags beliefs.Montag begins to realize that that book burning is wrong and the thing that he loves burning is the very thing that spreads knowledge and opinion. After he realizes this he is tempted to steal one of his own. He does this and the plot begins to unfold. He tells his wife of his secret and that he actually has stolen many more. His wife disagrees with him that this is the right thing to do and turns him in. Guy Montag meets new people along the way that have the same opinion about this stuff and they help him. Montag tries to rebuild his society with new freedoms after it is destroyed in war.I enjoyed this book becase Bradbury's descriptions and vocabulary usages are amazing. I liked how he showed that the things we think so little of are really very important to the life and freedoms that we have today. He also shows that sometimes inventions can get out of control and we forget how to do the simple things becase the machines do it for us. The author creates a world that is threatening and exotic but at the same time is is familiar enough to seem real.

It's fascinating how the author predicts modern technologies like projection TVs (the TV parlor), iPods (ear thimbles), and even Bluetooth headsets (Faber's ""green bullet"").My favorite part of the story is Beatty's lecture in Montag's house, just before he leaves.

Sure, you'll think about that while you're reading it, but this book will come back to haunt you years down the line.For a story written so long ago, it's frightening that society has done nothing to prove it wrong. This is a classic story about censorship that manages to enforce it's point without sounding at all preachy. It encourages thought. I wish they had made me read this in school, surely this would strike a chord in many people bored by the onslought of bad shakespeare movies. Hopefully this story serves as a cautionary tale to the people of today.

Raymond Bradbury is a prime example of this. His novel, Fahrenheit 451, is far and away the most original book this reviewer has ever read, not to mention one of the best written.Bradbury has a unique style which allows the reader to picture the story in their mind in the style of a David Fincher movie. Chuck Palahnuk, author of Fight Club, shares this same quality.The most striking aspect of Fahrenheit 451 is by far its plot: firefighters who burn houses, rather than put out the fires. (...) the novel itself becomes hard to put down. As the reader follows the movements and thoughts of Guy Montag, rogue firefighter who dares to read books, making him a hypocrite. Montag's progression from book burner to advocater of reading, to fugitive on the run from a world who decides that he has learned too much is as strange as it is heroic.Bradbury's unique take on the future is common only with the views of George Orwell, author of 1984. In both of these novels, the government decides that it has had enough of the uniqueness that makes America so great, so ""Big Brother"" must eliminate. Despite this similarity, Fahrenheit manages to distance itself with the use of censorship. Censorship as it is is out of control in the United States, and Bradbury's tale is hopefully not prophetic. Overall, few books are as captivating and original as Ray Bradbury's beautiful Fahrenheit 451."

Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better.

At first blush, there would be a few who might say, &quot;well we don't read that much now...we get most of our information from tv, our entertainment from movies, or our computers.&quot; But it's more than that if you really stop to consider that when you choose to pick up a book of YOUR choosing your are excercising not only a basic intellectual freedom, you are also exerting your privacy, your right to choose how you'll spend your time, and how you'll choose to look at the world.Bradbury considers all of these things and the choices one man decided to make as a consequence. What was so exciting for me was to be able to contemplate these ideas within the context of a story told with beautiful language and images and a story that will grab you until the very end.I know this book is one of those that gets assigned in high school and then never sees the light of day afterward......well, as an ancient 40-year-old, I think that's a shame.

745,B000GL8UMI,Fahrenheit 451,,AIFDGL2APO07N,H Park,22/23,4.0,948758400,&quot;A book rich with literary devices&quot;,"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, written by Ray Bradbury, is the chilling, prophetic, science fiction novel of the future. About censorship, it portrays a world where books are outlawed by a totalitarian goverenment, it shows how society's only goal is to achieve &quot;pleasure&quot; through the senses. It tells of a world where petty facts are more valued than knowledge and ideas; a place and time where no one questions what they are doing and why, but just doing it by rote. Guy Montag is a fireman of the future. Ironically, his job is to start fires, to burn everything, especially &quot;corrupt&quot; books that contradict the government, and society's way of life; books that make people think and learn to question things. Like all others, he doesn't ask questions, and enjoys his job, enjoys burning things, because &quot;fire is bright and fire is clean.&quot; He lives oblivious to the frightening realities of life until his next-door neighbor, Clarisse, a young girl of seventeen, teaches him to ponder what might be behind the books that he burns, to learn to ask the question &quot;why?&quot; This causes him to undergo a &quot;crisis of fiath.&quot; Examining his life for the first time, he sees how empty and meaningless it is. His wife cares for nothing else than her &quot;television family&quot; and is sucked into a world of endless chatter, movement, and moving images. He realizes the terrible horror of what society is doing; watching the tube, &quot;oohing&quot; and &quot;aahing&quot; but not really talking nor communicating with one another. Montag grows to recognize what a corrupt society he is living in. When clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag is motivated to make some changes in his life. During nighttime &quot;calls,&quot; he starts hoarding books away in his home, determined to understand what is behind those pages. Montag also tries to ignore Captain Beatty who tries to confuse him in his search for the meaning of books. Pondering the questions of life, his futile search for the ultimate &quot;truth&quot; leads him to Faber, a retired English professor. With Faber's help, Montag finds the road to justice and restoring the &quot;past&quot; where people are not afraid. Written in third-person, this book is an excellent portrayal of human nature; the good, the bad, and the in-between. Ray Bradbury, the author, paints a vivid picture of a future with no books, and makes the reader realize that without books, creativity and thought would be stifled. Literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and rich symbolism (example: &quot;seashells&quot; are the future generation's discmans) are used by the author to enrich the story. There are many types of conflicts shown in &quot;Fahrenheit 451;&quot; person vs. self, person vs. society, and person vs. person. Montag struggles with himself and tries to distinguish between right and wrong. He also battles with the society around him, and tries to make them realize that books are not to be feared, but worshipped. This is evident when he reads the poem to Mildred and her friends while they are in the &quot;parlor&quot; watching the &quot;walls.&quot; But becuase of their lack of understanding and depth, they do not udnerstand the purpose and meaning behind the poem and regards Montag as being &quot;crazy.&quot; Montag'ss struggles with Captain Beatty is the person vs. person conflict represented in the book. Since the world declining to conditions recounted in the book is hgihly possible, the novel has an &quot;aura of chilling prophecy,&quot; which I like. A sense of the &quot;not so distant future,&quot; with fantastic magical realism such as &quot;spacecrafts&quot;are common in all of Ray Bradbury's work, such as the &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451.&quot; I enjoyed reading this &quot;thought-provoking novel,&quot; about the future and censorship. It is no small wonder why there are over four and a half million copies in print all over the world."

I tried to keep that thought in mind when reading the book but I wasn't able to put myself into any type of Cold War paranoia mind frame and as a result, I kept coming back to my 2011 mindset and thinking, hey, we have bigger fish to fry, or bigger books to burn, nowadays.Anyway, that's just me.The idea of censorship and government control and general public apathy was interesting, and the idea of society possibly heading there, or already there if you want to think about the obsession with television, is frightening, but when I finished the book I'm sitting there thinking, That's it? That's all? So we suffer through all of this to find out that there's a group of people in the country who have memorized books? That's great, books and ideas and free thought live!, but then what in the world was the whole sense of Montag's story leading up to that great revelation?I thought Montag was a little wimpy and the whole chase at the end wasn't exciting. I found the writing a little difficult to read at times, very choppy and dull. I wouldn't recommend this book"

It is a frightening vision of a fascist, future America where dissent and independent thought is discouraged. Supposedly, books conjure up to many feelings and questions; people are better off in ignorant bliss. Reading books is illegal. People are absorbed by huge televisions displaying mindless programming. Written in 1960, the novel is set around our time. In our alternate history, people stopped reading books, and humanities courses in college lost interest and were dropped. Society became ever more automic and fast-paced. War is ever-prevalent, as fighter jets are constantly heard, screeching across the sky. It is a picture of a society in decline.Our protagonist Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to seek out and destroy books. Houses are all made of brick now, so they can't burn. He meets a lovely, young lady who asks him questions and gets his mind thinking. In secret, he begins to keep and read some of the books and discovers a new world. He also meets an old man who used to be a humanities professor; he shows Montag his library and helps him to see things in a new light.This is an amazing classic novel.

There are more and more ways to read a book without even reading. Television is a big part in why people today do not want to read. Children begin watching TV at a very early age and just lose complete interest in reading period. There have been studies where watching television for a couple of hours each day causes ADD which will effect the amount of reading a person will do.This is an easy read for any type of reader. There is a clearly outlined plot. There is nowhere to get confused or even lost. Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books. Now you might think a fireman burning books is lame but it really just makes this entire novel so much more interesting to read. The people can't even remember the last time a fireman put out a fire! Than Guy Montag's new neighbor clarrise shows him why reading is not bad but good. Clarrise shows him the beauty of reading and all of its positive feedbacks. Of course this is a very dangerous game he is playing for if he would get caught he could be arrested. When Montag finds out that his chief fireman knows he has a stash of books in is house Montags ends up burning his own house down.The Characters in this book are explained to you in a really interesting way. Guy Montag is explained in great detail on both his physical appearance as a fireman and mentally. Each character is explained on how he or she acts and this helped me a lot when I was reading this book it helped me understand each character a lot better than any other book.

754,B000TZ19TC,Fahrenheit 451,,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""",4/4,5.0,1131235200,"24th Century version of RIF: ""Reading is Flammable""","Ray Bradbury's 1953 phantasmagoric blockbuster ""Fahrenheit 451"", written at the height of the fabulist's authorial powers, is a tale of a world gone mad, a topsy-turvy America in which black leather-clad firemen race laughing on their steely Salamanders on midnight alarms, not to quench fires but to start them.The firemen of the nightmare world of ""Fahrenheit 451"", of which the novel's hero Guy Montag is a dedicated one, comprise an army turned against an enemy far more insidious than Flame: they mobilize against ideas, and turn their napalm hoses on the feeble paper on which those subversive ideas are printed, and on the vulnerable binding in which the paper is housed.When I first read ""Fahrenheit 451"" nearly two decades ago, I felt beaten down, nauseated and fatigued. I believed then, and believe now, that it was the most scarily bleak and mercilessly depressing book I had ever read. Even then, I felt the cushion between Bradbury's 24th century nightmare and what we call modern reality was thin and worn.Bradbury gave us until the 24th century to submerge ourselves in the dark, sedated, media-slaked night of ""Fahrenheit 451."" Looking around me, I have come to the conclusion that Bradbury was a pretty optimstic guy.Like Orwell's ""1984"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"", Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" is a dystopian vision, a glimpse into a future America that is frighteningly familiar and yet horribly wrong. It is a technologically advanced, subtle, sophisticated world, full of high-definition television screens that take up an entire wall and beam 24 hour programming to a vacant and eager television audience, 24-hour Reality programming that serves up a TV ""Family"" more engaging, more lifelike, more agreeable, than their own.This is a world where bored, vacuous housewives exchange barbs on the latest presidential contenders laced with observations on which candidate is the most handsome, and which has the most noticeable (to the Television Audience, naturally) facial bunion or boil. It is a world of 'seashells', tiny earphones designed to nest in the inner ear and breathe a sussurus of music into the mind of a medicated listener.Like his English counterparts Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury has served up a soft tyrannical state manned, not by the zealous, but by zombies. It is a world ruled by the media-addicted, the apathetic, the listless, the medicated, the overdosed, the sleeping. Books have been banned, and consigned to the Flame, not because of a despotic regime, but by the common, courteous consensus of a modern democracy desperately eager not to give offense to anyone.Sound familiar?Much like ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" works because it drills down on an unlikely protagonist. Guy Montag, at least when we meet him, sincerely loves his job. His fellow firemen are not zealots or fascists, but simply pragmatic working men who enjoy what they do. There are unpleasant aspects to the work, naturally---among them the incineration of an old eccentric woman who prefer to die with her beloved books---but like most of ""Fahrenheit 451""'s society, Montag prefers not to think about it. Take a pill, or better still take two---and don't call me in the morning. For Montag, truly, it is a 'pleasure to burn'.Like most revolutionaries, though, Guy Montag is simmering from within; dissatisifed with his wife, whose stomach must be pumped on the very evening he returns from the euphoria of the Burn; dissatisifed with the apathetic society in which he lives; dissatisfied with a job which fails to give expression to the rebel soul that burns within, that impels him to challenge his wife's brazen, flippant friends.There are three catalysts that propel Montag to rebellion: the girl Clarisse, whom he befriends; the immolation of the old woman at the Fire; and his own clandestine book collection.""Fahrenheit 451"" succeeds as both jeremiad and prophecy, true, but it also engages because Bradbury is a literary master: his spare, mechanical narrative of Montag's wife having her stomach pumped by two callous, dirty, jocular technicians practically breathes pure horror, and is one of the most soul-deadening passages I have ever read.But ""451"" also succeeds because it is a mirror of our own increasingly apathetic, violent, media-saturated world: is it so hard to see ourselves in Montag's trackless, cookie-cutter suburban landscape where bookish teenage girls are run down beneath the wheels of speeding pranksters, themselves bored and looking for the cheap thrill of ultra-violence? Is it so hard to see ourselves in the avidity of the Television Audience, watching the panicked, doomed, frantic rictus face of the condemned man stalked by the mechanical Hound, the images of his death broadcast back by the electronic antennaes on the monster's back? Isn't that merely COPS or ""Survivor"" with a bite?I've seen the Future, and it works. Because it is our world I see, our world upon us---for that reason, ""Fahrenheit 451"" is the most terrifying book I have ever read.JSG"

No matter when you read it in you are able to imagine the future. The plot was complex and was suspenseful. And the characters in the book were not the same as some of the other characters you may have read about in other books. Montag the main character in the story was a fireman and his job was to make fire and burn books and not put fires out. Most of the people in the book seemed the same and rather dull, but there was one character that was different from all of the rest. Clarisse was a seventeen year old girl who was not as dull and flat as some of the other characters that you would read about. She would always be thinking about things others thought were foolish and strange. And when Montag meets her he begins to change. Books in this story was a danger to their society and mad people ""unhappy"" as the government would say. The style of the book was confusing and difficult, and it was also easy at other times. Parts of the vocabulary was difficult but it helped the story. The sentences described a lot and helped to create images of the near future. I would recommend this book to all science fiction lovers and also people who like to use their imaginations. This is because when you read the story it is very scientific and hard. If you don't like to read these types of books I would not recommend reading it."

After an old woman commits suicide by lighting her own house on fire instead of escaping and allowing her books to burn, Montag has a crisis of faith. He's always believed in the rightness of his cause, but now is not so sure. So he pockets a few books and takes them home. He tries to read poetry to his wife, to disasterous effect. Montag has to make a choice - the life he knew or a life (possibly very short) of scholarship where books supply the grist for the intellect.Although the story is putatively about book-burning, censorship, and propoganda, that is just the surface story. Bradbury paints an eerily prophetic picture of a land so in love with its own happines (and leisure) that no one wants to rock the boat. Deceased relative are not grieved. Whatever grief is present is drowned out by the cacophany of ever-present televisions, advertisements, and catchy tunes. Keep the plebes disctracted and they'll let you get away with anything! There is also some wicked social commentary on the lack of accountability in society, which is even more apparent today than when the book was written.Often, when one finally gets around to reading a modern classic like Farenheit 451, one is dissappointed. Not so with this book - the action is exciting, the resolution is satisfying (if dystopic), and the philosophical debates between the characters is interesting. At less than 250 pages, it is a quick read, but this is one classic that every science fiction fan will enjoy."

The book takes place in a society which is completely different than ours, at some point in the future. In this society it is illegal to have books of any kind, and the story depicts the man whose job it is to go around and burn these books. The fireman, Guy Montag, begins to go against his job, and sneaks books so that he can read them. I am not usually a fan of many books, so I thought that a world without books would be a great place to live. After reading this Ray Bradbury novel my view has changed. Because there are no books in this society there is no way for the people to express themselves, and everyone ends up being almost exactly the same. This type of uniformity was the direct result of not having books for people to read and allow them to write to express their feelings. This story has taught me that books are an important forum for expression, and when a book can keep me interested and reading throughout, and send an important message, that is a quality book in my mind. That is why Fahrenheit 451 got a four star rating from me."

The skeleton needs melting and reshaping. Good God, it isn't just as simple as picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.""--Faber to Montag in Fahrenheit 451Montag is a fireman, but not in the sense we understand. In Bradbury's bleak vision of the future, houses are fireproof, freeing firemen from their traditional roles. Instead, firemen burn books, which have been banned by an oppressive government. A fireman for ten years, Montag takes great pride in his work, but has always harbored curiosity about the objects he destroys.Montag's life is changed by a chance meeting with his new neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. At the end of their initial encounter, Clarisse asks him if he's happy. The question reverberates in Montag's consciousness, causing him to question his ideas and attitudes, especially on the subject of books. Simply put, Montag's life and psyche are transformed by an idea. At novel's end, he has become a fugitive from justice, but he's happier than he has ever been, for he has discovered the power of the written word.Bradbury's classic novel has only improved with age. Reading the book, you have to be impressed by his prescience in predicting the advent of political correctness, teen violence, the ascendancy of television, the sound bite, and the general decline of our society. You'll also be impressed by his economy with words--in less than 200 pages, Bradbury conveys a powerful, moving message about overwhelming social problems. If you have read it before, it's time to reread it. If you've not yet had the pleasure, you'll get to enjoy a sublime reading experience."
767,B000TZ19TC,Fahrenheit 451,,A2ENWMGSIJ6QGH,David,1/1,5.0,1114646400,Eerie reflection on our American culture today,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book with incredible meaning for our American culture today. It begins in an unknown city somewhere in America in years and decades directly after the McCarthy era levels of censorship. Media has become the center of American culture, and many people's parlor walls are covered with giant, super-enhanced HDTVs, lowering their level of interaction with each other to almost nothing in respect to both its quantity and its quality. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but he has never actually put out a fire in his life (at least not intentionally). All houses have been permanently fireproofed with plastic sheaths for nearly 50 years, and the jobs of firemen have been changed from protecting the public from fire to ""protecting"" the public with fire. As reality TV, comedy shows and pulp fiction/romance novels became more and more popular, non-fiction and the classics were read less and less until, as Captain Beatty, the fire captain and primary personified villain of the novel, says, ""(Most people's) sole knowledge of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.'"" As public interest in books, newspapers, and other sources of information waned, the school system and general level of education grew less and less complex/competent, until eventually the government took advantage of the situation and began cutting off all books which ""offended"" any minority, no matter how small, proclaiming equal treatment for all and the evils of literature loudly. In order to enforce this ban which the people had so perfectly brought down upon themselves, the government changed the fire department into its secret police, stating that they were protecting the public from the ""harm"" of these books while truly cutting them off from the only source of knowledge able to save them from the impending but largely ignored or unconcerning massive international atomic war. As Guy races against time, the odds, and the power of the government and its incredibly seductive mass media, he attempts to break through to someone, trying to find some way to destroy the killer system before it's too late. Can he destroy the system with the help of an old retired English professor named Faber? Or will Captain Beatty and the government's deadly Mechanical Hound catch up with him first? The playing out and ultimate conclusion of this conflict is an incredibly deep and powerful reflection on our American culture today, and on our seemingly insatiable desire for pleasure and entertainment without having to do any more work or self-education/learning in order to get it than we see as being absolutely necessary. Written in McCarthy era America before the dawn of the television, the rise of televised NFL and ESPN, and the surrealistic and ever growing worlds of video games, movies and the Internet, Fahrenheit 451 predicts with eerie accuracy directions in our culture which 50 years ago would have been regarded as impossible science fiction dystopia, but now are considered an ever growing part of normal daily life. As the quality of our public school system continues to decline, and fast cars, pornography, and having fun with friends quickly become more important than keeping on top of government, state, or even local affairs for the vast majority of the American population, one might stop to wonder between one's job and the entertainments we all seem to live for and rush home to every night why we're doing anything like this-what is it we really value in life? In Montag's world, the sources for those values have been taken away, sacrificed to the peoples' ever-growing and insatiable desire for pleasure. Will--or could--our civilization go the same way, walking blindly to the very edge of a worldwide atomic war? Judge for yourself after reading America's fate in the incredible future-predicting novel Fahrenheit 451."

This book was interesting enough to make me read it in one or two sessions. I still remember the book and how I felt about it as a child reading it. I vaguely remember my teacher at the time saying in certain places they have outlawed this book but have never thought of it until it was in a daily program on disney recently. I have never really watched this program as it is primarily a childrens show but the advertisement caught my eye as I was flipping channels. It was showing a teacher getting arrested along with his students for merely reading this book. This is when I remembered my teacher saying something about its legality in some states. Is this Union such that we have to hide to read such works of art? I think this action is exactly what Bradbery was trying to prevent in society. He may have been trying to show people what the world would become if we tryed to enforce a sort of literature policy. Where would we be if Shakespeare's works had been baned? I believe this was an excellent book and every child should have the freedom to enjoy it. I hope that when my son is that age he will have the same freedom that I enjoyed in school.

I was instantly hooked. His writing has a simplicity to it, but at the same time, an amazing profoundness. I immediately went out to the bookstore and bought a book of his short stories--then another, and finally, I read Fahrenheit 451. His style is constant--his use of metaphors has more of an impact than any other author I've ever read. He has a rare ability to deviate from the regular stereotypes of the future, making the settings as believable as if they were set in the present time.I immensely enjoyed this. It really conveyed the image of what a world would be like without books--lacking substance and meaning; having pleasure at violence and taking for granted what they had. Mr. Bradbury never ceases to amaze me. The character, Montag, was a perfect balance of the influences society had impacted him, and his own emerging understanding of reality.I'm greatly inspired by this, and I hope to mature enough to write something of as much quality as Fahrenheit 451."

Even though I was much younger than I am now when I finished it (I'm 20), I was still able to realize that the future Ray Bradbury portrays in this wonderful work of fiction is entirely possible. I absolutely love to read, a bibliophile if you will, and when I first realized that the world in this book takes pride in BURNING them AND the people who read them I remember thinking, ""God help us"". What made me say that is the realization that many of my fellow class mates all throughout school (K-12) did NOT like to read one bit but they did like to burn and destroy things. Society, in the story, values everything that destroys knowledge and wisdom so that those in charge are able to stay in power and keep everyone under there thumb. Turning people into mindless sheep. Many of the technological ""advances"" (I consider them more of a step back then a step forward) include only a few hours of school with nothing actually learned, destruction parks where people can go smash and destroy everything there, insanely fast cars, and (in my opinion the worst one) the ENTIRE room dedicated to television. This book is an extremely accurate portrayal of where American society is headed if we do not do something to stop this trend. We must value knowledge and wisdom above all else because those two things are what primarily separate us from all other animals. I absolutely loved this book and author and I hope you will pick this up and give it a try."

The story encased in this bound grouping of parchment is a warning to the societies of today against censorship and ignorance, which I really enjoyed.The book takes place somewhere in the 21st Century, and revolves around a man named Guy Montag, who is a fireman, but not of the conventional sense. The government of the story's time is one of ignorance and arrogance. It boasts several nuclear wars and a ban against books, which is where the firemen come into play; whereupon books are found, the firemen appear soon afterwards.The entire line of events surrounding Guy and his job is very interesting and thought-provoking, lined with intellectual discussions concerning firemen, the ban, and the emotional detachment to most other people that is sported by the entire population of the country.The conclusion of this book is surprising, and highlights a miniscule but hardy population of intellectuals living outside the public eye, just waiting for the opportunity to bloom in a society wiped clean by their own conceit and cruelty. Plus, it's nice to think that, even in a world full of lies and spite, intelligence and compassion can still survive, even if it's only in a brilliant literary work.At around 179 pages long, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, as well as a powerful one.

There he commits murder, which sends him on the run from the city. Outside the city, he witnesses it being destroyed by an atomic bomb.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting story because of the unique setting. It is set in the near future in a modern city, but with a much different type of society. Thought they do not realize it, everyone seems to be depressed, compared to real modern society. The setting is also interesting because of the censorship at full extent. With houses being fireproof, firemen's new job is too set them ablaze. With no books, the true facts a completely unknown to the public, with false facts like Benjamin Franklin began the Firehouse and that houses have always been fireproof.The characters are also interesting. Guy Montag is the lone person he knows who reads books, though he burns them and makes no sense of them. Beatty is an ironic man. Though he is big on burning books and how useless they are, it is obvious he reads them as well because he is a rather cunning intellectual and is able to manipulate almost anybody effortlessly. Another unique person is Clarisse McClellan. She is what one in their society might call an antisocial figure because of her odd habits and strange curiosityThis book is a must read, with such realistic settings and people.

Its use of symbolism was sometimes difficult to comprehend, but our teacher was helpful in helping us to interpret what these symbols meant through class discussions. For example, a beetle, which was a black car, represented evil (Satan-like), and when Bradbury referred to a black cobra crawling down her (Mildred) stomache, they meant a stomache pump. Through all this symbolism, Ray Bradbury truly made this a great book because you had to piece everything together as if it were a puzzle. I liked how the setting took place in the future. Their world was always &quot;on-the-go&quot; and non-stop in a way that they had no time to socialize. They always had a controlled schedule. The government was very strict because they controlled what they were allowed and not allowed to do, and if anyone disobeyed these harsh rules, the consequeces would be severe and possibly fatal.

In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the ""family"" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone."

Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time.

Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland.

It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real, that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one , by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire , follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!!"

Or, rather, there's the central idea to enjoy: Asimov is generally at his best in short stories with a single `what if' notion. What's unusual about Foundation is that he managed to successfully spin his workable `psycho-historian' idea out into a (wisely short) novel. The series even kicked along OK for a while, but by the time we get to the dreadful fifth Foundation and Earth Asimov had spun out of control into event horizon of his ego.One way he gets away with a whole novel here is by basically telling the same story three times (only the character's names have been changed to protect the word count). Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are all puppet master politicians who keep their master-plans carefully hidden, pulling a clever rabbit out of a hat at the last minute to thwart their thug foes: I can't really remember who's motto was something like, ""Violence is the last resort of the unintelligent,"" but it works as well for any of them. The latter two are a bit annoying in their reiterated, `Look, it's obvious how to solve this crisis - Seldon's plan means there's no other way', when it's no such thing, but the joy of fiction is never having to say your wrong. I mean, Asimov's quasi-Marxist political theory of historical progress is, at heart, flapdoodle, but he can have the fun constructing his universe to confirm his protagonists' convictions. We can have fun to: it's a nice idea competently realised.The leading men are arrogant, spurning or using public opinion with machiavellian disdain while they manipulate enemies with the same Trojan horse technique. Oh, and they are, of course, leading *men*: Asimov's SF futuristic orientation didn't stretch as far as women being any more than pantomime caricatures, if indeed they exist at all. His only female character is execrably predictable: vain, pretty and shrewish. People are basically divided into three groups: realists (successful scientists, businessmen and/or politicians); greedy amoral militaristic imperialists; and sheep."
814,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A3LI8P7VU8UWPU,N. Kunka,1/1,4.0,1311638400,Groundbreaking for its time,"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."

816,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A1HVMK2W17T9ZU,a spiritual practicioner,1/1,5.0,1138060800,A fast reading timeless SF masterpiece,"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called ""soft power"", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was ""how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!""Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, ""Mayors"". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."

However, Foundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy, continues with these themes with better fluency and character.""The General"" continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation, and Asimov, once again, reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire, Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in ""The Mule"" Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation, like the empire, will fall. The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers, was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act, but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader, but with foreshadowing, many revelations are undermined. Bayta, one of the main characters, has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book."

Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool?

For this reason, I read &lt;Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy, I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that, in every chapter, a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character, however, the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book, therefore, could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis, whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking."

I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book.

To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes. This is the foremost intellectual, yet generally accessible, science fiction series ever written. The lone drawback is that Asimov did not finish it before he died."

And each time I read them, I only enjoy them more and more. But what would really make my millenium (can't forget to interject a Y2K joke...) would be to see at least the first Foundation book made into a feature length movie or at least a direct-to-video production. So, if you're a film-maker that's reading this, why not consider it? You'd make a killing at the box office, that's for sure."

Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."
826,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A2QEQ26KKK6DIM,Steven Liu,2/2,5.0,1076889600,Great twist at the end!!!,"Hari seldom, the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book, established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength, it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general, and dozens of battle fleets, the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally, I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire, because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory, which makes the plot not a major factor for the story, but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.""I am the mule"". As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker, all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises, this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born, having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy, a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets, with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises, so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures, the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction, the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved, the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book, the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read, the second foundation, so I recommend buying both books."

830,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""",5/8,5.0,970012800,Sociological Insights Into Stimulating Human Progress,"Foundation is the story of one man's attempt to positively influence human history beyond the grave for centuries to come. Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question."

An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title ""The Man Who Upset The Universe"". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was ""primitive"" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of ""Foundation And Empire"" are:""The General"" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""Dead Hand"" in the April 1945 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"".""The Mule"" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella ""The Mule"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's ""The Lord Of The Rings"", Smith's ""Lensman"", Heinlein's ""Future History"", and Burroughs' ""Barsoom"" series for the award."

In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."

Minerd ""The Coding Catholic""",0/1,5.0,1155168000,Individuality in the Face of Psychohistory,"Once again, Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease, backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this, I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two, dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror, destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However, I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov, for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again, we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history, some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book."

Doing research before reading this, I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book, I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read, as I was very confused. Before I knew it, im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading, and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent, yet simple. His character's aren't deep, but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work.

The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire, led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general, and the dumb-luck, mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how, under the Seldon plan, it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant, the Mule, who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed.

Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens, planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way, sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon, master of Psychohistory, uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events, but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book, and what makes the book a true science fiction classic, is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future."

Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;?

I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text, built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon, is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses, given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble, Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory, most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment, at which the probability of success is nearly 100%, always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner, as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the ""mob psychology"" of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors, concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy.

The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world, the 12,000-year old Empire is in decline, and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30,000 years to only 1,000.Going into the first book of the series, I have to say I had high expectations, but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels, but while each of the five stories introduced new characters, I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories, the question of individuality is touched on: are these characters merely following Seldon's plan with no ability to shape events, or are our heroes shaping their futures through their decisions? I have only read Foundation so far, but I expect this theme to continue in the other novels.Also, I have to say that Foundation is very easy to read, entertaining, and I would recommend it without question, even to someone who had never read Asimov, and also to someone who had no interest in the Foundation series.

Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation, there wasn't even really a battle.

I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel, ""Second Foundation."" Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for ""Second Foundation"" because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if ""SecondFoundation"" is better than this book then I will recommend the""Foundation Series"" to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning."
850,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,AIQEHMC9TKGK5,AN AVID READER,1/1,5.0,1332201600,The saga contiues! 4 1/2 stars,"It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago, i had never heard os Isaac Asimov, and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called ""Foundation"" for christmas, and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then, not only have i read it, and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general, but i've also bought and read ""Foundation and Empire"". Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned ""Foundation and Empire"" i dove right into it, and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless, ""Foundation and Empire"" is another solid tale by Asimov, filled again with great characters (even a clown!), and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages, and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However, when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one, it was easily my most anxious moment of the story, and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series, just the whole creation of, the many planets, the talk of ships, the different classes of people, everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon), i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book!"

However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.

The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot; - Salvor Hardin"

Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever.

How humans found Trantor, or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth), are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire, which controls billions of worlds, is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words, it is dying. Hari Seldon, reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30,000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1,000 years, he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new, and greater, Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories, which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction."

The earlier books are the best, as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good, but it's really the second half, called The Mule, that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi, which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for, you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it, you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that ""golden age"" style sci-fi suites your taste, you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three, you can continue, but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a ""golden age"" sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series, get the first three Foundation books.

861,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A1HVMK2W17T9ZU,a spiritual practicioner,1/1,5.0,1138060800,A fast reading timeless SF masterpiece,"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called ""soft power"", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was ""how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!""Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, ""Mayors"". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."

The Galactic Empire has lasted 12,000 years, but it is predicted by Hari Seldon, a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius, to create the Encyclopedia Galatica, a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire, but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least, that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus, and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it, it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also, the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first, I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway, Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot, and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it.

Krehbiel,6/44,1.0,1155859200,Silly religions ideas mar an otherwise average book,"I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that ""technology as magic"" and ""religion = magic"" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (""it's not measurable"") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this ""religious cover for nuclear technology"" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it."

The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy, little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome, with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read, so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters, and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation, so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism, you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them, and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time, such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page, it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming, and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end, this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going, and held my interest until the end."

His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work.

Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."

Edgar Mihelic ""Failed Mime""",1/1,5.0,1281398400,Asimov: a product of his time,"I like science fiction in a generalized idea, but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult, but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories, until lately, haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book, the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books, perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However, one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future, he was still a product of his time. When he was writing, the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus, the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare, for example, the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead, there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least, if you take this as a futurological document, humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer, but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time."

The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."

Asimov added two more books later, but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories, but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this, but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others.

Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read. Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it. If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner. Need I say more?"

Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology, most importantly nuclear power. This source of power, needed by all, then became an object of worship, and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail, it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war, and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three, so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring, I found it to be an interesting book, the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series."

Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels.

892,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A1Q8E89P3DF5UM,Aniket Desai,0/0,5.0,1003881600,Foundation is the best,"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his ""foundation universe"" to tie it with his ""robot universe"" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an ""empire"" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The ""empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes ""foundation"" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of ""control"", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering ""who is the ultimate master?"" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."

If you have not read the first one yet, you should. Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good, why skip the first one?In this book, we return to the future. A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one. The &quot;Empire&quot; currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the &quot;inevitable&quot; victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is &quot;fated&quot; to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself? And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity, the &quot;Mule&quot;, leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic. Read and enjoy."

Through a series of crises, the Foundation should be able to shorten the length of time of barbarism from thirty thousand years to only a thousand.Foundation just covers the first few crises, so the book skips forward in time.

The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible.

I was hooked from the moment I started reading. It immedietly strung together details in the first book which I thought were meaningless. Although the war between Foundation and Empire was good, the best parts of the book was the story of the Mule. This was one kick-a** story! The moment when everyone found out that Hari Seldon's plan had gone wrong in the Vault was one of the series' finest written moments, and the end, oh don't even get me started about the end of the book. I won't spoil it for you, but it is a great plot twist!"
914,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,AL1FKM2O8G9KO,Glenn P.,1/1,5.0,1232582400,Foundation Review,"This book, Foundation, is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian, and, using his advanced mathematics, was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years, and then be followed by 30,000 years of barbarism. Hari, however, could limit the 30,000 years to only 1,000 years, by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass, and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1,000 years. This continues until the end of the book, and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter, new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that, if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read. Also, if you really like the book, there are a ton of other books that he wrote, including several other sequels that you can read."
915,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A1JZLZGQZ62RSO,"Thomas Wikman ""Texas Swede""",195/220,5.0,1213833600,Epic,"The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for ""Best All-Time Series"" in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors, an accomplished scientist, and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170, and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel, however, I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50,000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action, it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire, written as a series of adventures, in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written, I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details, schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also, in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first."

I picked up this book at the urging of a friend, trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read, it covers large swathes of time at once. However, Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize, so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue, which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking, he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters, but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel, but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some, but I enjoyed it."

Stoner ""Plants and Books""",2/17,2.0,1091577600,Superman sydrome and weak characterization,"I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great.

Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits, but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion, politics, economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take, for instance this quote from page 210.""The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds""In regards to the power of economics""The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits."" - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However, Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point, but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series.

Allison (dallison@biochem.med.ufl.edu),23/26,5.0,930268800,One of the classics of 1940s and 1950s science fiction.,"This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example, Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last 30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus."
924,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A2LJ3AURXJLRUC,Mike Kenny,0/0,5.0,1352678400,Foundation and Empire,"Foundation and Empire is the second volume in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of ""The General"" and ""The Mule"".In ""The General"", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.""The Mule"" is set roughly one hundred years after ""The General"". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever, with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."
925,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,AX049BFYDYXV8,Joshua Fraser,1/1,4.0,1346371200,A great read - too short though.,"Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book, introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion, but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out, as well as the newspapers, and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book, but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under, the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work, read contemporaries of Asimov, and you will find that only he, Bradbury, Herbert, and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case, Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size, and using hyperspace to solve distance problems, so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point, someone had acted with rash heroics, his mathmatics would be rendered null, and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one."
926,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A3LI8P7VU8UWPU,N. Kunka,1/1,4.0,1311638400,Groundbreaking for its time,"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."

For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction."

I remember it as astounding, but recall little of it's content. In my early 30's, I went through and reread the entire trilogy straight through, which by then was a total of seven books. I believe Isaac is a true genius beyond most any man of our age. His insight into politics, religion, society, hope, hatred, love, friendship is beyond most anything I have known. And how he was able to incorporate these things into a series of books about the future of humanity nearly overwhelms me when I consider it. Most of what happens in the world, especially in the world of technology, has been shown in his books. It seems as if he must have has a direct link to the future."

This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi."

The first book in the series, Foundation, is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again, and that just as great empires fell in the past, the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire, chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time, and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again, repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking, it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence, even less sex, but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously, you owe it to your self to give this book a read."

950,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A1Q8E89P3DF5UM,Aniket Desai,0/0,5.0,1003881600,Foundation is the best,"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his ""foundation universe"" to tie it with his ""robot universe"" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an ""empire"" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The ""empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes ""foundation"" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of ""control"", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering ""who is the ultimate master?"" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."

Cantrell,12/12,5.0,1140307200,Galactic Empire Building for Dummies,"Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation"" was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"" he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, ""With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides,"" Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about ""psychohistory,"" a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it."
955,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A3VKTL2STG4482,"kpsting ""Katarsis""",2/2,4.0,1302480000,The Foundation,"After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is, of course, the awsome interplay between technology, politics, religion, economy, and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus, the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself, Hari Seldon, is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply, descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism"" within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians"" and the foundationeers, so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably: nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter annihilation). To put it simply, the idea that nuclear fission will be powering everything at the point in time 12 millenia from now is archaic.Besides nuclear power, there are number of minor ideas introduced in the book that also did not hold well or at all since its writing (prevalent smoking, for instance). Together, the whole technological and cultural setting of the book has sort of a retro feel now... kind of like the Fallout games.All that, however, can be forgiven for the most part since it is often impossible to write about technology of the future merely decades from now let alone whole millenia from now. Asimov was a writer and a scientist, not a psychic.Striking is also the absence of biochemistry or genetics, since one would assume that those would be Asimov's strong points for the fact that he majored and worked in biochemistry.Third, while the passage of time had appropriate atmosphere of scale (more or less), the galaxy felt kind of small. The distances weren't shown or explained very well so a trip from the Periferies to Trantor or Kolgan(sp?) seems like a trip to an amusement park only some 100 miles away.Nevertheless, the best what Foundation has to offer more than makes up for its shortfalls."

It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it.

The main story takes place much later, when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character, though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book, challenges arise to meet the Foundation, and at each challenge, the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses, the Foundation gets more and more technology, while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen, Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas."

This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence (""-the last refuge of the incompetent"") to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense, and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents, in all their aspects, subsequently debates, and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics, and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say, rebellion, anarchy, and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel, but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same, in principle, as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications, and come out with an answer that will work, without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this, but make it interesting, and, indeed, arresting. This is an essential science fiction read, and perhaps Asimov's apex."

Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also, and I know the book was first published in the early 50's, but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good, in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation, so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat."

To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience.

The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot; - Salvor Hardin"

Must you blame Mr. Asimov for &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."
981,B000PBZH6Q,Foundation,,A21HKDOW2FWVX,Dustin R.T.,7/9,2.0,1330300800,Vapid Interaction on a Skeleton of a World,"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a ""Don't you see?"" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping."

Luster ""The Rook""",1/1,5.0,1209600000,Foundation,"Over the years I have read a great many books from many, many authors and yet the ""Foundation"" series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of ""Foundation"" it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series, the ""Robot"" series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the ""Robot"" series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the ""Foundation"" series aside, it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life. Excellent read from a master of SciFi."
983,B000PBZH5M,Foundation,,A2B9Y0WXNSN17U,doomsdayer520,1/1,4.0,1028160000,Slightly Problematic Second Installment of the Trilogy,"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an ""equal"" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is ""mule"").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously."

This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic, what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by &quot;Dune&quot; and only a few others come close eg &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card) series and the &quot;Galactic Milieu&quot; series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction, without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses, eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed, corruption and the like, much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery, simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe, but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this."

Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace."

A gun is an ""atomic blaster,"" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,"" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book.

What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."

Although originally a series of novelettes published separately in Astounding, it was later combined into this novel.""The Psychohistorians"" (1950) was created as an introduction to the series with the publication of the Gnome press novel. It describes the political maneuvering by Hari Seldon to establish the Foundation on Terminus.""The Encyclopedists"" (1942) relates the first of the ""Seldon Crises"" when the Foundation is caught between the retreating empire and the growing Anacreon kingdom.""The Mayors"" (1942) tells of the second crisis when Wienis, the Prince Regent of Anacreon, decides to take over the Foundation.""The Traders"" (1944) depicts the third crisis after Askone arrests a Foundation agent trying to spread the Scientism religion.""The Merchant Princes"" (1944) recounts the fourth crisis when a Foundation trader discovers a market for his advanced technology devices.Although the empire portrayed within this novel was actually based on the Roman empire, technology itself became a major force in the story. Thus, slavery was not a problem in this empire until it began to decline and lose its technology. This decline also allowed the Foundation to spread its influence through advanced technology.When these stories were written, computers were only laboratory toys. Thus, the original Foundation series didn't incorporate computers as such. These stories seem strangely old-fashioned without household, business and embedded computers. Nonetheless, the author did foretell the use of electronic hand calculators.The author did include computers in the robot stories written during this timeframe, but they were massive devices used in the factories to design and manufacture robots. The emphasis was upon positronic brains -- something like neural nets -- rather than true computers. Maybe our industry just hasn't yet caught up to his technological projections.This novel is one of the most famous works of science fiction. While it describes future sciences far beyond current capabilities, it still inculcated a sense of the methodology underlying real science and technology. While the author went on to become a major writer of science fiction, he also became one of the best elucidators of popular science in the world.Still, this tale contains all the flaws of Campbellian science fiction. The major characters are always male. The dialogue is somewhat stilted and old-fashioned. In addition, the story contains more ideas than action. Of course, this tale is also outdated because of all the imitations and stimulations resulting from it.Highly recommended for Asimov fans and for anyone else who wants to read classic works of science fiction.-Arthur W.

George ""anne-with-an-e""",2/4,3.0,1090972800,Worth Reading In Spite of Itself,"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read ""Great Expectations"" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he ""learns his lesson"" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."

If he would have kept the book simpler, it might have been a little bit easier to read and understand. It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it. I think that we should have read a book that was more modern and practical."

This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been ""rescued"", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend ""had never been in him at all, but had been in me,"" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."

Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."

I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read ""Great Expectations,"" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, ""Great Expectations"" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like ""David Copperfield,"" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. ""Great Expectations"" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be ""Bleak House,"" followed by ""David Copperfield"" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."

As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called `Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme `rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end.

But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing.

I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying ""May I? May I?"" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either. Again, a great plot, but poorly written."

I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."

I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."

The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."

Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."
1022,158726398X,Great Expectations,,AI0WDOQ4TOLUO,Ryan Eder,1/1,5.0,1076371200,Very Good Story,"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."

Gates ""Christian, Mother, Daughter,...",82/103,3.0,1146096000,True Confessions of a High School Teacher,"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."

Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."

Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."
1027,158726398X,Great Expectations,,,,4/5,4.0,896745600,Better than you think,"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."

But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"

1030,158726398X,Great Expectations,,AWS5NBJCYLY7A,Subhankar Mondal,4/7,5.0,1153526400,A Saga of Human Expectations and Failures,"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of ""Bildungsroman"",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. ""Nicholas Nickleby"",""David Copperfield"" and ""Great Expectations"" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. ""David Copperfield"" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in ""Great Expectations"",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.""Great Expectations"" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the ""oncommon"",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up ""by hand"" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to ""marry her by hand"". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in ""David Copperfield"" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work ""David Copperfield"" thoroughly before writing ""Great Expectations"" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from ""Great Expectations"" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and ""common"" family;he is exasperated at the return of his ""old convict"" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. ""Great Expectations"" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."
1031,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A38RMZ39278OAT,redsox989,1/2,4.0,1057622400,A great read,"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."

""Great Expectations"" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, ""Great Expectations"" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning ""Be Careful What You Wish For..."", 2) it is the complete opposite of ""Catcher in the Rye"" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer ""phonies"" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an ""old"" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of ""The Aged"" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"

The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."

About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."

Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example, the meeting with the convict in the churchyard is where the action starts to pick up. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics."

1046,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A3TYLT1P5J586Y,Misha,1/1,4.0,1295740800,Dickens never disappoints!,"`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a `gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his `Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens `Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is ""normal"" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but `Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:""Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."

No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"

It's totally awesome.Charles described the people and places so well, it's like its real and your there with everybody.Pip and Estella's love story might be the greatest love story in history. Greater than Rhett and Scarlet. Greater than Romeo and Juliet. Greater than Spiderman and Mary Jane. Yes, it's that good.Sure, there are plenty of movies, but none do it justice.

1055,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A2O1FLF439GX3P,E. Johnson,3/3,4.0,967852800,Slow but certainly worth a read,"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it. (I've read an abridged version four or five times!)"

It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."

The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work.

Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."
1063,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A1ACG5CNVT61PO,Julio Espiritu,1/11,3.0,975974400,A Waste of Time,Great Expectations by Charles DickensOne of the most popular books ever written by Charles Dickens was Great Expectations. It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read.

Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, ""sophisticated"" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."

The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders.

Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also.

1083,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A3MNV2UOUTCY5H,"Lorilyn Roberts ""writing to inspire""",1/1,5.0,1267401600,Redemptive Themes are Always Among my Favorites in Books,"Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is ""brought up by hand"" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only ""friend"" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his ""Great Expectations"" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive ""Great Expectations,"" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as ""a man in waiting"" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his ""Great Expectations,"" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his ""Great Expectations"" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his ""Great Expectations"" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that ""suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.""The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, ""I saw no parting from her.""In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his ""Great Expectations"" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us.

1085,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A3R1E4K7B6RUHP,Michele,0/0,5.0,1360454400,One of Dickens' finest,"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."

1087,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A3QVAKVRAH657N,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""",7/8,5.0,970790400,interesting contrast with David Copperfield,"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"

Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind. One of the reasons why I understand this book and find it a good read may be due to the fact that our class discusses the book as a whole, AND we have vocab sets weekly to help enrich what we read."

The atmosphere of the many hours spent enjoying the book while I would have been sleeping or staring vacantly at the fields still calls me to thank my eighth grade teacher for assigning it to me. Even though I remember groaning at the first sight of the thick novel, I am happy to have known the eccentric nature of the rich old lady, the adventuresome curiousity of young Pip, and most of all the intriguing presence of the girl Pip would be affected by for his whole life"

Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action. Stick with it, and you'll be glad you did. But make sure to get this edition of the book, because it is far superior!"

Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life.

This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."

1098,158726398X,Great Expectations,,AH43A9XCZ4YU5,Charles Foster Kane,1/1,5.0,1108425600,Possibly the greatest novel of all time,"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you ""grown-ups"" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."
1099,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A3ORZWA7BQYC9E,John,0/0,5.0,1356998400,Excellent classic. Better the second time,"Loved reading this classic again. Enjoyed it as a youth but as an adult, it had a more realistic effect on me."
1100,158726398X,Great Expectations,,AJ1994G0AK900,"Hersh Mehta ""www.hershmehta.com""",0/0,5.0,1244332800,A High Schooler's Prespective on Great Expectations,"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."

While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."

I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a ""classic"" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to ""Great Expectations"". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas.

I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

1113,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A2YTHMJJJQCOZ,Ethan Cooper,0/2,5.0,1061510400,Worth the Effort,"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about ""Great Expectations"", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"

At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years.

Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"

1122,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A33FA68V0NCM5E,TheIrrationalMan,1/1,4.0,989366400,A love story and a social critique,"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, ""between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err."" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."

I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as ""important,"" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first).

McDonnell,1/2,4.0,1043884800,While a very good book I Expected it to be better,"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."

We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility.

So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world.

As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: `Too long, Sir!' `Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to `teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of `reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."

I first read the story in high-school and immediatly fell in love with Dicken's eloquent style.

Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius.

Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature.

Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."

This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time).

Stark,1/2,5.0,1089158400,No contemporary writer can touch this stuff...,"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: ""art is important,"" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like ""Great Expectations"" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."

My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective)."

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's ""castle"" and the ""ancient"" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile."

I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."

Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"
1149,158726398X,Great Expectations,,,,0/1,4.0,1049673600,Great Expectations is a good book!,I thought the book Great Expectations was a pretty good book. At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back. But out of it all it was a good book.
1150,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A1KXONMEYYD844,Andrew Georgiadis,0/1,4.0,1026432000,Tip Top,"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially ""working out"" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course ""Great Expectations"" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with ""classics"", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of ""Oliver Twist"".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction. The protagonist is poor, so desperately wants to be a gent and have ""expectations"", ... The guy doesn't get the girl. No real living happily ever after. But I don't see why that's necessary."

1152,158726398X,Great Expectations,,ABTUNH7645QJL,Peter Reeve,109/123,5.0,1114128000,"Dark, brooding, profound","Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."

1156,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A57JIBFWM3L0H,JfromJersey,0/1,4.0,1205971200,Enjoyably Obvious,"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."

I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."

The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."

Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"

In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."

1181,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,Jeffrey Leach,14/15,5.0,1177372800,A true masterpiece,"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider ""Great Expectations"" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.""Great Expectations"" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to ""Great Expectations"". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing ""Great Expectations"" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because ""Great Expectations"" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like ""Hard Times"" and let those who want more seek out ""Great Expectations"". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."

The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it.

Dicken's &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called &quot;Great Expecations&quot; his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."

As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."

With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."

This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."
1194,158726398X,Great Expectations,,A23NSKTMSPPBTR,Wayne,4/4,5.0,1265155200,What's in addition in this edition,"Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens ""caved in"" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was ""more acceptable."" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a ""happily ever after"" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled ""Great Expectations."""
1195,158726398X,Great Expectations,,AFSMGASIANB67,"A Williams ""honestpuck""",4/4,5.0,1003276800,A deserved classic of coincidence and pace,"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. ""Great Expectations"" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to ""David Copperfield"" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, ""Great Expectations"" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in ""fate"" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."

1211,0736641238,Little Women,,A1SEG1NRR6VRKK,Lindsey,6/7,5.0,1015113600,Little Women: A Classic,"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."
1212,0736641238,Little Women,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",6/8,5.0,1114732800,"From ""Little Women"" to ""Good Wives""","Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but ""Little Women"" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women."" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But ""Little Women"" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as ""heartwarming"" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."

Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic.

And while the book is ""light hearted"" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the ""father"" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it.

Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",10/13,5.0,1113868800,"From ""Little Women"" to ""Good Wives""","Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but ""Little Women"" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women."" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But ""Little Women"" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as ""heartwarming"" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."

1235,0736641238,Little Women,,A39RBPQU4FA6FW,Bibliophile without borders,0/0,5.0,1360886400,perennial favorite for the ages,"A very early reader, I received a copy of ""Little Women"" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, ""Little Women"" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist ""man's"" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."

One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."
1239,0736641238,Little Women,,,,1/1,5.0,988070400,This book changed my life,"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."

I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."

Italo Perazzoli,0/0,4.0,1321315200,Little Women,"Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society."

1257,0736641238,Little Women,,A3NORJZI0E85ZL,Hilda,2/2,4.0,1231718400,Still a delight after all these years...,"I've read ""Little Women"" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different ""types"" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can ""see"" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel ""Little Men"", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". Even though the time frame of ""Little Women"" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than ""Pride and Prejudice"" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend ""Little Women"" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."

First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."

1272,0736641238,Little Women,,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,Rachel McElhany,0/0,4.0,1335312000,Little Women audio book by Audio Go,"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."
1273,0736641238,Little Women,,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",4/4,5.0,1227312000,From little women to good wives,"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her ""blood and thunder"" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about ""Little Women,"" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women"" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-""blood and thunder"" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (""Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour""). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."

In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments. If you like the first part, you will also like the other three novels, although this is the best."

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."

In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more!

Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth show us all of the mountains a girl could encounter.Meg, the oldest is strong and beautiful. Beth, slowly washing away like a wave upon the sand. Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical ""little women"" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."

If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"
1324,0736641238,Little Women,,,,0/0,5.0,895881600,Every aspiring woman writer's must read.,"This timeless novel appeals not only to the young, but to the seasoned reader as well. None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are. Classic novels are more than artillery for our educational arsenal, they are explorations of ourselves. &quot;Little Women&quot; does not disappoint to be all that and much more."

Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less.

1330,0736641238,Little Women,,A27VJVE1SKAU8C,"""kaia_espina""",0/0,5.0,1002240000,My Favorite Archetypal Family,"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."

It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to ""Vanity Fair,"" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in ""heaven,"" and Jo says after Beth's passing, ""We must thank God that Beth is well at last.""Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her ""potboilers""--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her ""boy"" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, ""Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,"" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, ""Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!"""

But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to ""fit in"" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will ""turn up"" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's ""marmee,"" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, ""Little Women"" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."

I loved reading it and I'm sure anyone who takes the time to read it will be just as touched as I along as many others were. This is a great book to read and share with those who you love.

I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."

Hall,0/2,4.0,1081555200,Rereading Little Women as an adult was worthwhile,"I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."

It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."

The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play. They all soon become good friends. However, being in the time that are, things go to terribly wrong . . .Little Woman is a wonderful book. I believe that everone should take some time to read it."

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."

It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married.

Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters?

Houck,1/1,3.0,1287100800,Interesting look into day to day mid-1800's,"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own.

At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."

The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in ""Little Women,"" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as ""Babysitters Club"" or ""Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots"" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, ""Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,"" and this is where I end."

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"

I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person.

It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them.

If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER.

I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down.

The action of the boys on the island is riveting and highly suspenseful. Alliances are formed, the group divides into two gangs, each trying to outdo the other. It's inevitable that something terrible is going to happen, caused by one group trying to wrest supreme leadership from the other. When that something terrible did happen, I was shocked . . . but I recognized that the entire book was leading toward what happened.

He was a hard worker but was too young to be leader, even though he would have made a better leader than any of the others. This story did not seem realistic to me because it's not likely that kids would actually survive on an island. I would recommend this story to kids who like action packed novels."

I understand that William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegorical examination of the inherent depravity of the human condition. I get Golding's depressing message that man is a nihilistic savage, when left to his own devices. I understand that Ralph represents civilization, order, and decency (the alleged ""grown-up world""); Piggy represents common sense and the rule of law; and Jack aggression, chaos. . .evil. I totally get the symbolism of a group of boys (innocence) on a remote island sans adult supervision completely devolving into anarchy.Yet I had several problems with this 20th Century ""classic."" The characters were one-dimensional paper cutouts; the dialogue confusing and hard to follow; the description of the island's terrain downright confusing (creepers?). Yet my biggest problem concerned the fundamental, bottom line question: How did the boys get on the island?Yes, I understand that in order for the story to be told we must have a group of boys dropped randomly on a deserted island. The story, of course, develops from there. We are given vague hints that the boys arrived via plane crash--but that presents even more questions that are never, ever, answered. If Golding is going to ask me, the reader, to suspend disbelief and follow his story, he's got to give me more information; otherwise, I'm already holding his tale at arm's length. (Pardon the pun.) Here are my problems--never addressed:If there was a plane crash, where is the wreckage? The fuselage?As the story progresses, the boys' clothing becomes tattered and torn until all of the children are virtually naked. Was there no luggage on the plane?Other than the pilot, were there no adults on the plane? Were none of the boys injured? Are we being asked to believe there was a plane crash whereby all the adults were killed and all of the boys walked away with nary a scratch?All the boys on the flight were schoolboys, but other than Jack and his choir members the rest of the children were total strangers to one another. How can this be?Alas, all of the above made reading this novel a most difficult and unrewarding experience. Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES examines a titanic issue, to be sure; yet to this reader the message was lost because the mechanics of the story were never developed.--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING"

Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it ""boring and stupid,"" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and ""too many big words."" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked ""more blood and guts."" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES.

At first the boys have good intentions, but as time passes those intentions change and they break up into 2 groups the fire-watchers which are led by Ralph and the hunters led by Jack. Ralph who becomes good friends with Piggy thinks more about being rescued and setting up sort of a community. Jack and the hunters on the other hand think more about getting meat and themselves. This book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and insanity, and how young children can become insane without some amount of authority and discipline."

There is a lot of symbolism, and the themes and ideas are abstract and become apparent only with deep thought. Yet the implications the author makes about human nature, about ideas we purport to hold so dearly - ""civilization,"" ""democracy,"" ""morals"" and ""decency"" - are worth the effort it takes to read and digest.The story line is simple enough - a plane of young boys crashes on a deserted island, and the kids must make the best of it. What ensues is a gradual, downward spiral into barbarism and authoritarianism.It is a brilliant book, making one wonder just how thin the line is between acting like an animal and giving in to our more atavistic side, or attempting to cooperate and behave in a ""civilized"" manner.Perhaps Freud (and Jung) got it right - inside each of us is the shadowy remnants of our more primitive ancestors, struggling to get out. We see it every day on the news: the violence in our communities and around the world. And as we sit in our comfortable homes, we have the audacity to wonder ""how can this happen?"" Perhaps Golding got it right when suggested that the Beast is within all of us. Highly recommended reading."

William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you."

This is a very deep, psychological and symbolic book. It shows both the real nature of human, the process of &quot; going back to rooths &quot;, and the way the world is made. It has also very specific symbols, like the most obvious- the conch, or piggy's specs,but also more enigmathic, like the water spilled on piggy's hand, when passing the conch to ralph.If you start thinkink, how the British boys, proud of the fact being Brits , because &quot; British are best at everything&quot;, turn into Hunters-or rather animals,how they personality is forgotten and covered by paintings, how civilised little boys-children !-start to escape fr! ! om humanity and responsibility into mindless tribal dance, and manslaughter in the name of the &quot;community&quot;, you discover the truth about men.

In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; we are given a sort of scenario...what if a group of young adolescent boys were left abandoned on a deserted island. This is what happens...and as I describe some of the scenes from the book, compare them to that of a real life TV show a lot of us watch.

He is kind, and understanding of the fears his fellow students face. He accepts responsibility and delegates &quot;chores&quot; for the other boys to do. They must tend a rescue fire. They must hunt for food. They must tend to the wounded pilot. Ralph chooses the path a responsible adult might. Soon some of the boys become lazy. They do not follow Ralph's rules. These unruly boys are headed by another natural leader. The more &quot;wild&quot; and fun-seeking Jack. Jack and Ralph argue. To maintain control the boys find a large shell ....the conch....and whoever holds it has the right to speak. This attempt at order works for a little while but soon Jack dismisses the control the conch holds. He and his pig-hunting, lazy friends split from the original group and leave to another part of the island. They want to &quot;do their own thing&quot;. They defy rules and organization which Ralph feels is the key to survival. Meanwhiile Ralph and his friend Piggy struggle to keep their small group in order. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adult responsibility. For the youngest who fear Jack and his clan, Ralph becomes almost their savior, their security on an island of unknown. Soon Ralph's pack decides they too are tired of rules, and one by one leave to join Jack's ideas of senseless fun. Jack represents abandonment of control, living purely through pleasures. This is where you can form a million metaphors between the two clans of boys. Jack and his bandits become so wild and animal-like near the &quot;end&quot; that they actually start hunting Ralph in the manner of a real pig-hunt. They have forgotten society, basic humanity, and most of all..they have forgotten they were once all friends. This kind of behavior echoed alot of the back-stabbing things I see on TV and in the government, religion, everywhere in real life. Read this book and never let yourself abandon what you truly beleive to be good in your heart...Let us compare this book of instinct and leaders and followers to our own lives....On a personal note....Jack always kind of reminded me of Adolph Hitler and his control over his followers during the war. I would love to hear some other thoughts via e-mail. If you are reading this book for school, like I did once, really try to think about some real-life comparisons you find between the pages of Golding's work of art."

It's definitally not the kind of book you want to associate with and you don't wish to be any of the characters. I like the book because it is a good lesson about the nature of mankind -the gradual loss of &quot;civilization&quot; as the &quot;highly-civilized English boys&quot; degrade to become savages.

1418,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A2O3OYVJG2WZTS,Lindsay,3/6,2.0,1078272000,Lord of the Flies,"Lord of the Flies is a powerful story about a group of English schoolboys who have survived a plane crash and are stranded on a deserted island. In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys, Ralph, attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food, shelter, and a rescue signal fire.Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack, the novel's antagonist, who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book, I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example, Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon, who is shy and more sensitive than the others, seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy, because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing, his murder was very disturbing to me.Actually, the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this ""war"" against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got, the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story, cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent, I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend."

There were a couple of different struggles. One was whether they follow Ralph's rules and stay civilized to get out of the island or do they follow Jack's orders and become pig hunting savages and eventually die there. The story kept me wondering about what happens next. This was one of the few books I've ever enjoyed. I recommend everyone that reads this to read Golding's Lord of The Flies.

I believe that it is a sign of a good book, when you WANT to destroy the book, not out of distaste with the writing or the idea, but out of distaste of the characters in the book, out of such a strong passion that you want to see the heroes enemies fail and not see the heroes fall.

Early on, I was hoping there was something more to the story than just lost boys on an island by themselves. Once I realized that the basic story was just boys fending for themselves, I enjoyed it more. It's not an easy book to get through because we can't get too close to the main characters Ralph and Jack. We know by the end, Jack and his &quot;hunters&quot; have gone too far, but somehow I never felt the panic or emotion that Ralph and Piggy probably did. But the story is fascinating just on the merits of human nature. Everyone should take that away after finishing this story - people can be broken down into basic personality elements."

1424,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A15BP411HNY9ZO,Anita,1/1,4.0,1323648000,Book Review,"In William Golding's novel The Lord of the Flies, a group of twelve year old boys are stranded on an island in the midst of a war. Golding has chosen the perfect setting and age group to illustrate his point. By using twelve year old boys instead of grown men, he is able to better explore the human tendency towards cruelty (as these twelve year olds do not have civilization fully ingrained into their natural instincts). The allegorical nature of the novel worked in Golding's favor; the reader clearly understands that Golding believes that humans are not born pure and moral -these traits are learned over a long period of time.Because Golding meant the novel to be allegorical, it is not very realistic. The characters Ralph, Piggy, and Jack seem to be rather flat, as we know next to nothing about them. Also, these children barely mention missing their families or their old lives. In fact, most of them readily abandon it without a second thought to explore their inner savage. The island the boys are stranded on also happens to have plenty of fruit; the boys' overwhelming desire for meat, especially at such a young age, seems out of place. The reader must employ some pretty serious suspension of belief while reading this novel. Ultimately however, these traits helped contribute to the novel's strong and incredibly complex symbolism which leaves the reader to ponder over the true nature of human behavior."
1425,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A1X4P6CN08U57A,Rheazblaze,0/0,5.0,1289865600,More Than Just Survival,"If you haven't read it, you've heard of it and that's because the book is brilliant. It was chosen quite a few years ago to be included in the literary canon of most secondary schools, pushing its influence even further. William Golding presents a spectacular, terrifying view of humanity in this novel. A group of young boys, the only survivors of a plane crash, end up on a deserted island that has very few resources, but enough to survive. They begin their struggle to survive by thinking about rescue and democracy and capability, but it soon degenerates to rival factions, abuse, violence, and tribalism.Piggy, one of the main characters of the story, and Ralph's right-hand man never has an official name other than ""Piggy"". Typical of young boys, they find the weakest of the group and exploit and make fun of the individual. Piggy wears glasses, has asthma, and is overweight. He can do little to help work, but he is quite smart. Though Ralph tends to make fun of him just as much as some of the other boys, he seems to recognize that Piggy has a pretty good grasp of reality, putting him one step above the virtually useless ""littluns"". So since Ralph has nerve and Piggy has brains they become leaders. Piggy is more so in the background, whispering advice, while Ralph speaks up and demands. Unfortunately for Piggy, he is too shy and too scared of authority to do much else than be used.Simon, perhaps the most interesting character in the book, is perceptive, creative, intelligent and helpful. He adheres to a place of peace and rest: a garden of Eden inside the wilderness of the jungle that has grown on the island. He understands that the beast the children live in fear of is themselves. When he suffers from heat stroke and watches a pig's head transform before his eyes (Hell enters his garden) we might also discover that he suffers from more. He has a good head on his shoulders and is capable of higher level thought, even if he can't articulate it. He is the silent voice of reason. He is a martyr, facing the beast of the air and letting it loose, but the beast is still within the children and he knows it. All martyrs suffer, and Simon must do just that.There is a wonderful sense of hubris in Golding's work. There is this overarching thought process, other than Piggy and Simon who are the general outsiders, in the beginning of the book that everything will be just fine and that they, since they are English, can tackle any task and work it to their advantage. Advantages are gained, but at the price of what else? Can we really call them advantages?He also presents a great psychological presentation of what fear can do to children. Though, after reading the book several times, it is quite clear that this is not a child's condition, it is a human condition. Fear can foster creativity. The children quickly adapt to their surroundings and begin the process of regimenting jobs, building shelters, etc. Unfortunately, they lose sight of these goals rather quickly because darkness and imagination produce abominations, making fear smolder. Most of the time our fears are unfounded and are simply tricks of the imagination, but there is something very real on the island that these children, or humans, can and should fear: each other.Through the process of losing humanity the children get lost to themselves, becoming more and more tribal. The conch, a shell used to call meetings and to designate who speaks, is the representation of democracy. It, of course, loses its power as humanity begins to wane and disappear. A combination of fun and serious games turns to play that doesn't last long and fear that lasts much longer. They soon forget what fire can stand for other than a destructive force, bringing them further and further into the recesses of the tribal mind.Jack is the main reason there is a degeneration of democracy, order, and rationality. He is a very strong character, but his tenacity and leadership go horribly awry. He becomes leader of the hunting party, and though they are initially unsuccessful, he celebrates such destructive things as a a red badge of courage after a hunt. A small cut shows that he is tough and he becomes capable of hunting the pigs efficiently, while also making him bloodthirsty and vicious. His mental distancing becomes physical. He breaks away from Ralph. They break into factions and Jack's group centers around a more chaotic riot mentality instead of the rational mentality needed to survive other than the next ten minutes. Survival and butchery overcome the need to be rescued.Jack is, frankly, blown out of proportion and perhaps that is why Golding chose children instead of men. Men might feel more rational, but children are imaginative and deadly. Games can soon escalate to fights in a backyard, so why not something worse on a deserted island with no adults to break up the violence? Jack's irrationality is exemplified by the fact that he purposefully chases after and kills female pigs. Hunters don't, usually, hunt females because females are the backbone for keeping a population of a creature alive. By killing females it demonstrates that he is reckless and only wants to suit personal needs in the immediate future and not the long term. Golding was also aware that the killing of a female by a bunch of male hunters becomes a rape: sexual and primal. Jack is, in essence, killing the tenderness of a mother to make himself tougher.Ralph is not exempt from this mentality. He eventually, also, degenerates to survive. Though he keeps some rationality as he does so. Not wanting to give too much away for those of you who have not read it is key here so I will not say more.This books is not just a novel about survival but an in depth look at humanity. Just because the characters are children does not make it any less real to adults. It can be applied across the entire spectrum. We, as humans, are divided into factions, into communities. Some are seen as weak and timid, others are seen as aggressive and domineering. Unfortunately, in the grand scheme of life, there is no rescue for us. What would we do if we were trapped in these situations? How would we fight oppression? How would we balance our lives and keep sane?"

I agree with the message he is trying to send out to the readers because people are scared of what they don;t know and sometimes handle it in a crazy behavior.

He delved into the true, hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book, a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules, goals, and a leader. Of course, this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared, goals are forgotten, and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However, Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end, when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature, then read this book.If you want an adventure story, look elsewhere."

The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."

Even Ralph the one who has the toughest time out of all the boys trying to be the leader but some retaliating must have been hard to come up with. Piggy the less suited for the tragedy was in need for help with after all of the harassment. The name piggy explains it all. Even before the disaster. Jack, the biggest savage of them all, was the most unhelpful. Between all of the fights and Piggies tragic ending, he was the one who caused the most problems. Even when they went hunting for Ralph he was the one with the blood thirsty eyes. The littleuns had problems all of the time being scared and all. The twins samneric must have been very horrified when the saw the (BEAST) or the dead man in the parachute. All of the sightings of the beast made the suspense even more. The rummaging through the forest in search of the beast all turned out to be rubbish. The ending of the book in my opinion was a rushing finish so I had no chance to enjoy it.

These are just a few thingd those boys had to deal with. Watching them struggle, seeing what they would do just to survive, just reading these words that William Golding wrote with such intentsity,taught me many things about life as well as myself that no one else could.The way the book Lord of the Flies was written is extremely amazing!!! Golding has so much talent, hardly anyone can compete. Out of all his good writting qualities, I believe that allusion and symbolism are the best. It's just how he finds ways to expressthe charectos anger and frustration, relating them to biblical allusions is truly amazing.you just never know what to expect. On page could be filled with life and happinessand the next could be up to the top with death and misery.I believe Golding wrote this novel to warn us that evolution is not what it seems to be. There is some one living in us all, in the deepest, darkest corner of our minds called anger. Otherwise known as the beast. He is trying to tell us that we never what to expect. We don't even know what lies ahead. He is trying to tell us expect to unexpected. The future is a dark and distant thing.In critiquing the book, first I would add a little more detail.Maybe adding a little more conflict between Jack and Ralph might interest the reader to continue,instead of tossing the book aside.

It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant.

However, I found that it was a rather mundane read, even though it included somephenomenal uses of literary features.I had heard rumors about what themes the novel included before beginning - cannibalism, survival of the fittest, etc. I wasn't disappointed. Although there was no cannibalism, Golding truly exemplifies the deterioration of humankind when faced with anarchy at its finest. Through the medium of young boys, he was able to successfully portray how human nature slowly dissolves into unorganized chaos. Additionally, his use of literary features was clear and added to the plot, such as his choice of symbolism with the conch. With the destruction of the conch leading to the end of Ralph's power, it was clear that the conch represented order and freedom of speech.On the flip side, as someone who's more a fan of action-packed, drama-filled teen reads, Lord of the Flies was pretty low on the entertainment scale. Development was slow in this case, where the first death didn't occur until more than halfway into the book. And even then, I felt like my interest was only piqued in the last quarter of the book or so. Therefore, as a book I was reading for what I intended to be purely enjoyment, I can't exactly say I appreciated the time I spent reading it. However, I do acknowledge its literary merit and the reason as to why it's become one of the most widely read novels of all time.Sure, read it - maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. But beware; if you're expecting something exciting and page-turning, this may not be the book for you (unless you really enjoy deciphering the meaning behind various symbols)."

They land on a tropical island devoid of adults and start their own society. So begins Lord of the Flies, by William Golding.There are three main characters in this book: Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. Ralph is strong and sensible. He is confident that they will be rescued and meanwhile works to make the island a better place. Piggy is obese and a social outcast. However, he is very wise and tries to advise Ralph, because Ralph is his only friend. Ralph&#65533;s archenemy, Jack, is bossy. He grows a love for hunting and violence.Right after the crash landing on the island, Ralph finds a conch shell and blows on it, gathering all the boys on the island. He decides there should be an election to determine a chief of the island. Ralph represents democracy. He gets elected chief, and does his best to make sure that everyone is equal. Ralph starts a fire on a mountain with Piggy&#65533;s eyeglasses, hoping that passing ships will see a smoke signal. Shelters are built on the shore and food is plentiful. The boys are enchanted by the idea of their own world that they control.But inevitably, disturbing events start to occur. A boy sees a &#65533;snake thing&#65533; in the woods and other see monsters. This gets everyone frightened. Soon a mission is started to find and kill the &#65533;beast.&#65533;Later, after Jack kills a pig, he develops a love for hunting. With an army of boys he starts hunting for pigs. They invent a game in which they form a circle. Another boy comes into the middle of the circle, and the boys on the outside beat him, chanting, &#65533;Kill the pig! Cut her throat! Spill her blood!&#65533; Several boys are injured as a result of this violent ritual.Jack also becomes very rebellious against Ralph and his leadership. For one, Jack is apathetic about the fire on the mountain. He doesn&#65533;t see that the fire is the only way to be rescued. Jack represents totalitarianism and dictator ship.Despite being very creative and original, the book has some weaknesses. For one, it paints a very pessimistic view of mankind. It implies that kids are not inherently innocent, but instead evil when deprived of law and order. Lord of the Flies can also get boring at times. Hunting for pigs, keeping the fire going, finding the beast: these themes reappear so many times it feels repetitive. Too much description also causes the book to be monotonous at times. However, the thrilling climax more than makes up for these minor weaknesses.Golding&#65533;s writing style is usually both interesting and engaging. It offers insight into what would happen to &#65533;innocent&#65533; children when in a world of their own, without parents and authority. In the end, everything turns out fine, but only after an exciting chase and battle. On the surface, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story about boys trapped on a tropical island.

It was about surviving on an island and finding more people. So I'm going to write a review. Here is what the book is about.Two boys, Ralph and Piggy were alone on an island, so they thought. When they went to the beach, they found a conch. Since Piggy didn't want to blow it Ralph blew and more kids came. Since there were more kids, some people wanted the leader to be a kid named Jack and some people wanted Ralph to be leader. They took a vote and Ralph was leader.One day, they went to a rock and climbed it. Ralph and Jack and a kid named Roger came with them. Then, they went down. They then decide to split in to two groups but they would still stay in touch. They then walked back to their base.Another day, Jack's group stole Piggy's glasses and he got mad and told them to give them back. They said no. Then, they invaded (invaded what?). Later, a guy on a boat came to bring them back home. He asked if any were dead. Ralph said two. They took them and they never went back to the island.They got rescued. Most stories like this; at the end they get rescued. I always predict that and I'm always right. This book should be read by kids. It's a great book. The font is a little small but I still liked it."

Maybe I am too much of an optimist but I really can't see a group of boys turning into killing machines that quickly just because they are trapped on an island. Fighting, of course; stabbing and attacking, not so much. Like I said, maybe I just think to highly of people, but this book just seemed so unrealistic to me that it lost all of the chilling effect that it is supposed to evoke.

1445,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A3LUVZ3685QMT4,Timothy_Froh,58/67,5.0,984787200,Human Nature through the eyes of William Golding,"With this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. ""His stance is too pessimistic"" or ""That books really gross."" What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to ""well my auntie..."" and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: ""...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning..."" Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of ""keeping people in check."" Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII."
1446,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/5,5.0,1003968000,My Review for you,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK TO READ. I GUESS. I ONLY READ HALF BUT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. CONSIDERING THAT I READ IT 3 YEARS AGO!
1447,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/1,5.0,1075939200,Dream-like sensations and ethereal experiences,"The dark, indistict and yet highly suggestive cover of the Riverhead edition (1997, introduced by E.M. Forster)peopled with its shady, human-like silhouettes and snaps of muted color, provides a better glimpse than any other edition of an important theme of the novel--illusion, and its power to become real in the minds of those possessed by fear. Chimera.I think this theme is as important now, as it has ever been, perhaps more so considering the recent fears in the most powerful nation on Earth. With fear and vulnerability gripping America, the world has turned from being an oyster to a threat. People are frightened by the stories churned out by their media. There is anger, feelings of extreme vulnerability in the face of the invisible. Leaders fan the breezes of these highly charged feelings to create monsters lurking on the fringes of stable, rational society, ready to tear it up. Democracy, in the face of such invisible, powerful threats, can seem altogether too inadequate and fragile. Another response--a more powerful one--is needed. Force, the erosion or elimination of democratic rights, the tightening of controls. And of course, hunting down the beast. To ensure that all this is accepted by the very people who have the most to lose, a leader maintains the illusion of dark, evil forces bent on the destruction of a nation. And so on....Think of Jack and his tribe...then think how it all came about.Simon is the first to see that there is nothing to fear on the island, but the children themselves , with all their fears of the dark. Think of the littl'uns, missing the comfort, security and reassurance of adults, their parents. They cry at night, they see snakes twisting about in the jungle-fire (in reality the burning vines waving about as they are being consumed by the flames)and mistake their nightmares for the real thing. Jack capitalizes on their fear, while at first being afraid himself. He is a young child after all, which is easy to forget.Right from the start Golding works in images of how the island paradise has the potential to be turned into something sinister and deadly. We hear the ""witch-like"" call of a bird, see the ""skull-like"" coconuts strewn under the trees. Is it all really there? It takes the active imagination of the human mind to turn trees, coconuts, birds and the jungle into something awful. Something that can kill. Our confidence that what we can apprehend ""reality"" directly through our senses is put into question, for it is always through an interpreting mind that our sense perceptions are filtered. Our terrified minds ""see"" snakes, moving shadows...""hear"" witches shrieking in the forest, our bodies ""feel"" the cold touch of a creature crawling over us...and we react according to how we understand our sensations.The lyrical prose of the novel helps us experience what the boys do through connotation, metaphor, simile. This is what literary language does best: offers us experience, rather than information. Golding, being the brilliantly suggestive writer that he is, does just that. He offers us images, illusions in the shape of lengthy, highly detailed and descriptive scenes, which make very real a dream-like, unreal experience. Simon's experience of the butterflies dancing is just one example of this. In the same chapter, a storm is moving up. Or is it a storm? Golding uses the image of a great battle brewing, with the added image of ""drums rolling"". Rather than being a natural occurrence, the storm is presented to us as a powerful army preparing to unleash itself on the small, isolated island. The army is put there by a human mind. And it becomes very real for both Simon and for the reader. By personalizing Nature,(which is how the children experience the island) we tend ascribe to it intentions and purpose. In this way, the storm becomes menacing and seems to focus on the children, forcing them to cower in their flimsy huts when it trummels the island.And that brings me to the next point about illusion and reality. Not only are the boys creating reality, so is the reader for him or herself, by recreating through the words on the page a surrogate experience. Some reviewers mistake the words on the page for referring to a reality that they never lived. This is not to say that they are naive enough to believe that the novel is based on real-life, but they write as if there is some truth-value to the details. This is the conduit metaphor that Bruce Pirie writes about in _Teaching High School English_, which powerfully drives the reading and interpretation of much literature. What is missed is that stories, whether spoken or written, are always constructed affairs. And that pertains to any story, including our own descriptions of ourselves. We are not giving ""reality"" of our true self when we tell someone about who we are: we are presenting a version that we believe to be accurate and true. What gets left out is the amount of selecting of perceived personal attributes that go into the description of our self (the unique, single ""self"" being another illusion of Western society...how many ""selves"", do you construct and present to the world every day?).Does Golding not wish us to consider how the use of language constructs the very reality that it is supposed to refer to? His very skill in getting readers to describe Jack, Ralph and the others on the island as though they were real and to live the children's experiences may attest to this to.... as well as a history of High Schools reading literature in a realist tradition.Anyway, enjoy the novel...or the illusion of directly living another's experiences. Plenty to enjoy there."

1450,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A24031ID1CXMWN,Ezequiel Luna Jr.,0/4,4.0,944697600,Lord of The Flies,"Lord of the Flies is a story that revolves around a central theme, which is that without the rules of society human nature leads to savagery. The story begins when a group of British school boys crash on a tropical island. The only adult on the Island, the pilot, is dead. At the beginning of the book, a boy named Ralph finds a conch and blows it. Immediately the boys group into an assembly and choose Ralph as their leader. During the first part of the book, the boys strive for order and organization, but this soon starts to diminish. Ralph and his friends, Piggy and Simon, try to accomplish the task of building shelter on the island. They are alone doing this, for many of the boys are too young to help. Jack and his group go off hunting small pigs which populate the island. The disagreement about hunting causes great tension between Ralph and Jack during the book. As the book progresses, Jack's group forget their civilized ways, and there soon becomes a lack of order. Ralph and Piggy started a fire and it should be kept going at all times on a mountain on the island, so that they have a better chance of being rescued. They are unable to accomplish this task because many of the boys do not care about keeping the fire going and would rather go and play. Piggy's glasses are used for lighting fire and become an important symbol of power later in the book. Jack and his group, now known as &quot;the hunters&quot; become obsessed with hunting and killing pigs. To them, it is the most important task on the island. All the young children are preoccupied with the Beast, which they believe in as some kind of animal living on the island. During an assembly, Jack tries brings up the fact that Ralph isn't a good chief, because he can't hunt. Piggy and others are against the idea, but Jack is starting to become more and more savage and overpowering. Jack, Ralph and Simon attempt to kill the beast, in hopes of curing the little boys' worries. There is a violent storm on the island, in which Simon wanders down into a group of boys who are chanting and pretending to hunt. In all of the confusion and chaos, Simon is &quot;accidentally&quot; killed. In this part of the book, Jack decides that he is fed up with Ralph's leadership, and decides to start his own tribe. He invites any boys who wish to join him to come along. Jack's tribe becomes increasingly aggressive, and makes raid on the remaining boys' camp. By this time Sam, Eric, Ralph and Piggy are the only ones not in Jack's tribe. Sam and Eric are kidnapped by Jack's tribe, and Piggy is killed by Roger. Ralph hides in the forest nearby and Jack attempts to hunt him down. During the chaos the fire is neglected and eventually sets the whole island on fire. A naval cruiser sees the smoke from the raging island, and comes to the boys' rescue. Once the naval cruiser comes, and a officers comes out, the boys are ashamed of how they have become. I really enjoyed reading The Lord of the Flies and I would highly recommend it as a must read for anyone at any age. The story unfolds at a very good pace because it keeps the reader craving to know what will happen next. I feel that this story had a very strong introduction and conclusion, making it enjoyable to read. It almost felt like watching a thriller, when in reality they were just pages turning. Lastly, I give The Lord of the Flies four stars, because it is the type of book you can never get sick of."

Elmore,1/1,5.0,959817600,"Tough going, but worth it","Two things make this book tough going: its slow start, and its use of flowery language. You just have to plow through the first few chapters to get to anything interesting, and there are times that you just dread the fact that the dialogue is dying down and you're about to be &quot;treated&quot; to one of Golding's run-on descriptive passages. Nevertheless, it is worth it. When things pick up in the middle of the book, it becomes easier to see how the flowery language is there to create mood, and to show us, not what the island is like, but what it is like to a group of lost, scared boys. Once you start to be able to follow the mood Golding is trying to create, that's when this story about the pulling away of the thin veneer of civilization that humans wrap themselves in and the revelation of the savage with-in really unfolds for you. And that's when you realize what makes this book so powerful and enduring."

If you like profound, dark, and symbolic literature, this is a great book for you. But if you can't sit through many pages of overly detailed description, I don't reccomend this book. I enjoyed the characters, their dialouge and thoughts, but the lengthy descriptions of the island were too much, and took away from the action of the story. I think the minds and personalities of the characters were protrayed realistically, but some of their actions were not. The violence that occured in the story most likely wouldn't have happened in real life. The sequences in which Jack tries to find Ralph towards the end of the book was very overdone. The changes that took place so quickly in some of the characters were exaggerated also.I did like the beginning of this book and enjoyed the characters, especially Simon, but I thought it was carried too far later on. It started out, it seemed, as a harmless adventure book but turned into a deep, thought-provoking tale. If you can handle the exaggerations and boring descriptions, this book wouldn't be that bad. But if you're looking for a book with a crisp story line and reasonably fast paced action, &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; wouldn't be it."

If I did, I probably would rate this book at a lower score. Anyway, I always had known the basic plot, so I while back I picked it from the library. I now know why many teachers make this book required reading. Golding puts his view of human civilization with Freudian philosophy in what first appears to be simple story of English boys on an uninhabited island. In the beginning, that is how the novel seems, and it has a cheerful mood. But Golding's main point is that civilization is fragile, and without government people are asking for chaos. He brings Freudian concepts into play, like id, ego, and superego(Jack, Ralph, Piggy). Adults here are represented like government figures, but no adults on the island mean no government. The boys do their best to work together at first, but soon after there is manipulation and mutiny. Symbolism packs this book, not only in inanimate objects, but the characters. Jack(agression), Ralph(order), Piggy(reason), and Simon(consolation that was never realized). All the while the island is presented as a paradise and a lonely piece of wilderness at the same time. Golding puts his message across clearly, and at the same time puts out a good adventure novel. I only had two main problems with Lord of the Flies. One is that overall, the island seemed to be very small and needed more decription of it's physical features, and two, Golding should have put the boys' average age a few years ahead. But those aside, this novel is a good one, being rightful to earn classic status. If you like to read something that makes your brain crank while being entertained, Lord of the Flies is a pretty damn good deal."

I think that Golding's use of children as the main characters in the novel is helpful in conveying this message. The children's refusal to follow Ralph stems from the nature of children, in that they found no excitement or satisfaction from following him and his rules. Ralph's maturity resembled that of grown-ups, which children revolt against. On the other hand, Jack's group offered as an incentive more childish excitement in paiting themselves, hunting and ceremonies. We, as the reader, can see the children's folly in following Jack, but they are unable to think rationally due to their immature natures and new-found freedoms. Using children, Golding tries to symbolize the essential qualities in every human's soul and reveal something to the reader about him or herself."

After plodding throught Frankenstein, I was prepared for another book that English teachers love, but that I would hate. Well, I was very surprised, and would say this book is easily in my top 5. On the surface its a classic tale of adventure. But inside its words, is a very saddening yet uplifting view on humanity. As the boys on the island begin to lose their English schoolboy discipline and revert back to uncivilized savages its hard to see the upside. But when Ralph finally gets rescued by his British Navy Officer you can see how Ralph is changed and ready to contribute greatly to our civilazation. A leader who recognizes his own capacity for evil, but by seeing it can deal with it, and push his good to front. As I read the last few words of the book my final thought was &quot;Can't we all just get along!&quot; And what would we be capable of if we did?

What if it was to happen to you? Would you know what to do to survive? Lord of the Flies by William Golding brings Golding's moral philosophy into an intriguing story of a group of boys crash landing on a deserted island. As the boys attempt to survive, new problems arise from the lack of society that force the boys back to the clutches of their natural instincts.A group of British schoolboys crash land on an uninhabited island somewhere in the ocean. With the only adult on the plane being killed in the crash, the two oldest of the boys, Ralph and Jack, begin a power struggle to be the leader of the boys. Ralph begins his life on the island by trying to incorporate a democracy within the group of boys. The boys then vote for a leader and they almost unanimously choose Ralph. The boys show their wish for society by making some rules to abide by. From the moment Ralph was voted leader, Jack was always his rival, whether he showed it or not. To show his strength, Jack starts a group of hunters that savagely kill the wild pigs on the island. The younger children of the island have their own problem, dealing with the fear of ""The Beastie"" supposedly a giant snake this imaginary beast develops into a creature that all of the boys' fear. Little do they know how the once imaginary beast would affect their lives. After Ralph confronts Jack about his hunters acting savagely Jack is enraged and orders a re-vote for leader. Once again, Ralph is voted leader again and Jack leaves the tribe to form his own group. To add to the conflict between them, the rest of the boys split off into two groups following either Ralph or Jack as their leader. To the reader this starts off as being a childish game, but when children start getting killed it evolves into a deadly struggle for power between the groups.This book is taught in almost every school system in the country giving a new perspective of human nature with its immense amount of symbolism throughout it. Depending on how you look at it the book can be broken down into different kinds of symbolism including human civilization, Freudian Psychology, and a religious allegory. As a reader, I personally saw the book as a vision of human civilization in which the island is a microcosm of the world. The main characters each represent an aspect of human society including human virtues, violence, civilization, intellect, and peace. Aside from the characters, key objects in the story also represent something on a higher term. In one reading it may not be possible to catch every symbol within the book, which may encourage you to read it more than once.Everyone who reads this book should be able to find a way to relate it to the world today. One of the best things about this book is that the way someone interprets the symbols is different from the next person. The general audience of this book is high school students who were forced to read it for an assignment, I being one of them. But I believe this book can be enjoyable to anyone of almost any age if they have an open mind. In my opinion, one of the main reasons why a student wouldn't like this book would be because they were forced to read it, and didn't really read deeply to discover all of the hidden meanings. But if you are open minded and enjoy a good book I suggest reading the adventurous eye-opening book, Lord of the Flies by William Golding.Golding, William. Lord of the Flies. New York: The Berkley Publishing Group, 1954."
1473,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A3KJI8YPE2JLLF,Alex Simmons,0/0,3.0,1070409600,Great Book,"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, was an interesting book. I enjoyed the book because I like adventurous books, and I like the plot of the book. If you don't like stories with only children characters and an outdoor setting I don't recommend this book. The book is set on a deserted island. A plane crashed and stranded a whole bunch of kids on a small deserted island with no adults. The kids make an adventure out of the situation and form a tribe and pick a chief. The kids build huts on the beach and hunt for pigs, which are the best source of food on the island. I especially like the fact that Golding had added symbolism into the story and it was very interesting to me. Some of the symbolism that stood out to me was the conch as a symbol of authority and bought the whole group together. Piggy as a symbol of intelligence, Simon as a symbol of imagination. Throughout the book, there is one boy who is ridiculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two tribes. A hunting tribe and a tribe to try to get rescued. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused on trying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them. Jack had a strange desire for hunting and no care with what happens to them on the island. Piggy seems like a bright child with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance he receives no respect from the other kids. Again I enjoyed this book it kept my attention thought the whole time I was reading it. It was a great story to read and be apart of I would defiantly recommend this book to a friend."
1474,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/0,4.0,872553600,A great fable,"I read this novel a long time ago in its Russiantranslation (a reasonably good one), but it goeswithout saying that the original is vastly superior to any translation.The entire novel is symbolist - from the very firstsentence to the very last, and in this symbolism lie both its strength and its greatest weakness. The problem is: it is *too* neatly symbolic, all symbols fit too perfectly into the author's preconceptions. This book is definitely a fable (as opposed to fiction), but for a fable it is a very good one."
1475,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A20VXF9DYI0I6H,J. Norburn,3/4,4.0,1174780800,A fascinating social experiment and chilling morality tale,"The cold war era produced a lot of fiction that explored the corrupting influence of power and the rising threat of totalitarian governments, warning us that no society was immune. But while authors like George Orwell were more interested in the machinery of totalitarian governments, how they rise to power and how they maintain control, Golding was more interested in humanity, the flaws of human nature and how quickly we can revert to savagery.Golding wasn't the first author to explore the concept of mob mentality or the savage nature of man, but he was the first to illustrate it so chillingly with a group of British school boys.I have one small complaint about the novel. Golding never offers a satisfactory explanation about how these boys end up on the island. The novel provides only a vague explanation regarding a plane that was shot down. Golding never explains where the boys were going when the plane was attacked, why there were no adults with them except the pilots, why so few of them knew one another, why they were initially scattered all over the island, and so on. The reality is that in order for Golding to conduct his literary social experiment he needed the boys to be on the island with no apparent chance of rescue, and with no adult presence. It was also critical that the majority of boys not know each other, that they be of various ages, and that they initially be separated from one another so that they can come together and form a new society. Because there was no plausible back story to explain all this, I was never fully convinced that Lord of the Flies was something more than a contrived social experiment.That said it's a fascinating social experiment. While contrived, Lord of the Flies is a compelling novel, an exciting adventure story and a powerful morality tale. The novel is extraordinarily well written with descriptive prose that brings the sights, sounds, and smells of the island to life.Lord of the Flies is a disturbing tale that reminds us that civility is an artificial state and very fragile indeed (At least for humans with a Y chromosome). Had the island been inhabited by a group of school girls I don't suppose it would have been necessary for one of the girls to issue the cryptic, sinister warning that someone had ""sharpened a stick at both ends.""I highly recommed this novel. It's worth reading, even if Jr. High School is just a distant memory."

We read it in class one day and I started to get sick. We were on Chapter 4 and then I went home. I was sick a whole week, so I know that I missed out on an immense amount of reading. So I got an idea one morning. I told my mom to go buy me the book. She went and purchased it and I begin to catch up on my reading. I really enjoyed this book. I encourage my friends to read this. It was very inspiring. My teacher said that scientists believe that it was based on a true story, but he said they do not have enough evidence to prove that it really happened. In my opinion, I think it couldn't have happened because everyone knew where the boys were traveling to and when the boys came up missing, they could have retraced their route and went back looking for them. This is my review of the book. I attend St. Andrews Middle School and I read this in an AAP Young Literature Class. Now at my age, this book would be considered to a little to old, but I understood it quite well.Audra Williams"

Golding used the simple technique called description that captivated my attention from the very first chapter. Golding really knows how to right a book to engulf readers who really don't like to read.

1480,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A1GJIUYNH5MUI9,DM635,2/2,5.0,1147392000,Riveting and Emotional,"Have you ever thought about what extent someone would go through just to stay alive? Well find out in William Golding's book Lord of The Flies. The Lord of The Flies is a gripping book that takes you through the lives of a group of young British school boys whose plane crashes and leaves them fighting with nature and each other to stay alive and make it off of the isolated island. The group of boys try to start their own low class government and constitution, but when one of the young boys can't face this new government he breaks away and starts his own government which throws the island into a form of civil war. One by one each of the boys begin to lose their sanity and began eliminating each other. It shows just how easy it is for a group of normal civilized human beings can drastically change into inhuman and insane human beings when the stress and the extreme possibility of death is near. This book is riveting and emotional that proves that even the most civilized and disciplined people can turn into insane psychopaths. I highly recommend this book."

1482,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,ADHJ30PD2RPF4,"W. Dunham ""Really Philip""",2/2,3.0,1096675200,Too predictable for me,"Lord of the Flies was not one of the better books I have read. I felt that the book was a little too predictable. I was surprised that this was Golding's response to the evils he saw in WWII as a member of the Royal Navy, because I figured it would be more graphic or have been about the war, rather than the story of a group of English schoolboys whose plane is shot down on an island. At the beginning of the book when Ralph calls all the boys who survived the plane crash with the conch and they voted him leader over Jack, I could tell that the conflict of the story would be between these characters. I did not feel like Golding was able to get across his theme of the inner evil of mankind because of his character choice of a group of young boys. From personal experience I can tell you that almost all young boys are mischievous and have an evil side to them, but I don't feel that they are an accurate representation of all humans. However, I do feel that Golding used a lot of great symbolism in this novel with the use of Piggy's glasses as being able to see things for what they really are, and the use of the conch to represent power and order. Another interesting thing is Beelzebub, one of the fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, translates to Lord of the Flies. For the theme of evil Golding was trying to use, this was a great title."
1483,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A1C6OFO0TXGSYS,"Keith B ""kbang""",0/0,4.0,1286668800,Good Story,"The book Lord of the Flies by William Golding was very good. The title is talking about boys who get stranded on an island and find a monster named the Lord of the Flies. The setting of the novel is on an island in 1954. The protagonist of the story, and my favorite character, was definitely Piggy. He was always trying to solve problems and be nice. The antagonist can be lot of different characters, but I think it was Jack. He was always trying to take control. I didn't like him. All of the characters were very believable and very interesting. This book is about boys who get trapped on an island. They try to work together and survive, but a beast roams the island they are on. The boys have to stop the beast, but even harder than that they have to try to work together. The rising action was when they found out the beast was real. The climax was when the boys started to fight.You found out about the boys in the story when they have their fist meeting. The writing described every little thing the boys did. The story is trying to be kind to one another is hard when also trying to run a town. The author is saying that you should not try to take control. You should let everyone have a say. I liked this book and would recommend it to lots of people. If you can get passed the blood you will love it."
1484,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A1EOCM51YO3ELD,Kat Williams,1/1,5.0,1137110400,A Story of An Utopian Society,"The book of Lord Of The Flies begins as a story of a bunch of innocent boys. These young boys are shown things that many of us have never seen and that we will never see. They escaped Europe because of a war and their plane crashed so they ended up on an island, no one knowing who or where they were. The boys are afraid of a ""monster"" but in the many reflections of symbolism in this book, they are the monster. They boys start out being civilized and end out becoming savages. The idea of an utopian society is seen throughout the book. The boys first believe that the world will be great, a world without parents, adults or teachers to scold. They thought that the world would be so much better on the island. It shows that the utopian society does not work and will eventually become corrupted.The end of the book takes an interesting turn and will suprise everyone who has ever read it. It is defidently a book to read for all ages."

Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book.

The way Golding starts the story you can tell that you're going to be for quite a ride, as he places you right in the middle of the action, perhaps to give you the chance to understand the confusion the children faced.This book begins with the children being thrown on an island and having to figure out a way to survive. They eventually seem to get themselves pretty well organized except for a few lazy workers. Then we start to see more and more people neglecting their work and this eventually turns into a small rebellion that continues to grow throughout the book.Since coming to the island the only two people there who had the ability to lead the group was Jack and Ralph. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused ontrying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them.Jack had a strange desire for hunting that slowly grew into a sick obsession by the end of the book. Jack eventually becomes fed up with the way Ralph is running things and branches away from the group. Support for Jack's group slowly grows as the book goes on. Either a desire to hunt or an unwillingness to work eventually causes just about everyone to leave Ralph's group except for Piggy.Piggy seems like a bright boy with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance and the complete disrespect he recieves from the other kids no one ever pays attention to him. The ironic part about it is that the cause of all the chaos on the island was the absence of an adult, which except for his age, was basically Piggy.While the children in the hunters group feared only the beast as they went on their daily hunts, Piggy and Ralph had to contstantly live in fear of the other children, who had become scary and unpredictable. The children in the hunters group revolved their entire world around the beast, who they had all accepted as real at this point. In this world they forgot about ever trying to get back home and seemed out of touch with reality as they casually talked about killing their friends.Another friend of Ralph's on the island was Simon, who never had much to say , but you could tell had a lot on his mind.To emphasize the drastic downward spin the islands tiny society had taken he punished the only two children Ralph could trust and readers had come to know.When the children all finally come back into contact with an adult he acts as an escape back to reality from the strange imaginary world that they had created."

The boys start off well, Ralph is chosen as the leader because the has the conch shell, while Jack is chosen to be lead hunter. However, it is not long before the boys begin to give into their primitive instincts and conflicts develop between Jack and Ralph. Jack is not interested in Ralph's rules or the fire and eventually moves to the other side of the island and creates his own tribe. Things continue to spiral out of control from there, Jack steals fire from Ralph and then their are acts of violence against other boys in the group. The whole adventure comes to an end when the boys are rescued by a Britsh navy ship.Golding has created one of the classic books of modern literature. His characters are sharp and very well done. His descriptions of the boys and island are well done as well. His story-telling is tight and he never looses the thread of his story amongst all of his symbolism. Symbolism is what truly separates Golding's work from other novels. Every character represents part of human nature - Ralph is the ego, the organized part of society that has rules, while Jack is the Id, the part of our brain that wants to give into our base emotions. Piggy represents the superego and his glasses, or specs, intellectual thought. Golding's characters and their actions on the island force the reader to take a hard look at their own nature and how they might react in a similar situation.This book is absolutely one of the classics. I read this book several years ago in high school and enjoyed it. I just read it again and age has given me an entirely new perspective on the characters and what Golding is trying to say. If you have not read this book, I strongly suggest that you do. It is not one to be missed!"

I thought he was one of the most important characters in the book. His death foreshadowed the death of Piggy and the smashing of the conch. And Ralph was awesome! He sounds hott!! The book had a lot of symbolism and that's fun to figure out. Golding didn't just come out and say what was happening. You had to figure out what he was talking about. I loved this book. Thank you and goodnight.

From everyone that I have ever chatted to about this novel, they all share the same responses, and that is that William Goldings Lord of the Flies is simply not a good book. Human nature is evil and corrupt is about all this book goes into, and it is all written from a childs perspective, dull and flat. This book delves into the loss of innocence, but these children as soon as they are introduced appear haughty and arrogant and self-absorbed. And then, throughout the book, they go on and fight with one another due to their level of immaturity, and end up murdering one another. This book is not about human nature, it is about the immaturity of children. These children do not think throughout the entire book, and it just seems stupid and a pointless read. This book also offers no resolutions to this ""problem"". People can be evil. Look at all the wars throughout time, and the terrible things people can do to one another. We don't need a book to point this out. It is common sense. Golding has accomplished nothing, and many, many people agree."
1503,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/1,3.0,1161648000,Kristen's Review on Lord of the Flies,"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called ""good"" island, into a ""bad"" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today."

Not only did it have one of the best story lines a book could have; it also delivered a very important message pertaining to rules and anarchy. The book was about a group of young boys who's plane crashed on an island. There are no adult survivors and the kids are left to fend for themselves. Some of the boys that are on the island are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and Simon. Ralph is kind of the leader of the boys in the beginning. He is later left alone with piggy, a rotund boy whose glasses play a very important role in the book. Jack is one of the meanest boys on the island. He is the leader of the choirboys, which later become the hunters. He is the one who later takes control of the group and moves them to the other side of the island and attacks Jack and Piggy. Simon is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. He also represents pureness among the boys. The book is about how a world without rules would only result in chaos and anarchy. At first the boys still acted civilized and respectful, but when the boys slowly broke away from the rules, their world descended into a world of madness. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book. You will never know what will happen next. I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to dive into a world without rules. It is a good source to show all of us just how important rules can be to us and that in order to maintain civilization; we must uphold these rules. This is a definite must read for all ages."

I mean it is crazy how the boys are fighting and what saves them is a killing machine, its almost like its a continuous circle.I really like this book it kept me on the edge of my seat. How mean some of the boys were made me mad. I thought it was really sad that ralph told everyone the fat boys name was Piggy and you never really find out his name through the story. If anything in this book bugged me it would be the fact that it doesn't continue on and tell you what happens to everyone. The part in the book that stuck out to me the most was the death of Simon because it was intense, I thought it had such meaning and depth, because it was the death of all reason. I loved that when simon died Golding said the trees and water drained color, becuase it was such a great personification. I would say all the similes, personifications, and metaphors as well as the main plot and what the story stood for really caught my attention. I wonder if this book would be re-written in about 20 years if anything would change? i wonder if the nature of people would change? This book is great and I would give anyone the advice to read it because you won't regret it."

While Ralph has good intentions with forming a civilization and have everyone working together, but not everyone wants that perfect life. The civilians feel that while they're there, why don't they have fun. On the other spectrum, savagery is outright terrible for numerous reasons. First, there are no rules and anything goes, which could end in many mistakes or injuries. In addition, you could kill people by being erratic, and not actually assessing the situation first. Golding wants to stress the different concepts and viewpoints that many children have.Golding was a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's School until he got a few of his novels published. Such as Lord of the Flies, The Inheritors, Pincher Martin, and Free Fall. During World War II, Golding served in the Royal Navy, and played a key role in the take down of one of Germany's strongest ships.In my opinion, William Golding not only accomplished his goal, but also brought a more extensive look as to what could really happen while stranded on a deserted island. Complete isolation transformed preppy English students into savages solely concerned with their own self-preservation. The different aspects and comparisons between the false sense of civilization and the complete negativity of savagery are displayed prominently between the complete juxtaposition of Ralph and Jack. An example of Ralph's stressed mentality of civilization was shown when the kids were out trying to have fun, he barked at them to ""get back to work."" On the other hand, Jack's savagery was shown when he and his gang ended up killing Piggy and Simon.One of the book's strengths was that it demonstrated exactly how children act in real life. This is one of the book's greatest strengths because it brought all of the characters to life in a relatable way. The point of this book seemed to be the most personal to me, since I have seen those things in school. One of the book's biggest faults was that it fails to convey to the reader what repercussions Jack and his crew has to face for killing two innocent kids."

Golding uses the circumstance of teenage boys marooned on a tropical island by a plane crash to illustrate in exciting detail how some react to conflict and adversity. The flawed &quot;society&quot; the boys develop in their quest for survival is a microcosm of our modern civilized world. Lessons and questions abound in his masterful prose--without preaching or pretense.This book is much more than just a story; it is art.

The way Golding used symbolism was amazing and kept you thinking. Normally, I wouldn't have chosen this book myself, but I enjoyed it.

1513,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A3QXS913T2PMOG,f,0/3,3.0,1098489600,Gaby's & Nicola's review,"Lord of the Flies takes place on a small deserted island where a plane full of young boys has crashed. It is about the obstacles that the boys overcome on this island without adults, and how their different characters and ideas clash. The main characters are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. Ralph is the appointed leader who is constantly challenged by Jack who believes he is important because he was the choir leader at school. Piggy is unaccepted by everyone except Ralph who sees Piggy's intelligence. This book is about how a group of boys behave with no adults and no rules.A significant moment in this book is in the first chapter when Ralph blows the conch shell and all of the boys come to him. This moment shows the power of the conch shell and the power it gives to someone who blows it. This is important because power and power struggles are definitely apparent in this book.I would recommend Lord of the Flies to people who enjoy books about children trying to survive without any adults. Also people who like to read books which show some of the extremes humans can go when there is no one in control. I would suggest people who don't like graphic descriptions of violence not to read some scenes in this book. I personally found the book to be a bit of a slow read, and sometimes the descriptions got really long, thus making the book rather boring.I feel that the author, William Golding, of Lord of the Flies is a good author. Because he uses so much description of the boys, the island, and of the boys' actions it is very easy to visualize what is happening. Also he writes in such a way that it makes the book seem real, like this really happened. Lord of the Flies is a very well written book. For me the mark of a good writer is making it possible for me, the reader, to connect to the book, and characters. So I feel that Lord of the Flies is very well written."

I agree with his message because it's true: evil can appear where ever it wants to. Just look at those school shootings, they unfortunately prove my point. I think he did the characters very descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think it should stay the way it is. Some parts are very confusing, but it should stay the way it is. Some parts are important and confusing, but they need to stay because they are important and changing them could change the entire &quot;lot.&quot;"

The story has timelessness to it. The plots and characters are very entertaining. The first thing I noticed when I read the book was its reference to the atom bomb. This is the author's way of giving a time for when the story occurred. Also people were afraid of a nuclear war during those times so it sheds light on what life was like. The author did an excellent job of describing the atmosphere. He spent lots of time giving details on the characters and the island. I liked this because it helps readers get a better feel for what the author intended them to imagine. Another aspect I liked was how the boys developed into 2 societies showing the break that develops. It was nice to see how the two groups had a difficult time working together. It showed the stubbornness people could have when they feel they are right. Inside the society the characters where very enjoyable with their thoughts and dialogue giving a very realistic sense. Something I thought was unrealistic was the violence some of it seemed pointless. Often I thought that it was not realistic. Another part I hated was the dramatic character change as if the characters were always the same and the way they were. The story started off innocent despite the accident and turned into this is in many ways also comparable to frame story. It had little adventures in side the big story of survival. The thing I liked most in the book was the conflict. The boys who had split into tribes had to deal with and survive each other. But they also had to deal with the conflict between themselves and the environment-facing extreme whether and hunger. I would recommend this book to any one who likes action and lots of sometime over used detail. This is a book that is hard to sit down once you start it.

I have read it two times now, and I have found even deeper meaning in it the second time around. It is great for any age, and the book grows with the reader. The moral of everyone having the devil in us all makes for a great discussion in comparisons with such books as Les Miserables. Even though there is some big refrence to Christianity, that doesn't have to be the main focus, so it won't make everyone feel uncomfortable. If you get the oppertunity, read it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the author was not afraid to write about dark, horrible, and gruesome things such as death and violence. For instance when he explains a baby pig getting chased down and stabbed with several spears then having his throat slit by the hunters, it made me want to yell out ""stop"" right there in the middle of my room. If you think that's dreadful, there is a part in the book when the opposing tribe takes a large rock and throws it at a boy named Piggy, he gets hit in the head and bleeds to death while falling to the water. It is so horrible and sad but without it the book just wouldn't be the same.My favorite part of the story was when the chief of one side of the island (Ralph) is being hunted like a pig by the other tribe. He tries to run and find a place to hide, when he finally finds a good bush to hide in they light the forest on fire forcing him to run out into the open! You think he's doomed but a ship sees the smoke and comes to rescue the kids. This book seriously sped up my heart and kept it going.But this book isn't just about kids on an island it truly is about what would happen if the rules were taken away, if we had to start from scratch, would we rebuild civilization or would we revert to our inner animal? Who would rise to the top the strongest and toughest, the smartest but shyest, or the handsomest and most outgoing? What would be your job in the tribe make fire, build forts, hunt? What would happen to you would you rise to the top or sink to the bottom? This book really got me thinking so I kept enjoying Lord of the Flies even after I was done. I really loved this book, Lord of he Flies by William Golding."

The book starts out with the boys already on the island. The main character, Ralph, finds a conch shell, which plays a major roll in the book, take the conch and blows on to make a loud sound that calls everyone together. Once they are all there they decided that they needed a leader and since Ralph had the shell all the little kids voted for him. The other runner in that competition was Jack, the leader of an older set of boys and the only person on the island with a knife. Ralph gave Jack and his boys the job of hunting. Another person on the island is Piggy, a heavyset boy with asthma and glasses, a very essential part of their survival. Over time some of the little kid go crazy and run away to be savages. Eventually every one leaves Ralph and he is hunted like a dog.Here are some things that were good and bad about this book. The plot seems basic at first, boys stuck on island have to survive, but then it goes deeper with mysterious creatures, hallucinations and murders. Since it had a good plot it keeps you reading. The vocabulary is another superior factor of the book. The vocabulary gives you a thorough picture in your mind of the island and it inhibiters. Also the book was only 200 pages long so it's an easy read. A not so good feature about this book is it graphic images. At some points it got so disgusting I had to stop reading and go do something else. In additional the ending was predicting. I'm not going to tell about the ending. Over all I would give this book an eight out of ten for the reasons above. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes an alternative to the basic survival story. Also the reader should be in 7th to 10th grade."

Golding just says too much on too many different levels. The book is simply brilliant. First off, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story. A few British schoolboys are deserted on an island and must depend on themselves to survive to be rescued. The story is based on an earlier British classic, The Coral Island by R.M. Ballantyne. The simple adventure story is used to comment on humanity. Golding, much like Joseph Condrad, shows how civilation keeps humanity from lapsing into savagery. He presents the schoolboys' loss of innocence. Lord of the Flies is also a political treatise much like Animal Farm. Ralph represents a democracy, Jack is communism, and Piggy is the voice of wisdom which both tends to ignore. He traces political troubles back to individuals.Many people think of William Golding as too pessimistic about human nature. I do not think Golding was as pessimistic as many think. William Golding was unfortunate to see human at its worst during World War II, and I think he feared lapses. Lord of the Flies is his warning. His attempt to help man stay on the right course. Whether or not a person agrees to this and feels Golding was too cynical, it is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies as one of the best-written books of the century. Golding encompasses so much into an simple, powerful narrative. The prose and images are beautiful even when grim. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of the great novels of literature."

When they are conscious again the boys find out that there parents died and only the kids were alive. They attempt to gather food and they learn how to survive. They show a lot of strength trying to survive almost without any modern technology. They called up a meeting and they learned skills how to survive.I liked this book because it is a very interesting book about the survival skills. To be honest I also liked it because it was very short. They book is adventurous, funny, and exciting. I would really like to read the other books that William Golding wrote."

It is a tale of a group of English boys that are stranded on a deserted island. They realize that they must work together and cooperate to stay alive. This is much easier said than done. They are more worried about who's in charge, than they are anything else. There is a constant battle for control through the whole book. Because of this battle some boys lose their lives, and others just lose their friends. They slowly begin to turn savage and fighting becomes the most important thing.

If so, this is the book for you. Lord of the Flies is not only an adventure but it is also a struggle of life and death at your fingertips. Each page weaves a magnificent story about a group of English school boys and their many struggles as they try to stay alive.The reason I love this book is the beautiful choice of words the author, William Golding, put into the book. The words paint a picture that makes you feel sad when the characters are sad or happy when the characters are happy. Golding's Lord of the Flies is truly a work of art.At the dawn of World War II, a small plane carrying a group of English school boys, all from the age of 6-12, crashes on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. The island is abundant with water, fruit, and wild pigs for meat. With all of these resources, they start to form a microcosm on the island.The character that stands out in the book is Piggy. In the book, Piggy represents common sense. He is a rather large boy, but his brains compensate for his physical appearance. Piggy is the first person Ralph meets on the island and they quickly become friends. Piggy is very supportive and defends Ralph whenever he needs defending. Towards the end of the book, Piggy finds himself in deep trouble with only Ralph as a friend.Lord of the Flies is filled with contrasting characters. For example, Jack is the leader of the gang. He has a posse of followers who will do whatever he says - good or bad. Jack is insecure and thinks that if he can't boss someone around that they are a threat. In the book, Jack is the opposite of Ralph. On the other hand, Ralph, the main character of the story, is a true leader who wants to get everyone's input before he makes a decision that affects everyone. Ralph's only goal is to maintain order on the island while Jack's goal is to do what he wants. Therefore throughout the book, there is a constant rivalry between Jack and Ralph.When civilization rapidly turns to chaos, someone will rise and someone will fall. Is it Jack or Ralph who will take command of the island and lead the boys to safety? If you want to find out what happens to Ralph and all the rest of the boys, read Lord of the Flies."

The boys vary from the ages 10-15, this is important because the older boys control the group. The main character is basically the leader. His name is Ralph. Ralph is a very interesting character. He is smart, responsible, and he knows how to survive. Jack is one of the older boys too. Most of the conflict in the book is somehow is related to him. He is a great hunter and is very aggressive. Simon is the most responsible and is the smartest of the group. All of these characters play a big part in the book.The island plays a big part in there survival. It is filled with trees, fruits, and animals. The boys also speak of a beast. The island has a mountain where the boys create a flame that they hope will be spotted. In the book a place called Castle Rock is mentioned. It is an elevated place where a lot of important things happen. The island also has a lot of symbolic elements. It is where almost all of the symbolism is. Another important part is that the wild boar lives there, which is important for there survival.After reading the book, I thought it was thrilling and it had good elements that made it interesting. The elements of the story made it interesting which made me want to read on. The characters were twisted, and they always did something I didn't expect. Overall the book was good."

So much is symbolized within the novel that it is truly mindboggling (I did spell that wrong, dont judge). Now I do believe that this novel is not for persons under 15 (thats my age). On the surface this is an interesting novel that tells of several boys decent into madness and savagery. This is all a younger child will see. They will also see pointless violence and deaths. However, in this novel, everything is done for a purpose (how it hates me to say those words dont ask why). Each character symbolizes something or someone, each place, each scene has its own importance that truly adds too the novel. Another complaint is that the novel is boring. I do not really understand how it is boring. It is thoroughly intriguing and entertaining. Another complaint is that the novel is altogether too gory. I personally believe this is an overstatement, however i do read fantasy and sci-fi commonly so I do have some experience with gore and am not particularly bothered by it. For some reason i feel like those reviewers typically enjoy romances. The final overall complaint is that the novel is too dark. This i cannot really fault this argument, for the novel does border on mild horror at some points (psycologically). Yet it all is important in desplaying the darker side of human nature. Overall this is a great novel, that deserves acclaim even if read in English class. i recommend reading it alone before you read it with your teacher. Yet this is my opinion."

It takes a few pages to get yourself acclimated to Golding's writing style, which mixes stream-of-consciousness elements with traditional narrative in order to better portray the young, impressionistic (and impressionable) psyches of the children. That being said, the book hardly qualifies as boring. The statement it makes for the inner savagery and essential evil of man is quite strong, and never before this book had any other novel or work explored the subject in quite so provocative a manner. Yes, there is violence, murder, all committed by young men. They have reverted to their &quot;natural state,&quot; shucked off civilization and become what Golding argues to be the essence of man: selfish, violent, and covetous. For any who dislike the disturbing imagery - that does not negate the importance of the book. If anything, that should only prove how effective it is.

The main concept is that if you live for awhile without someone watching over you, you begin to become a savage. This is especially bad for young boys. Then I began to like the book a little bit. I liked it because it taught a valuable lesson to the readers and to the boys that were on the island. It taught them that to survive you have to work together as a team.

1545,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...",4/9,3.0,1136505600,They Never Had a Chance,"After more than half a century William Golding's first novel still has the power to chill the blood with its cautionary tale of the degeneration of a group of castaway schoolboys into the depths of animal savagery. However, as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories, as a critique of democracy, or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious, that young children, especially young boys, must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized), it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists, Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island, referred to in the novel, and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE: It is no accident that boys' adventure stories tend to feature teenage protagonists (Ballantyne's were 18, 15, and 14) because a certain amount of maturity is necessary to make them even plausible. It is therefore no accident that Golding's oldest ""biguns"" are only 12 while the ""littluns"" are as young as 6.TRAINING: It's easy to forget that the concept of ""childhood"", the idea that those under the age of majority should be allowed to ""play"" and be sent to school rather than being put to work as soon as they're able is a relatively modern idea. Now, no one in his right mind would suggest going back to the old way of raising children, but it did have the singular advantage of better preparing children for being castaways. Ballantyne's protagonists are sailors in training; Golding's are a bunch of schoolboys.NUMBERS: Though the primary reason is probably ease of storytelling, the number of characters in a boys' adventure novel is usually kept to such a manageable number that there is no requirement to establish of any sort of ""government"" in order to get things done. Golding has so many characters that they never even manage to count themselves!PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS: Almost invariably boys' adventure story protagonists are close friends before the crisis hits; with the exception of Jack Merridew's choir (and the twins of course) none of Golding's protagonists even knew each other before the plane crash.RELIGION: Karl Marx had it partly right, religion IS the opiate of the masses, if by opiate you mean balm to and healer of the soul. Religion can give you courage and strength where there is none, and it helps you to do the ""right thing"" even when no one is looking. This makes it very useful in a crisis where group survival depends on something other than ""looking out for numero uno"" though it can lead to sacrificing oneself for others. Ballantyne's protagonists were surprisingly (at least looked at from today) devout Christians. This gave them the courage to face a horrible fate, though said horrible fate was the consequence of risking their lives for someone else. In contrast though all of Golding's protagonists are presumed to be at least nominal believers in SOMETHING, there is no evidence of religious belief in any of their actions, which hastens the death spiral of their little society.CHARACTER: This is the critical matter, as even Mr. Golding would admit, so it comes as no surprise that his protagonists only run the gamut from A to B, from evil to useless. Ralph, the ""bigun"" initially chosen chief is all but completely lacking in leadership skills, not to mention being something of a dolt. He is (just barely) capable of grasping what needs to be done, but utterly incapable of convincing anyone, not even himself, to do it. Piggy, the only one who can honestly be called ""intelligent"", is also fat, weak, asthmatic, socially inept, whiny, and blind as a bat without his glasses. (Gee, Mr. Golding, why didn't you make him wheelchair bound, too, so he'd have spent the entire novel crawling on his belly?) Samneric, the twins, are utterly incapable of functioning separately. Simon is kind and gentle and helpful, though a little bit balmy, but too young and too inarticulate to have any influence. Jack is a megalomaniac, and Roger is a sadist. The ""littluns"" are just barely capable of feeding themselves, which is fortunate because no one else is going to do it. The wonder is not that three boys died, the wonder is that any remained alive! If they'd crash-landed in a temperate climate, no one would have survived the first night below freezing.As a commentary on democracy, Lord of the Flies is of little use because there isn't any democracy in the novel! (Despite what the Colonial Office might claim, ""one man, one vote, one time"" is not a democracy!) Though Golding's depression is more understandable when you remember when this was written, the reason he turned out to be so wrong about democracy is that he failed to grasp its strengths: democracy, especially constitutionally limited democracy, is the ONLY Earthly form of government even capable of long term functioning with wicked, sinful citizens because no other form of government has solved the problem of succession. Democracy does not claim to always install the best leaders; it merely offers the only peaceful and practical method for removing the worst. If Jack Merridew had had any prospect of winning some future election for chief, he might not have found it necessary to resort to violence.Finally, in regards to the last page remark, ""I should have thought that a pack of British boys... would have been able to put up a better show than that..."", I'd argue that they did better than a similarly handicapped group of primitive tribes-children would have. Sure, the education received by the primitive tribes-children would have prevented many of the bone-headed mistakes committed by our young bulldogs, but the weaker taboo against violence, especially in the area of settling political disputes, would have made the crisis worse when it came and the death toll much higher, if only because primitive tribes-children would be expected to be a lot more competent at killing each other."

Such is certainly the case with this reading by the incomparable Cornwallian William Golding, the recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize for Literature.""Lord of the Flies"" has become a contemporary classic since its publication in 1954. Who can forget this thrilling adventure of British school boys marooned on a tropical island? After their plane is wrecked on a deserted spot the boys must manage to survive.Initially, the boys use their only resources - themselves, as there is no adult supervision. They make their own rules and way of life. But camaraderie is short lived as some of the boys follow Jack who would rather swim and play, while others are drawn to Ralph as he attempts to bring about order and delegate responsibility.Throughout the years ""Lord of the Flies"" has been called a lesson in politics, a parable, and even a myth. Whatever the delineation it is timeless.William Golding recorded his tale in a London studio in 1976. We're fortunate it has been remastered and re-released for our listening pleasure today.

They end up on an uninhabited desert island where they are faced with what seems like a perfect situation to them - NO ADULTS!At the beginning, the situation is paradise to them, until they realize that they might be there longer than they thought. They have to learn how to survive.Ralph, the story's protagonist, decides that they should be logical and set up shelters. Ralph is a smart boy in that he is thinking about the good of everyone. Sometimes though, even Ralph does give in to the primitive desires of man and joins the celebration after a successful pig hunt.Piggy, an overweight, nearsighted, asthmatic, serves as the well meaning reminder of what they &quot;should&quot; be doing. Ralph befriends him, even when no one else will listen to him or take him seriously. Piggy's glasses or &quot;specs&quot; prove to be very useful and are a very meaningful symbol of society: the maintenence and breakdown thereof, in the story.Then there's Jack, the leader of a choir of boys from his school. His character eventually serves as an antagonist for Ralph and a symbol of man's primal desires for survival. He provides meat for the group and uses it as a powerful luring agent to get some boys to join his &quot;tribe&quot;.Simon is another character you should be familiar with. My personal favorite as he turns out to be the wisest and most spiritual (not necessarily &quot;religious&quot;) of the entire lot of boys. Simon, prone to fainting spells brought on by epilepsy, is never taken seriously by any of the boys, including Ralph or Piggy. His spiritual nature leaves him far beyond the others' realm of understanding.There are two unfortunate, but dare I say - necessary, deaths in the book but I won't give that part away. I say &quot;necessary&quot; but only on a symbolic level. Once you discover what the characters meant symbolically to the story, you will know what I mean.The ending goes through two extremes. It gets you right into the action in a wonderfully descriptive chase scene which almost makes you feel like the one who is being chased and then takes you right out forcing you to become an objective observer of the scene.Terrific writing, fantastic symbolism and an overall great story. Not for the faint of heart though. I would recommend this one for grades 7 and up."

The book takes place on a deserted island out in the middle of nowhere after a plane carrying some young boys crashes into the sea and the survivors are forced to take refuge on the island. After many days of frightening events dealing with being alone on the island, one boy named Jack, turns into a savage and persuades the rest of the group to leave Ralph, who is the one in charge, to join his wild ways. Many horrible events take place that embed disturbing images in your head throughout the story. It is a unique way for teaching the readers exactly how brutal and harsh being stranded alone on an island with no special form of government or order of any kind could be. The story portrays many real-life aspects about the struggles for power and leadership that the boys go through on the island. It greatly outlines the conflicts between two boys, Ralph and Jack, who are constantly competing for total control over the group. With no grown-ups around, the boys are forced to deal with the harsh reality by themselves. This experience in itself will change the lives of the boys forever.This book is a great reading experience for aspiring readers who are into adventure novels. The Lord of the Flies gives off a dark and mysterious tale that is greatly expressed in detail. The emotions and actions of these boys were greatly presented in the writing in order to give full aspect of what is happening. Overall, we would recommend reading this novel because it is a wonderfully original story that takes your mind into a totally different world of thought. Also, if you are interested in dark, disturbing stories, this book would be an excellent choice because you never know what bizarre events are going to happen to them next."

He did a good job with all of the symbols. I don't know how anybody could come up with all of it. I especially enjoyed the major symbolism of good vs. evil (Ralph vs. Jack). I do think it would have been better if Golding made some of them cannibals.

1564,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A2PNJTZC1DVLLB,Saturnino Garcia,4/5,5.0,1023753600,Symbolism Abounds,"I have watched ""horror"" movies that scared me less than this book did. Equal parts ""Robinson Caruso"" and ""Children of the Corn,"" ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding explores our human nature in a way not seen before.Stranded on a uninhabited island, a group of young English boys are left to survive without the influence of an adult. Chaos slowly materializes as the boys gradually lose track of their main goal: to be rescued. Nighttime comes to sybmolize fear and death as a mysterious ""beast"" rears its ugly head. Ralph and Piggy struggle to remain ""civilized"" while Jack and others begin to be absorbed by their animalistic urges.One thing that stood out to me was Golding's use of imagery. From the tiniest details of the island to almost palpable tension that devolops on the island, Golding does a magnificent job of portraying it all.However, the aspect of this book that makes it outstanding is the psychology behind the story. As the children begin to fully realize that there are no adults to give them guidance, a darkness falls over them. Long term survival becomes secondary to the immediate need to have ""fun."" The children evolve from being hunted to being vicious hunters.I highly recommend this as both a good story and as a psychological study. I believe it could be an invaluable guide for high school students leaving home for the first time and experiencing a sense of freedom that can parallel that of the boys in this novel. Even if you are well past that stage, it's worth reading to get an understanding of what people might be experiencing."
1565,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A21W6PCDZWG15R,J C E Hitchcock,1/1,5.0,1354233600,The Descent of Man,"I was educated at Maidstone Grammar School, the school at which William Golding taught for a brief period in the late 1930s, and although I did not arrive at the school until many years after Golding had left, school legend still had it that the main characters of ""Lord of the Flies"" were based upon boys he had taught at Maidstone. A friend of my father even claimed to have been the model for Jack Merridew. (It is, in fact, more likely that Golding was inspired by the boys of Salisbury Cathedral School where he was teaching when he wrote the novel).I won't set out the plot in any detail, as it seems to be well-known to virtually everyone, especially in Britain where it is frequently studied at school. (Oddly enough, despite the school's Golding connection, it was not on the curriculum at MGS and I did not read until my days at university). It concerns a group of British schoolboys, refugees from a war raging in Europe, who gradually revert to barbarism after being marooned on an uninhabited island. Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the ""desert island"", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth. This idea can be found in literature (""Coral Island""), the cinema (""The Blue Lagoon""), broadcasting (""Desert Island Discs"") and even in advertising campaigns; the makers of the ""Bounty"" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept. Golding's novel, with its deliberately anti-Utopian theme, can be seen as a reaction against this received idea; the names of the two main characters, Ralph and Jack, were borrowed from Ballantyne's ""Coral Island"".The book can be read on a number of levels. On one level it is a political allegory about the relationship between dictatorship and democracy. At first the boys try to organise themselves on a democratic basis, electing Ralph as their chief and setting up a system of assemblies at which they can discuss their concerns. A conch shell, used for summoning assemblies, serves as a symbol of their fragile democracy, but it does not last. Jack, Ralph's only rival in the election for chief, forms a group of his friends into a gang of hunters, with the aim of hunting the wild pigs which inhabit the island. As the novel progresses, more and more boys are won over to Jack's gang, until Jack effectively replaces Ralph as chief without ever being elected to the position, and is able to use his hunters to hunt down Ralph and his few remaining supporters.To readers in 1954, less than a decade after the end of the war, the parallels with the rise of Nazism would have been obvious. A charismatic leader, unable to gain power democratically, does so through force, backed by a private army and leading a movement based upon a ""them-and-us"" mentality. The new leader holds the loyalty of his followers by satisfying their material needs, creates a sense of group identity through ritual and violence against a common enemy and uses his power to persecute those defined as falling outside his group. Some who initially oppose him are persuaded to conform to the group identity through fear of the consequences if they refuse.The novel's religious implications are perhaps less obvious, but are none the less present. Golding was brought up in a free-thinking, non-religious family, but appears to have given up his early scientific rationalism in favour of an idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Jack and his original hunters are all choirboys from a Cathedral school like the one at which Golding taught- an obvious irony, given that choirboys are often regarded in Britain as symbols of childish innocence. The scenes in which they kill the pigs and then feast on them are reminiscent of primitive religious rituals; they even place a pig's head on a stick and treat it both as an offering to the ""Beast"" which they believe inhabits the island and as a sort of idol, the ""lord of the flies"" from which the book takes its name. (The expression is a literal translation of the name Beelzebub, and ""the Beast"" can also be a euphemism for the Devil). The boys' descent from innocence into savagery can be seen as symbolic of the Fall of Man, although other, secular interpretations are also possible. One of the boys, the gentle, mystical Simon, has been seen as a Christ-figure. .If the book is read either as a political or as a religious allegory, then it is easy to see Ralph as its hero and Jack as the villain. Read on a psychological level, however, the issue is less clear-cut. Ralph and Jack symbolise two different attitudes to life, and two different styles of leadership. Ralph and his close friend Piggy represent the rational, the harmonious, the logical and the rule-based; in short, they represent the civilisation which the boys have left behind. Jack and his gang represent the irrational, the will to power, the instinctive and the atavistic. Under normal circumstances, it is the first set of principles which would seem preferable to most people, but of course the circumstances in which the boys find themselves are far from normal.Adult civilisation has broken down even more comprehensively than does the boys' attempt to replicate it on the island- we learn that nuclear weapons have been used in the war. The boys, attempting to fell from that breakdown of are confronted not only with their own physical needs but also with all the terrors which assailed their primitive ancestors- terror of the dark, of the unknown, of hunger, of solitude, of dangerous wild beasts. In, these circumstances the irrationality advocated by Jack may answer their emotional needs more adequately than the rationality advocated by Ralph and Piggy, which is why he succeeds and they fail. Seen in this light, the boys' reversion to the more primitive instincts of human nature can be seen as a response to the collapse of civilisation rather than the cause of that collapse, a valuable survival mechanism in extremis rather than pure villainy.There is not enough space in this review to discuss all the many levels of meaning, including Golding's complex and multi-layered use of symbolism and imagery, in the novel, so I will content myself with the three aspects set out above, the political, the religious and the psychological. This is one of those books in which you can find more with each reading- in my view one of the hallmarks of a great work of literature. I was surprised to learn that ""Lord of the Flies"" was actually the author's first novel- surely one of the best first novels ever published."

Lord of the Flies is brilliantly written and chocked full of symbolism. Hell, its probably really worth reading too, but certianly not for entertainment. Goldings ultimate message at the end of the book is that the human race is hopeless and detructive and that civilazation means nothing and thats simply not true. mabye i'm a wimp but i like to read uplifting things that make you feel good.

I agree with the message he is trying to send out to the readers because people are scared of what they don;t know and sometimes handle it in a crazy behavior. I think he handled the characters very well because you can see how different they are from each other and how much evil they they have in themselves.

1571,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,A28ZOZJU5A30Z0,Sean K,4/8,5.0,1156982400,Law vs. Anarchy,"A compelling adventure tale, ""Lord of the Rings"" succeeds in telling a story of the dark instincts inherent in the human condition. Although we are conditioned for a civilized society, Golding makes the compelling argument that if left to our own devices, we will revert back to our primitive roots, one where survival and savagery triumph over order and rules.Golding's tale could be described as an allegory of law vs. anarchy, and civilization vs. savagery. After a harrowing escape and crash landing on a deserted Pacific isle, a group of English boys, escaping a cataclysmic atomic war with the Communists, quickly organize into a rudimentary society, with Ralph as their elected leader. Ralph symbolizes the leadership and good of society. Piggy, the corpulent advisor to Ralph, represents the intellect and common sense in society. Jack, Ralph's nemesis, represents the corrupt power-mongers who use fear to rule their minions. Simon, an enigmatic but sensible boy, represents the kind and charitable in society, and proves a martyr in the end. And finally, Roger, sadistic and inhuman, symbolizes the pure evil that plagues society.As the boys descend further into savagery, their desire to be rescued becomes non-existent. Instead, they are content in their animalistic rituals, and become enamored of violence and adrenalin-fueled hunting expeditions. Their concern for others collapses, as Jack becomes the tyrannical leader of a rival tribe, and eventually all succumb to him. Although they arrived on the island as innocent victims of a horrific war, they lose their innocence on the island as evil creeps up from the recesses of their soul. Even if they were to return to society, they will never regain their innocence.Although Golding tells a moral tale, there is no shortage of action. From the chaos of the initial plane crash, to the fear of a ""beast"", to the final heart-pounding hunt of Ralph, ""Lord of the Rings"" delivers a chilling and exciting tale. I honestly cannot find any downside to this book. This is a superb read and is highly enjoyable."

When I actually began to think about it, I realized how relevant Golding's work is to our species. We are driven by agression, or the id (represented by Jack), and without morals (ego and superego-Ralph, the rescue ship and Piggy) we would become like total monsters. Not only does the story convey this point, but it does so in a way which is actually interesting, which few of the writers of &quot;classics&quot; can do. Brilliant work, Mr. Golding."

The book begins with British boys all of decent and educated backgrounds stranded on a island with no adults. In the book, the boys are initially led by a sensitive, smart, and logic driven Ralph and a competitive, ambitious, and instinct driven Jack. The group of boys initially all have meetings where their opinions are regulated by a conch found by Ralph and Piggy, Ralph's assistant. Gradually, the delicate friendship between Ralph and Jack breaks, and rivalry, savagery arise. The boys split up into two groups, each an enemy to the other, and conducts actions even to the most brutal degree, murder. As superstitions and fears arouse, the boys created a beast out of their own uneven emotions which became the centerpiece of the story and at the same time an excuse to all actions as more and more, the boys shift their blame to the imaginary beast.Everything in the book possesses great symbolic meaning. Piggy, who throughout the book was Ralph's assistant, represents society's intellituals, who despite their brilliant minds and common sense, are condemned for their lack of expression and appeal. Ralph represents leadership and justice, and the beauty to the human nature while Jack in contrast, shows the instinctive beast that dwells in all humans. The conch, which at first was in effect during meetings, represents democracy and the freedom of speech for only with the possession of it can a boy speak. The beast, the ultimate focus of the book, is a creation of mankind's own fears and insecurities. The book is brutally beautiful; it reveals to us a side of human nature that many thought was nearly impossible and also, the delicate exterior that we call civilization."

It is a fantastic story of a group of school boys stranded on an island. However, with close reading an allegorical underlying meaning surfaces. Golding masterfully creates a miniature society with the boys and proceeds to depict it as corrupt and depraved, using Jack as a violent and tyrannical politician-like figure. When my english teacher first informed my ninth grade class that we would be reading this potentially boring book, I groaned along with my peers. However, within a few pages, I was enthralled. I could not get enough of the lovable and heroic Ralph, the endearing complaints of Piggy, the epilictic visions of the ill-fated Simon, or the evil manipulations of the nefarious Jack and his hunting hooligans.

1582,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/0,5.0,922924800,Excellent Premise,"A reviewer wrote that the fact that most of the boys turned into savages was unrealistic. On the contrary, I thiunk it was the most ingenious and realistic part of the novel. The premise that makes them turn a bunch of stuck-up, snotty British prep school kids turn into savages is one that's also been preached by Freud, Darwin, and Anthony Burgess (the author of A Clockwork Orange, another great novel). It goes as follows: human beings are simply highly evolved animals. Although we may be much smarter than dogs, monkeys, or lions, we have the same animal instincts and tendencies that they have. Also, contrary to what religion may tell you, we're both with no sense of right or wrong. Some of us, such as Ralph and Piggy, as we grow older and develop free will, develop a sense of right and wrong. However, in the case of many others, such as Jack and Roger, who seemed harmless at the begining of the novel, no moral sense of right and wrong is ever developed, even though the given is usually unaware of this. The only reason that the such people are &quot;kept in line&quot; is because society trains them that way. Thus, when the barriers of society are gone, their amoral animal nature returns, as shown in Lord of the Flies. This book proved that Golding was both an excellent weriter and a brilliant thinker."
1583,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/0,3.0,938736000,I think The Lord of the Flies was mostly boring.,The most interesting parts in the book were when the boys saw the parachutist on top of the mountain and thought he was a monster.

I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government, such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to ""just have fun"" were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example, not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family, and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English, and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world, the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly, the overwhelming desire for meat, which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans, is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh, Piggy, Jack, and Simon."

Young boys can be imaginative and insiteful, and they can be mean, cruel, and even a little sadistic. This book brims with themes and implications, almost EVERY LINE of the book displaying some theme or other. Here is a story of survival , of loyalty, of standing for what's right, of good vs. evil, and of the realities of a modern life. Yes, that's right. Not only does the boys' reversion to savagery hold implications of a world without law or order, but we also see that such a world is beyond so many of us.

Well its been over 5 years since I last looked at it and decieded that it was time to finish it. And i've been happy with my decision ever since.The book is about 20 or so british children (mostly under the age of 13) who are stranded on an uncharted island with nothing but the clothes on there backs. There plane was damaged durring a storm and basicly crashed on the island. The oldest of the survivors is the main character ""Ralph"" who becomes the appointed leader. Ralph's main goal is to get of the island alive. A goal that was dire to the survivors at first but over time it becomes less and less important. Ralph becomes over thrown by ""Jack"" another boy his age who feels that meat is more important than a fire signal. Jack's charater is sort of wild and will go to any measure to gain power over the younger boys. Jack's test of power is measured when he finially kills a pig to prove that he could do it. And as time goes on, his power to kill spreads so that anyone who defies him will be delt with or killed.The only thing that I didnt like about the book was the ending. I would have liked to know more about what happened to the boys mentally after they were rescued. Like were they able to cope with what they had become which was almost like animals.

1590,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/0,3.0,872208000,"Good idea, bad development","When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book, I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like, but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They &quot;build&quot; their own little society, with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well, the setting sounds really cool, doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book, and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it, I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great, but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover, when trying to show us a bit of what is our history, and an insight into the development of our civilizations, Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact, there are no women on the island (or, well, no little girl to fall in love with). And thus, no Queen to fight for. Another example : no power behind the throne. It's just a story about survival, fisrt against Nature, and then of course against humankind (here, other children).I think that's why on one hand I loved this book, because of the setting, the ideas, and also the story. But on the other hand, this work is only a draft, not really complete and definitive (ok, no work is definitive, if you see what I mean). Sometimes when I read a book, I feel that it is the _ultimate_ novel about a subject, and I felt that for _The old mand and the sea_ (Hemingway) or _The Plague_ (Camus). This book is a good one, worth reading, but I'm sure someone can write a far better novel on this topic, and that's why I think it only deserves a 6 rating."

It repeatedly reoccurs throughout our pop culture, in television and film, etc. I am not sure if Darwinism came before or after this book, but the principal idea is what happens when several human beings have to survive on a remote island far removed from society. The book begins with a plane crash of school children, and the surviving children attempt to establish some form of order which quickly disintegrates. What happens from there is indicative of William Golding's impression of the true, primal nature of humanity. Definitely a classic, which everyone should read.

1595,B0007GZPJI,Lord of the flies,,,,0/1,5.0,1052265600,Lord of the Flies Review for Kelly English,"Lord of the Flies, lucidly written by William Golding, tells of the terror and adventure that befalls a misfortunate group of young boys. The story takes place in the future at the outbreak World War III, which the author predicts will occur. The first page of the novel describes two of the main characters, Ralph and Piggy, exploring a jungle on the island where they had just crash-landed, discussing their plane crash. Ralph, Piggy, and a plane full of other children are headed to an orphanage-like facility when their jet goes down on an uninhabited, tropical island. For the rest of the novel, the fate of the surviving boys will become the author&#65533;s main focus.Ralph and Piggy gather the boys on the island. Ralph, being a natural leader, creates basic rules for the children to follow and a strategy for survival and rescue. Immediately, one of the older boys, Jack, is highly confrontational with Ralph and his authority. Ralph&#65533;s main priority as chosen leader is to build a signal fire that will continuously produce smoke in order to get the attention of passing ships. Ralph and Piggy do their best to maintain order, law, and a functioning community. Jack and many others no longer wish to be part of Ralph&#65533;s tribe, with all of the rules, jobs, and responsibilities. Jack becomes chief of this own tribe and incessantly harasses Ralph. The two warring clans are forced to deal with one another and well as a mysterious beast that lives on top of the island&#65533;s mountain. Throughout the book, all of the characters face both external and internal conflicts.In the first chapter of Lord of the Flies the setting of the story is meticulously described. While reading Golding&#65533;s portrayal of the island&#65533;s climate, I almost felt sweaty and fearful of poisonous jungle creatures. Golding is an expert in the art of showing the idea he is expressing, not literally telling the reader.&#65533;[The boy with fair hair] had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him&#65533;the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily around the creepers and broken trunks&#65533; (page 7).I extremely enjoyed reading this novel. It is psychologically fascinating, providing a rarely discussed insight to the savagery of the human mind. This is not a light read; rather it is a book to seriously read two or more times in order to fully appreciate it.There is a clear connection between Lord of the Flies past and current tribal warfare, political factions, even the business world. Another similarity between this book and reality can be found in adolescent social situations. In many schools several group leaders emerge and compete for students to follow them. When this struggle occurs in schools, it is of course not as violent or blatantly aggressive. It also does not result in deaths, with the exception of a few rare occasions.William Golding&#65533;s Lord of the Flies is timeless and a tremendous read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the human mind, or is just looking for a book that stays with you long after you have put the novel down."

Of course, objective individuals are not the target audience. If you are a Christian, then this book will most likely confirm that you are indeed the best, the smartest, and the only truly righteous in the only way such a thing can be confirmed: Through rationalization, circular logic, and outright self-delusion. The misogyny and blatant hatred imbued in this dogma-filled tripe is offensive. It is interesting to an objective person only as an examination of self-delusion."

It is simple to understand, and offers a lot of decent information for those not of the Christian faith. The one issue I seriously had with this book is the enduring belief that women must submit to men (first their fathers, and then their husbands), period, without considering a few important facts.To begin, ""women"" were married off (at best) to men twice their age. Of course they should listen to their husbands, they're mere teenagers! Being married off at this age was only logical, since the average woman was broken and worn by the age of 30; men can reproduce at any age, as long as they still have some level of libido. Furthermore, if anyone has problems with these girls being married off to men twice their age, would anyone feel any better if she were married off to another teenager?I didn't think so.I am a Christian, and I prefer to look for logic behind the words of the gospel rather than follow it blindly.

I also think that I probably enjoyed this book even more because it was written by someone from another time. Although it is intended for a general audience it isn't exactly a light read.

1611,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A11C8K6ISAP90K,Krista,3/3,5.0,1179532800,Challenge to Christians and Concise Rationale for Atheists,"C.S. Lewis is arguably the premier apologetic writer of the 20th century, his case for the Christian faith made even more powerful by his former atheism. ""Mere Christianity"" may be more important now for the modern audience than it was back in 1952. Lewis is one of my favorite writers and this book is a definitive classic, a masterpiece. It is a brilliant rationale: encouraging and challenging alike. Simply put, the book invites the reader to become a ""New Man."" In a warm, conversational tone, Lewis addresses the Big questions in four parts: morality as God's law; what Christians believe; Christian behavior, such as the cardinal virtues and problem of sin; and the theological doctrine of Christianity, all of which are concerns to living this ""new"" life, the life of a Christian. As stated in Matthew 16:25 of the NIV Bible, ""For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it."" Lewis takes this idea -- which looks abstract to a non-Christian -- and illustrates, in concrete terms, the rationale behind the Christian faith. Why must Christians give up their ""lives"" -- their ""selves"" -- to come closer to Christ? It is a choice at odds with the humanistic society we live in. Christians have been warned of this struggle and of the importance to adhere to the age-old truths in the Bible: ""Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world."" (Romans 12:2). The journey has been described as a daily walk: with each step one is either closer to Christ or further away. As Lewis puts it, ""Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different than it was before."" For the Christian, that ""something different"" looks more like Christ and less like us. The importance of this idea cannot be overstated for a modern, cynical, self-sufficient and self-important -- and largely secular -- society. Particularly powerful is the writing on the dichotomy of good and evil--how morality (right and wrong) appears to be a subjective issue, or as atheists like to claim, ""common sense."" Not everyone appears to need Christ, at least not while things are going splendidly. As Lewis sadly surmises, ""If you have sound nerves and intelligence and health and popularity and a good upbringing, you are likely to be quite satisfied with your character as it is. ""Why drag God into it?"" you may ask."" Why indeed? This book may inspire you to find out."
1612,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1Q1NMBEFM87YZ,Gary Scott,176/354,1.0,1028678400,Mere Stupidity,"While this is often held up as a paragon of clear, concise, and convincing apologetics, Mere Christianity is logically weak, filled with antiquated views, and ignorant of some basic social science.To begin with, Lewis likes to raise objections to his arguments, imaging that these are the very things a non-believer might say in response to his claims. However, most of these objections are petty and insignificant, easily refuted and not anything a serious non-Christian would raise as an objection.For example, he likes to use the Lord/Lunatic/Liar argument for the divinity of Jesus (see Book 2 Chapter 3). It goes as follows: Jesus claimed to be God. Either he was indeed God, or he was a lunatic for claiming it, or he was an outright liar. This argument is a non-argument for at least two reasons. As Lewis argues, ""It seems obvious to me that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend"" (Book 2 Chapter 4). It seems obvious to Lewis, but not to me.To begin with, there are more than three possible explanations here. Perhaps he never did claim to be God. Or perhaps he was misquoted in the Gospels. On the other hand, we can't so easily dismiss the lunatic or liar possibility as Lewis likes to think. We have to remember that Jesus lied at least once. ""'Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.' After saying this, he remained in Galilee. But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in private"" (John 7.8-10 RSV). In addition, the lunatic label, while somewhat un-PC, might indeed fit, for Jesus once cursed a fig tree because it wasn?t bearing fruit, though it wasn't in season.He also makes the bizarre argument in Book 2 Chapter 2 that Christianity is real because it's too bizarre to have been made up. In other words, it's true because it's weird. I guess that makes all science fiction stories true as well.In arguing for basic theism, Lewis makes a little linguistic switch and then makes something out of it. He begins by using the word ""law"" descriptively (i.e., gravity) and the switches to a prescriptive use of ""law (i.e., morality). He then makes much of this fact without acknowledging that that in fact is all he's done. It's a language trick, not in any way a proof of god.Not only is Lewis book illogical, it is steeped in antiquated ideas. He subscribes to the idea of constant societal, moral progress (i.e., we as a society are becoming more and more morally enlightened) a la Comte even though this claim has widely been disputed by both historians and sociologists. He also shows an ignorance of basic sociology, and seems never to have read a single work of Durkheim (who could easily explain whence comes this internal ?moral law? that Lewis basis so much of his argument on).A good example of his sociological ignorance comes when discussing the nature of Jesus? sacrifice in Book 2 Chapter 4. He makes the analogy that Jesus? sacrifice was not as much receiving punishment as paying a debt we all owe to God. That?s fine and good until we stop to think about what ?debt? is. In short, it is a societal construction. A debt is simply saying ?I owe you money.? What happens if we don?t pay it? According to nature, nothing. We won?t drop dead of a heart attack or break out in a rash. Instead, society allows the person owed to punish the debtor if the debt is not paid. One could easily imagine a society where there was no concept of debt. In this society, you can give money to your friend, but you cannot expect or even desire for the friend to pay it back.Another example of antiquated ideas is his sexism. Describing the Christian marriage, Lewis says, ?There must be something unnatural about the rule of wives over husbands, because the wives themselves are half ashamed of it and despise the husbands whom they rule? (Book 3 Chapter 6). Not only is that a sexist statement, but, like most such statements, it is a sweeping generalization that presumes to see into the heart of thousands of women whom Lewis might describe as ruling over their husbands.In short, Mere Christianity is a disappointment. It offers no new insight into Christianity and is in fact chock full of logical fallacies and ignorance. Any educated non-believer will remain unconvinced."
1613,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,,,2/4,5.0,935625600,Christianity in a Nutshell,"Lewis starts off sharing strong evidence that there is a God. However, I was amazed at how Prof. Lewis included only what is essential for being a Christian. He catered to all the Christian Denominations - an immense task. I also enjoyed his many alegories which explain the virtues of a Chritian, and how one should act. Forgive, Love, Give, Faith, etc. If you're interested in what Christianity is, I'd highly recomend this book."
1614,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1RJD10TTI568L,"Pieter Uys ""Toypom""",6/8,5.0,1104624000,Deeply moving and thought-provoking,"In the foreword it is explained that this book is not one of philosophical musings but a work of oral literature addressed to a people at war. It was originally broadcast by the BBC from 1942 to 1944, hence the gripping metaphors like the image of the earth as enemy-occupied territory. Mere Christianity is a book of plain but moving language.In Book One: Right and Wrong As a Clue To The Meaning Of The Universe, Lewis looks at the law of human nature (inherent knowledge of right and wrong), certain objections, the reality of the law and that which lies behind the law. Here he discusses the materialist, the life-force and the religious views of life.Book Two is a discussion on what Christians believe, in terms of the aforementioned occupied territory, a coming invasion, the penitent, and the practical conclusion. This section also deals with pantheism, dualism, free will, the divinity of Christ and God's intentions with the world.Book Three investigates Christian behaviour, in terms of the cardinal virtues, social and personal morality, morality and psychology, marriage, forgiveness, the great sin (narcissistic pride; in this regard, please also readPeople of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evilby M Scott Peck), and what charity, hope and faith really mean.Book 4 is a captivating explanation of the doctrine of the trinity. I found this part very interesting and sometimes deeply moving. Lewis speculates on the nature of time, the nature of man and the nature of God, as the Father the source, the Son an emanation of the source and the Holy Spirit as the spirit of love between Father and Son. Lewis explains what he thinks is the process whereby the individual receives a higher nature. This change in consciousness (infusion of the Holy Spirit) leads to a transcendence of the mortal nature by transforming the individual into a child of the divine.He argues convincingly for personalities in God and God as the ultimate personality. I found this very illuminating, also in light of having recently read the books byDeborah Whitehouseand Alan Anderson on Process New Thought, especially their view of the personhood of God and panentheism as it emerges from the work ofAlfred North Whitehead.Mere Christianity is a most memorable work that expresses ideas that are relevant to our times. It is a very refreshing expression of a personal Christian belief system that could serve as a strong antidote to the dictatorship of dogma or the staid boredom often associated with 20th century religion in the West. Deeply illuminating, Lewis' words I am sure make many people reconsider important ideas that they had taken for granted.I am not sure how close Lewis came to the truth in every respect, but much in his vision is inspiring, noble and infused with a sense of logic and common sense. Lewis' writing has an uplifting effect on the spirit. I recommend Mere Christianity to all people of faith and those in search of meaning. One might not ultimately agree with everything, but the thoughts expressed here certainly make you think."
1615,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A18PIHM4WCNNP5,Colin Moneymaker,3/6,5.0,1038960000,"A Review of C.S. Lewis's ""Mere Christianity""","From 1942 to 1944 C. S. Lewis did a series of radio broadcasts on Christian Faith. These broadcasts were then made into a book, Mere Christianity. A guideline to why and what Christian's believe, it gives an intellectual and philosophical understanding of Christianity. It is an excellent series of subjects starting with the ""Meaning of the Universe,"" where Lewis takes a systematic approach involving right and wrong as a key to understanding the Universe. As the book continues it follows a path in which Lewis gives insight towards more technical and precise variables of Christianity such as faith and forgiveness. He concludes the book with a large section on the ""Doctrines of the Trinity,"" plastered with metaphors and deep explanations concerning the world around us, rather than each of us as an individual personality. However, this book is a conquest for the truth, it does not have the final answer. If one finds a final answer for their spiritual beliefs in this book, they are contradicting what they have read. A final answer can only be found within one's self.Concerning the logical soundness of this book, C. S. Lewis demonstrates an almost uncanny ability to prove religious arguments with reason on a consistent basis. And to make it even better, he builds upon each subject that he proves. This is best noted in his explanations of the universe, where he concludes that there is a one God that created everything. However, there are obvious fallacies concerning the validity of Lewis's arguments. Although a great scholar and philosopher, he was once an atheist, which gives us the hint that he might not be such a great authority. And if he is a die-hard Christian, we must not overlook the fact that he is biased. There are very few instances where counter views, and arguments are presented. However, this book was written from a series of lectures during World War 2 where Lewis was given the task to explain the truth in Christianity, not prove it. Also, a large majority of the book relates to religious presumptions, which don't go with the flow of structural logic, but when dealing with religion improvable presumptions are inevitable. However, these are all minor technicalities that have little affect on the real meaning of the book. For Christians and non-Christians alike, truth prevails over faith. We must make sure we understand our beliefs before we completely conform to them. Faith and no margin for evidence results in blind ignorance.As a service to society, Lewis created a structural manual describing Christian values, and their affect on humanity. For the person looking for answers concerning their spirituality, this book is a gateway to finding them. It presents the reader with an opportunity to comprehend why Gods word is true. It also encourages questioning, and not only enlightens, but inspires reason. Summarizing the review is a quote that demonstrates the attitude of C.S. Lewis, ""In religion, as in war and everything else, comfort is the one thing you cannot get by looking for it. If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth - only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and, in the end, despair."""

1618,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",37/37,5.0,1129852800,Superb collection,"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.This collection contains several of C.S. Lewis' classic works (although it is not in fact a complete collection of all his writings, not even of all his non-fiction writings). It contains the following works: 'Mere Christianity', 'The Screwtape Letters', 'The Great Divorce', 'The Problem of Pain', 'Miracles', 'A Grief Observed', plus 'The Abolition of Man'. It does provide an excellent survey of Lewis' theology, ethics, and general outlook on life. I will highlight two of the selections that show the different ways Lewis approaches things.For the first example, the book 'Mere Christianity' looks at beliefs, both from a 'natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, 'When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the `leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the `new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.'Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - 'The Case for Christianity', 'Christian Behaviour', and 'Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made.On the other hand, Lewis can write in ways that are intensely personal and reflective. This is true of the book 'A Grief Observed'. This was drawn out of his personal experience with his wife, Joy. C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a 'confirmed bachelor', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, ""I am at peace with God."" 'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss. Through all of this, he took pains to recount what he was going through, that it might not be lost, that it might benefit others, that there might be some small part of his love for Joy that would last forever.I hope it shall.This is a wonderful collection."

The reader is being guided step by step to comprehend the essences of Christianity. As a lively adaptation of this serious series of radio talks during the second world war when enmity was the core mentality, Lewis has successfully touched the heart of his readers with love and humility. He is particularly keen on giving his readers freedom not to read a certain chapter if they think the topic is irrelevant to them, thus making them even more eager to find out what is irrelevant. He also admits that some of his ideas are just guesses and some of his illustrations are limited, thus making him even more sincere and likable.

Lewis' works have been compiled into collections since their initial publications, this particular collection might be one of the best available at the moment. That is, this collection might offer a comparatively larger bang for one's buck. Each of the titles contained within this single volume are more than worth their weight in gold, making the collection as a whole priceless. One should realize, however, that if the collective work is approached as one large, continuous reading, it might be seen as a tremendous undertaking. As large as the actual book might be, one should not be intimidated by its size, and feel comfortable tackling each of the separate texts as if it were independent from the larger collection if not only to avoid rushing in an attempt to reach its end.To avoid an unnecessarily long review, one might be best served, if at all interested, to examine the reviews available for each of the individual titles contained within this compilation. Beyond this it should be mentioned that while these are appropriately dubbed Lewis' signature classics, much of his work is omitted from this collection. A few additional suggestions if one is interested in this author are The Four Loves, Surprised by Joy, Letters to Malcolm, and God in the Dock among many, many others. Again, this collection is a legitimate bargain considering the wealth of knowledge it contains and the comparative price of purchasing each separately...or never inquiring at all."
1623,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1HAREI9MW1UTH,Arno Arrak,32/78,1.0,1157241600,Moral Law Is Naturally Selected,"This book has its origins in a series of wartime lectures that the author gave over BBC in 1943 which were later collated into three booklets and finally rendered into the present volume. The author, who says he was once an atheist, fancies that he can convert others into Christianity with his pop talk about the ""Moral Law"" or ""The Law of Right and Wrong"" he pulls out of himself. God embedded a knowledge of it into human nature he says and to him it is as real as the laws of physics except that we can disobey it. The first five chapters are devoted to this Moral Law and then he goes on to some basic Christian ethics. Included are the four cardinal virtues -- Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude -- as well as the three theological virtues -- Faith, Hope and Charity. His defense of God for allowing much evil in the world is that God gave us free will and we ourselves messed up our lives. That is a real copout for a supposedly all-good, omnipotent being. If the Nazi and Communist mass murders leave him unmoved, what chance is there that he will interfere about the woes of an individual human being? Although not married Lewis lived with an older woman (mother of his fallen comrade) for more than a decade. In discussing Christian marriage, however, he speaks of ""the monstrosity of intercourse outside the marriage."" and goes on to suggest that ""divorce is something like cutting up a living body."" Also, in marriage, ""Christian wives promise to obey their husband"" and ""...the man is said to be the `head'."" For those already converted or on the verge of being converted all that sermonizing does have a morale-boosting quality, for it tells them just what they want to hear. And what does conversion do for you? ""Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect - perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, and immortality.The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment."" In plain language, you have to die first in order to collect your just rewards as a Christian. Or, like it says in ""The Preacher and the Slave,"" ""...you get pie in the sky when you die."" However, Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, read the book when a preacher whose advice he sought handed it to him and became a famous convert. You really have to want to believe badly and close your eyes to all that unreality which is part of the package to accept such delusions but Collins manages to do it. He in particular should know that modern science has found the physical basis for that moral instinct upon which Lewis builds his case. Quite simply, we are a social species and evolution has provided us with social instincts necessary to hold society together. In ""The Science of Good and Evil"" Michael Shermer has worked out some consequences of evolutionary ethics. Michael Gazzaniga, speaking of brain scans in ""The Ethical Brain,"" points out that whenever a person is willing to act on a moral belief the emotional part of his brain has become active while considering the moral question at hand. In ""Moral Minds"" Marc D. Hauser introduces the idea of an evolved moral grammar, analogous to that which we possess for language and of which we are not aware of but which is capable of rapid ethical decision making. Physical damage to some parts of the forebrain, as happened to Phineas Gage in 1848 and to others since, will destroy all moral inhibitions we have. The latter fact is proof that it is a properly functioning brain, not some spiritual essence that is responsible for moral behavior. Further proof comes from the observation that autists lack emotions, including any sort of moral sense as a result of their brain defects. All this of course is knowledge Lewis could not have had but which Collins should have been aware of. Atheism is quickly dismissed by Lewis as being ""too simple"" (which says nothing about its validity). And his treatment of evolution is equally cavalier: ""By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us."" This materialist view is not for him for he prefers the religious view -- the view that behind the universe is something like a mind which is conscious and has purposes. And one of its purposes is to produce creatures like itself that have minds, which means us. He does not tell us how he came to know all this or why we should take his word for it and simply says that trying to disprove it by ""science in the ordinary sense"" (whatever that may mean) is impossible. Further reading reveals that not only is his science out of date but that he also makes a joke of it: ""Every scientific statement...in the long run really means something like, "" I pointed the telescope at such and such part of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,"" or, ""I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so."" My mind simply boggles at the legions of faithful who lap up this nonsense and give him five stars. Lifelong indoctrintion easily overcomes the few weeks of studying evolution they get in high school and gives them no chance to consider the alternative. Lewis himself belongs to that ilk of British intellectuals ignorant of science who drove C. P. Snow into distraction over the two cultures he was to write about later."

Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at ""intellectuals"". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940's speculative science fiction feel. Lewis' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics. Readers that enjoy this may also like The Screwtape Letters and the Great Divorce also from Lewis."

Lewis does an effective job of exploring the moral argument and then moves forward into presuppositional arguments. You may or may not agree with Lewis -- many fundamentalists struggle with his positions, as of course do atheists -- but anyone interested in questions of God's existence and nature will do himself a favor in reading this book.Discussing his own journey from atheism to Christianity, Lewis relates: ""... in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -- in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless -- I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality -- namely my idea of justice -- was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning."""
1636,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1VA170GUYGTB,Paula L. Craig,24/47,2.0,1142121600,Christianity is great--if you ignore all the problems,"Lewis states that he wrote this book with the idea of convincing atheists. As an atheist myself, I had heard Lewis was the best Christian apologist there is. If these arguments are the best Christianity can come up with, atheism doesn't have much to worry about.Lewis takes the approach in this book of focusing on all the doctrines the largest branches of Christianity have in common, deliberately ignoring controversial issues. The problem with this is that the endless proliferation of Christian sects is one of the strongest arguments against Christianity. If Christians themselves can't agree on what Christ really taught or what God wants from us, what chance is there of convincing atheists--or for that matter Muslims or Hindus? Lewis says that as far as people who have never heard of Christ, we just don't know what God has arranged for them, so we should leave it up to God. This strikes me as an intellectual cop-out. Part of the reason atheism makes sense to me is that atheism has intellectual coherence. Atheism doesn't have to twist itself into knots over the problem of how God can love all his children but leave most of them without knowledge of him, or how God can be good when the world around us often seems filled with evil and injustice.Lewis claims that our ideas of goodness and justice, which are common to all cultures, mean there must be a God. I disagree. I don't see any reason why evolution could not produce human beings having a sense of right and wrong. To some extent, a sense of right and wrong is a necessity for social animals. Chimpanzees complain when something they have worked to get is stolen from them. Wolves reject another wolf from the pack if he doesn't behave as a wolf should. Why would human beings be different?Lewis also argues that the fact that humans hunger to find meaning in life means that there must be a God. I agree that humans have a tendency to be discontented and hunger for more. But what evidence is there such discontent could not evolve in human beings? A certain amount of discontent could have benefitted our ancestors by keeping them always trying to better their circumstances, instead of getting complacent. As a former Christian myself, I also know that Christianity doesn't necessarily bring contentedness. Some atheists are indeed miserable people, but many are happy. As far as my own life, I would call it generally pretty good. The Christians of my acquaintance don't seem to have more meaningful or happy lives on average than the atheists.Lewis has a reputation for being a logician. In my opinion, much of his ""logic"" is absurd. For example, Lewis spends a lot of time on the Trinity and how the three persons are connected. He talks about the Son streaming forth from the Father, and that this has always been so, etc. This just makes me laugh. And Lewis thinks that atheism makes no sense?If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible.As far as the book itself, Lewis is a fine writer who is never boring. For that reason I give the book two stars. If you're interested in basic Christianity, this is a good introduction. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's ""The Long Emergency."" For a defense of atheism and the naturalistic worldview,I would suggest Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World"" or Taner Edis' ""The Ghost in the Universe.""I read ""Mere Christianity"" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"

Instead, the book assumes that you have already accepted Christianity and want to know where to go from there.Some of the arguments are VERY weak (ex. The universe must have meaning because we have a concept of meaning. It's like if we lived in a world of all darkness we would not have a concept of light) The light and dark part are true because we can only see things as light and dark. But we have a concept of meaning in almost everything that we do. Not just the universe.Also some of the thoughts are a bit dated (Couples should stay together because the woman must have sacrificed her career for raising children).For someone looking for a book that will ""prove"" or ""convince"" him or her that there is a god, this book is not for you. It presents too many theories as fact and uses them as a basis for all its arguments. The non-believer should look else where for a compelling argument of the other side."

I am ashamed to say that I never read this book until recently. I should have since it is by many considered to be a halmark of Christian appologetic literature. Lewis' conversational style is appealing and make this small book a fairly easy read. I do have to admit that the first part of the book is brilliant. It is an extremely articulate arguement for the law of God being written on our hearts. No doubt it will not convince those who are philosophically opposed to the very idea but for those who are willing to read what God has written it should be very powerful. There are times that the arguements flowed to the point that I had to reread parts. I actually feel that while his conversational style makes for an easy read it at times convolutes the logic which is generally (though not always) sound once you go back and track it down.Book 2 (What Christians Believe) was fairly good but I have to admit that there were parts of Book 3 (Christian Behavior)that I found to be tedious. Book 4 (Beyond Presonality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine fo the Trinity) was pretty hit and miss parts were brilliant and others were lacking.What this book impressed uponme the most is that despite the accolades we need to read everything with a critial eye. As, I have stated parts of this book are brilliant and worthy of study. But, at the same time we need to recognize the deficiencies in Lewis' Theology. His discomfort with the exclusivity of Christ is hinted at in this book and expanded in others. But, also we need to be carely about the very idea of Mere Christianity. He makes a great effort to be theologically inclusive in this book and in the Preface Lewis even draws the analogy of Christianity being a large Hall and the different parts of Christianity being different doors leading out of the hall. He ackowledges that when we seek to open the door we need to seek which door is true but he says his purpose is only to lead us to the Hall. This way of thinking resonates strongly today. But, if one door is true then another door may not be true and that is deffinately something we need to consider. The discussions of Mere Christianity have their place but they must not replace the discussions of our Creeds. Souls often hang in the balance."
1648,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1Z0LLO7WEKMUW,"Randle Rector ""Randy""",6/10,5.0,1071792000,Scarecrows Are For The Birds,"Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis is a book I consider must reading for everyone. You've probably noticed that I have given it five stars, and from this you may conclude that I am a believer (and you would be right). However, I am not saying that you have to agree with this book. Just get it, read it, reread it, and ponder it. One reading is not enough. The reason I say this is that we all have a tendency to read what we expect a writer to say into what he actually does say.Many critics of Lewis often set up &quot;straw man&quot; arguments. They read some flawed logic into his words and then easily knock it down. For example, Lewis said, &quot;Reality is something you could not have guessed. This is one of the reasons I believe in Christianity. It is a religion you could not have guessed.&quot; The context of these statements shows that Lewis meant that reality has a curious twist of &quot;oddness&quot; about it, and this is one of the reasons he is a believer; Christianity echoes that curious twist of oddness. Please note, he said &quot;one of the reasons&quot;, by which he meant &quot;in conjunction with other reasons&quot; that he has given. Some say he meant that the world is complex, Christianity is complex, therefore it must be true. They then demolish this straw man by pointing out that all this really means is that a person is free to attend the most complicated religion of their choice. That is not what Lewis said. It is always a good idea to check the context when interpreting any statement.&quot;Circular reasoning&quot; can also be a staw man argument. For example, Lewis is supposed to have said that one believes what the New Testament says because Jesus is the Son of God and one believes He is the Son of God because of the Bible's description of His life. If Lewis actually implied that, it would be circular reasoning and worthy of being discounted. But did he? I have read Mere Christianity several times and I never got that Lewis was saying one belives what the New Testament says &quot;because Jesus is the Son of God.&quot; Lewis says the New Testament is reliable reporting, and gives other reasons for believing this, but Jesus being the Son of God is that which is to be demonstrated.These are just two examples of many straw man arguments based on not paying attention to what C.S. Lewis actually does say in Mere Christianity. Maybe if you get it, read it, reread it, and ponder it, you will find a really valid argument against it. Until then, don't jump to conclusions or assume you already know what this book is all about. I will try to do the same."

Lewis's radio broadcasts in England during World War II: The Case for Christianity, Christian Behaviour, and Beyond Personality. Here is the outline for Mere Christianity:Book I. RIGHT AND WRONG AS A CLUE TO THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE. 1.) The Law of Human Nature (Where Lewis begins by saying, &quot;Every one has heard people quarrelling,&quot; then goes on to talk about the moral law people appeal to when they argue.) 2.) Some Objections 3.)The Reality of the Law 4.) What Lies Behind the Law 5.) We Have Cause to Be UneasyBook II. WHAT CHRISTIANS BELIEVE 1.) The Rival Conceptions of God 2.) The Invasion 3.) The Shocking Alternative (where Lewis presents his claims that Jesus of Nazareth was either God incarnate, a liar, or a lunatic, but not merely a good moral teacher.) 4.) The Perfect Penitent 5.) The Practical ConclusionBook III. CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOUR 1.) The Three Parts of Morality 2.) The &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot; (Lewis discusses Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude) 3.) Social Morality 4.) Morality and Psychoanalysis 5.) Sexual Morality 6.) Christian Marriage 7.) Forgiveness 8.) The Great Sin (pride) 9.) Charity 10.) Hope 11.) Faith 12.) FaithBook IV. BEYOND PERSONALITY: OR FIRST STEPS IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY 1.) Making and Begetting 2.) The Three-Personal God 3.) Time and Beyond Time 4.) Good Infection 5a.) The Obstinate Toy Soldiers 6.) Two Notes 7.) Let's Pretend 8.) Is Christianity Hard or Easy? 9.) Counting the Cost 10.) Nice People or New Men 11.) The New MenIn his preface, Lewis wrote, &quot;The reader should be warned that I offer no help to anyone who is hesitating between two Christian &quot;denominations.&quot; You will not learn from me whether you ought to become an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, or a Roman Catholic. . . Ever since I became a Christian I have thought that the best, perhaps! the only, service I could do for my unbelieving neighbours was to explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times.&quot; This was Lewis's purpose in creating this book, to discuss what Baxter called &quot;mere&quot; Christianity, or the bare essentials that should be common to all Christians. In a book that is less than 200 pages long, it is amazing that Lewis was able to accomplish such a task. Regardless of whether you are already a Christian, or someone who is interested only in what it is that Christians believe, this concise book explains the basics in an engaging fashion."
1656,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,,,1/4,5.0,854409600,The warm hands that thaw the skeptic's frozen heart,"What can be said that hasn't already be said about this amazing book. This is the book that brought me to the heart of Christ and showed me what it truly means to be Christian. After reading this book the Bible came alive with meaning and now never ceases to speak to my heart. I shall never be the same again, nor do I want to be. If you are to read this book please lay aside your presuppostions about Christianity and Jesus, open your mind and open your heart or open not the book at all. If today you hear His voice harden not your heart"
1657,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,,,32/58,3.0,939513600,Second-rate even among Lewis's oeuvre,"C. S. Lewis has been compared to such robust Christian and literary personalities as Chesterton and Samuel Johnson, and like them it's impossible to sum him up in a single sentence. Well -- Lewis was a fascinating man. I doubt he would have had his virtues if he had not had his contradictions. But all personal opinions about the man aside, this book is not Lewis at his best. Conceded, he had an extraordinary gift for metaphor, wrote with disarming clarity and lucidity, and, as far as I can tell, really strove to live a life of spiritual regeneration. These elements are present in this book, but cannot redeem its gross failing to make Christian orthodoxy appear logical. [You can interpret that remark however you like.] As Hardy (I believe it was) said of Cardinal Newman's _Apologia_, the argument is admirable and would compel assent if only one could accept the initial premises. I give it three stars because it is better than a lot of stuff that gets published, it's become sort of a classic and deserves a point for that, and, finally, it does have its &quot;moments&quot;; but I can't give it any more because of the frankly elementary lapses in reasoning, and because its reputation (IMHO) far exceeds its worth. Here's a tear-out guide to your likely reaction depending on your faith or lack of it:1) Theologically conservative Christian, esp. evangelical Protestant: You'll love this book, if you haven't already read it.2) Other Christian: You'll find much of value and might even be swayed toward Lewis's orthodoxy.3) Lapsed Christian and/or &quot;seeker&quot;: This could signal your reawakening, like the _Hortensius_ to St. Augustine -- depending on your previous reading and experience. But you're not likely to be *wholly* won over.3) Hardened atheist: You'll be confirmed in all your worst opinions about the intelligence of Christians.4) Agnostic: Your results will vary."
1658,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A2Y47HN5IP85J,M. Richardson,6/7,3.0,1267660800,Articulate and Eminently Readable Classic of Christian Apologetics,"CS Lewis' apologetic classic, Mere Christianity, while dated in many ways (the basic content was formulated in a series of BBC radio broadcasts in the early 40s), is probably the best short and sweet introduction to the ideas of Christianity that you could ask for. Lewis was a fantastic author of both fiction and non-fiction, and his writing here is joy to read: lucid, humble, direct, and unpretentious, all at once. He communicates complex religious ideas to the common person gracefully, and somehow manages to avoid sounding like he is ever talking down to them. This is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons why this simple work has influenced so many people: it is approachable, but it isn't watered-down, either.Another reason this work is so remarkable is because of how unconventional it was, for its time: rather than engaging in the kind of circular argumentation that Christians are commonly (and rightly) mocked for, Lewis attempts to build a philosophical case for the truth of Christianity from the ground up. With nary a bible verse citation or argument from design/revelation in sight, he begins, first, with the basic universal moral code found, in one variation or another, in all societies around the world, throughout history, and from there works his way up to the existence of a God. Not the Christian God, mind you, but merely a purely theistic conception of God. From there, he analyzes further types of religious ideas, rejecting what he views as false ideas as he goes along, until he comes to the basic concept of the God of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, and from there begins to explore genuinely Christian religious concepts. The idea here was that one could arrive at a belief in the truth of Christianity through the process of reasoning alone. Needless to say, this remains hugely influential.Well, so far, it sounds like I really like this book. So why only three stars? It is because Lewis' reasoning is often fallacious. Other reviews have gotten into specifics (the fallaciousness of the argument from universal morality, the fallaciousness of the liar/lunatic/lord argument, etc.), so I'll spare the recap. Needless to say, however, because of the weaknesses in this work's central arguments, I remain an unconvinced atheist. Nevertheless, this book is profoundly well-written, historically significant, and some of its ideas have made for interesting discussions with Christian friends. So I'm rating this three stars. This isn't anywhere near the best Christian apologetic available on the market, but you can't beat it as an introduction to the field of Christian apologetics. If you're Christian, you've probably already read this and most likely adore it. If you're a non-Christian, it might give you some interesting ideas to chew on for awhile, even if it isn't enough to sway your belief at all."

So there are other works by Lewis that classify as Lewis classics, or even as classics, period. An example would be ""Till We Have Faces."" But this is quibbling. To include all of the classic Lewis works in one volume would require, not a coffee table book, but a book the size of a coffee table. This is a great collection, nicely bound, on good paper with clear type and a readable font size, at an unbeatable price.

This book is an absolute must-read that has stood the test of time very well and is still thoroughly relevant today. There are a few books I think every Christian should read; this one is near the top.Whether you're a new Christian trying to learn more about your faith, or you've been a Christian for awhile and want to learn how to defend your faith, or aren't a Christian at all and would like to know why Christians believe what they do, then this is the book for you. I wouldn't even think about going into apologetics without having read it, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to non-Christians and ""seekers"" who want to learn more about Christianity. This is also a great book for Christians of any maturity level; in fact, it's one you'll probably want to read multiple times.In our postmodernist, relativistic age where people are becoming increasingly skeptical of Christianity, it is becoming more important than ever to be able to articulate and defend the truth clearly, and this book will help you do that as a Christian. Christianity is facing challenges on every side, from the rise of Islam to the popularity of the ""New Atheists"" to the dominance of secular humanism in the public school system, and Christians MUST be able to respond to these challenges; if we can't, then I fear for the future of Christianity in this culture.Not that the benefits of this book are exclusively for Christians. Even if you're a non-Christian, I think you will find this book informative and thought-provoking; it will show you that being a Christian does not require you to exercise blind faith, check reason at the door, or ignore the facts. I once heard someone define faith as believing something you know isn't true; C. S. Lewis shows that, at least in terms of Christianity, nothing could be further from the truth. Who knows - you may even be persuaded by this book, as many other people have, and become a Christian yourself. But even if you don't, I think you will still find this book challenging.I honestly can't recommend this book enough. I can't think of anyone who I wouldn't recommend this book to, and I would recommend it without reservation or qualification. If you've never read this book, I suggest you do so as soon as you can."

If Christ genuinely is the Word, then his message should make perfect sense even apart from the written word.One of the things Lewis demonstrated very well was the fact that if you look at man's dilemma as being fallen, and consider how he came to be in this dilemma, then the solution that Christianity offers makes perfect sense.The concept of the trinity is also covered very well.Finally, the chapter on God and Time sheds light on a few misconceptions about God's nature, and introduces a number of different ways of thinking about time that make it easier to see how God can hear everyone's prayers, or how the fact that God knows my future doesn't mean that I have no choice over the matter."

The gaps in logic are often dumbfounding.My favorite example is Lewis's argument that you cannot accept Jesus as a wise man unless you accept that he is God, because anyone who claims to be God, and isn't God, is barking mad. Putting aside the issue of whether ""the hisorical Jesus"" actually made such a claim, alas, anyone who has ever taken a even a cursory look at the great writers and sages throughout history knows that one minute they can be the fount of wisdom and the next can be absolutely off their rocker. Dostoevsky springs most immediately to mind.And thats not the worst gap in logic in the book.So, those looking for a reasoned defense of Christianity are strongly advised to go straight to G.K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man and skip this one."

At first, it made sense. As did the typical comparison Lewis made immediately afterward about if there was no light, ""dark"" would be meaningless.But then, I actually thought about it, and realized: if there was a or many gods, then the thought of a world without god/s would be meaningless, yet, it has meaning.In the same light, a world devoid of meaning could still contain the illusion of meaning, just as a world without divinity could still contain the illusion of one.So when one finds out that meaningfullnes is just an illusion, meaningless still retains a defintion since the experience of meaningfullness, even though it was never real, has been... experienced.To reiterate Lewis' argument, if the world was truely meaningless, then no one would realize the fact since meaning has never reached us. And that is true until you have taken the imaginative faculties of humanity. Meaning is purely perceptual, opinionated, biased. Sky diving can be extremely meaningful, but not to someone who hates it or does not care for the experience of falling. So taking the human mind out of the universe, it is entirely devoid of meaning.There are many other examples in the book I'm sure, I just flipped to a random page here and found an interesting sophism logic at work and thought I'd share it."

There is no current Christian writer who can hold a candle to him, and he writes for believers and non-believers alike. When I have moments of depression or doubt, simply turning to this book lifts my spirit and sets me back on the true course. What a treasure C.S. Lewis was to all Christians, and what a treasure he continues to be.This book contains all his major long works of nonfiction. It is an outstanding compilation, well laid-out, easy to read. Again, my only fault is with the poor quality of the binding. For $25.00, a book should be bound well, not glued irregularly.Still, a treasure. Get the hardback."

If you are searching for the meaning of your life, if you think there's gotta be more than what we see and perceive in our earthly existence, if your heart tells you to honestly seek for the truth, look no further; no other book will help you discover it. Actually God is reachable to everyone. You only have to be willing to put aside those obstacles in your vision. C. S. Lewis is not out there to ""get you"", nor preach to you. He'll help you figure it out yourself better than any other philosopher or scientist.Some people will start looking for God by means of their intellectual curiosity, others will do it out of despair and sheer anguish, and others simply draw near Him out of love for His Son Jesus Christ. Whatever means to start your search is good as long as it is honest. (But remember that faith is a gift that God gives you, not that you give to yourself).The book deals in its first short chapters with Natural Law, and it explains the difference with the laws of nature, e.g. gravity, etc. The language is simple enough for anybody to understand (if I understand it anybody can). Natural Law is still one of the unrefutable evidences for the existence of God that nobody can deny, or explain. Human Genome Project founder Francis Collins explains this very clearly too in his book 'The Language of God'. By the way, Collins says that the other choice we, humans, have in order to understand our nature is accepting that life is the result of an infinite series of miraculous ""coincidences"" or chances, whose probability are, each one of them, infinitely small.I am reading this book for the second time, now in Spanish (Amazon doesn't let me publish my review to the Spanish edition). I am underlining almost every line. There is so much to think about here. But I'd like to quote the following lines:""In religion, as in war and in everything else, consolation is the only thing that cannot be obtained by searching for it. If you look for the truth, you may find consolation in the end. If you look for consolation you will not find neither consolation nor the truth... only empty talk and preestablished conceptions to start with, and in the end, despair.""And this reminds me so much of one of Peter Kreeft's funny stories: When you were a child and believed in Santa, it made you feel comfortable and happy. Then why, when you grew up, did you stop believing in him? Why care for the truth if you can be happy?Approach it honestly; and God bless us all who so seek Him, for we shall surely find Him."
1676,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1XTWXIMUCDGQE,John,2/7,5.0,1040428800,Leading Up to the Leap,"C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity is a wonderful book. Lewis was at one time an atheist who later came to Christianity, and Mere Christianity is a compilation of Lewis's thought that lead to the conversion. The book is not a difficult read; Lewis has taken complex ideas and broken them down to their most simple forms. His thought is always logical, and almost as far as one can go, he details the logical reasons for God. Of course, as Kierkegaard and Lewis both know, faith in God can't be found by simple reasoning; there is that &quot;leap&quot; involved. For this reason, Lewis goes on to explain many of his basic beliefs about Christianity.Really, Mere Christianity is a great book to detail the most basic foundations of Christianity. There are a few areas where my own interpretations and opinions differ slightly from Lewis, but that is definitely to be expected. Lewis was open-minded and acknowledged that differences in doctrinal thought are essential from Christian to Christian. I think that this is part of the real strength of the book; C.S. Lewis has explained the most basic principals of Christianity in general, and the individual Christian can build on them. Mere Christianity can be an essential tool to help the Christian better articulate his/her beliefs, and the book can also serve as a very basic introduction to a person considering or wanting to learn about Christianity."
1677,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1PQ76H0AFQ0CR,Jason A. Greer,0/0,5.0,1201478400,an apologetic vs. modernism,"Originally a series of radio broadcasts, Mere Christianity is the capstone of C S Lewis's work to address the skepticism of the modern age and an encouragement to individual believers battling an environment that is hostile to Christian thinking. By its very title, the book attempts to describe the cornerstones of the Christian faith against the backdrop of a skeptical age that has lost much of its understanding of the core of the Christian faith. Speaking passionately as a layman, with all the imprecision entailed therein, that that entails, Lewis attempts to precisely describe the basics of the core of Christianity, while being deliberately vague about the disagreeable matters that have divided various Christian groups and have led to misunderstandings about the core teachings of the faith.The addresses that make up Mere Christianity were delivered in an environment that could best be described as a deep crisis in Great Britain in particular and in the West in general. In the midst of the conflagration of World War II, rampant theological liberalism, philosophical naturalism and humanism and the pressures of the post - Industrial Revolution, Lewis's arguments in Mere Christianity achieved a long-lasting audience because they simply articulated answers of eternal issues within the context of a discordant world.Mere Christianity is organized deductively. Lewis begins by leading towards theism by starting with the argument of natural law. But he approaches this knowledge with the assumption that we see through a glass darkly. That we first know God, not usually by a direct encounter with Him, but by seeing how God works within the lives of individuals, and not necessarily by any sort of miraculous work.Mere Christianity, for the secular world, soundly refutes the thinking that says that men just need to behave, be well adjusted and live sanely. For Lewis, the problem is not that men are mal adjusted and unhappy, but that they are not moral. The actions that men try to change the most, external actions such as appearance and social etiquette, do not change what needs to be changed - the immoral actions that offend a moral God. Here the thought is put forth that it is much better to be a just man than to perform just actions. The speed of modern secular society demands nothing more than that we perform just, and polite, actions towards each another.For the Christian in the church who is attacked from within and without, Lewis presents a two-fold approach. First, one must know that the faith is much easier than expected from the world. Secondly, that within a church that at times decays from within, the faith is much harder than is expected. For the modern, secular world there are no answers, only platitudes. As Lewis said, ""What point is there in learning to steer a boat if all boats are old leaking tubs""? Christ invaded the world to make men adopted sons, and believers in Him are slowly being turned into grand ships that work as they were originally designed. For the church, Lewis offers hard encouragement. Temperance, for example, is more than avoidance of alcohol. It is the avoidance of all things that can be good, but are turned into idolatrous behavior. The ultimate encouragement of Mere Christianity is that men would not only know the core of the faith, but that they would be encouraged to have their very core changed by the dynamic One who invaded the earth."

His arguments are very easy and quick to follow, and laced with analogies that only strengthen his points. He is able take the reader on a road that very rationally reveals the truths of Christianity by starting out with a skeptic's view then using logic to go beyond that view. He then builds on this with clear facts and observations in a smooth manner that is intellectual and well-structured.Unlike similar works, he focuses his attention on the evidence of Christianity and uses that to lead up to the practice of the faith. He smoothly gets from point a to b, rather than diving right in and using a fire and brimstone approach.

1687,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,ACKAP8O7E1QN3,Paul Doland,24/38,2.0,1029542400,"Good writing, but fails to make his case","I feel out of my league critiquing Mr. Lewis. I certainly recognize he is a gifted writer. All I am trying to do is say why, at least for me, he didn't prove his case.The book is divided into four books, and at this time I'm only intending on commenting on the first two. The reason being that the latter two books are for Christians. The first two are for those that are contemplating Christianity.Lewis starts out his argument for the existence of God by first attempting to prove the existence of what he calls ""The Moral Law"". It seems that a reader's perception of the strength of Lewis' argument for the existence of God completely stands or falls based on whether said reader is convinced by the argument of the existence of this purported Law. Lewis argues that it seems that everybody has some innate understanding of a proper, moral behavior. He says that if we didn't, it would make no sense to say that Nazi's behaved ""badly"". Saying they behaved ""badly"" only makes sense if you have a fundamental understanding of what it would mean to behave well.My first complaint is that I feel he trivializes the differences of morality amongst different cultures. He agrees that there are differences but says ""these have never amounted to anything of a total difference... Men have differed as to whether you should have one wife or four. But they have always agreed that you should not simply have any woman you liked."" Considering how much to do Christians (including Lewis himself) usually make of the properness of the biblical ""one man, one woman"" concept, it seems odd to have him say that isn't a real difference. Lewis neglects to mention that some cultures have found it acceptable for men to kill their wives if they find them displeasing. This isn't a real difference?However, I do agree that at least most cultures have had some form of ""The Golden Rule"". In fact, Lewis himself later refers to ""The Golden Rule of the New Testament (do as you would be done by)"". So, if I accept that at least most cultures have had some form of this, the question then becomes, where did it come from? Lewis discusses two naturalistic possibilities, instinct and learned behavior. Lewis dismisses these. To dismiss instinct, Lewis discusses the scenario where somebody sees someone in trouble. They may have the instinct to run away to protect themselves. And he says they may have the instinct to help the other person. Yet somehow the person must make a choice between the two instincts, and the means that one employs to make that choice must be The Moral Law. It seems to me that it is more likely to be learned behavior even though Lewis dismisses that possibility.I shouldn't say that Lewis completely dismisses that The Moral Law as being learned behavior. In fact, he agree that it is, much like the multiplication tables are something that you learn. But we couldn't have arbitrarily made up the multiplication tables. Nor, he argues, could we have arbitrarily decided The Moral Law. For evidence of this, he again reiterates his claim that all cultures have had similar morality; and if morality were arbitrary then that wouldn't be so. As I've said, I'm not convinced this is the case. But I have agreed that most cultures have had some form of The Golden Rule. So Lewis would say that I'm agreeing with him. Well, not really. Is there any other possible explanation for the universitality of The Golden Rule? I think there is. For my own self preservation, it seems obvious that I would want other people to not to decide to arbitrarily kill me. It also seems obvious that I would have no reason to have such expectation of other people, if I won't likewise arbitrarily go kill them. It doesn't seem to me that it requires a God to have told me this. Granted, in today's society, the concept of treating others as you would have them treat you sometimes seems to be in amazingly short supply. Yet I'd still say that it really shouldn't take a rocket scientist, let alone God, to figure this out.Lewis accepts some desire to help others is instinct. He calls it the ""herd instinct"". I'd prefer to call it ""empathy"". Many Christians ask why would this evolve? If we evolved, wouldn't we evolve primarily the instinct to save ourselves? However, Lewis doesn't ask this question and accepts that we do in fact have such an instinct. But he believes that the self-preservation is a stronger instinct and that therefore if someone chooses to help someone instead of saving themselves, it must be because of The Moral Law. However, he doesn't seem to offer any proof that the self-preservation instinct would be stronger than empathy. But even if he is correct and self-preservation is the stronger instinct, the combination of learned behavior plus the ""herd instinct"" seems to me to be quite capable of being stronger than the self-preservation instinct, at least in some individuals in some situations. Maybe I can't prove that my explanation is correct. But I assert that Lewis has not proven it to be wrong."
1688,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,AT6Z6G71SNMYM,Tron Honto,4/11,4.0,990316800,"A Decent, well-paced introduction to the Christian faith","Some statements: @ the time of writing this short review there are nearly 80 reviews, and rarely do I usually think that I have something to add when so many have already given their opinion. Still, I think I have some important statements for readers out there who have not yet encountered this book.The title, Mere Christiantiy, is really key. While many conservative evangelicals, who often lack a real encounter with the deeper Christian theological tradition present in works by such men as Niebuhr, Tillich &amp; Barth, may present this book to you as THE definitive argument for Christianity, he/she would be in error. Indeed, this is not the author's intent whatsoever. Rather, this book is to serve as a mere cursory introduction to what he sees as Christian orthodoxy, or gestalt if you will ---being the elements present and preserved throughout the faith's history. In some way, he fails @ this task showing that he himself was not immmune to the prejudices of his time (e.g., passages that present the man as 'head of the household').Also, Lewis was neither too liberal nor too conservative, though he was certainly traditional. He certainly was NOT fundamentalist or evangelical (e.g., he did not adhere to the plenary, verbal inspiration of Scripture). Thus, to read him as being an adherent to this flavor of Christianity is to MISread him.Of course, this book has its apologetic elements, and of course, it is not exhaustive. Lewis is not trying to subjugate all of our doubts to the mastery of his arguments. He rarely was so arrogant. One must read this with his attention in mind--- to explain mere Christianity will simultaneously showing it to be reasonable. And, he attempts to soften some of what to outsiders may seem as rough edges and succeeds quite often with amazing fecundity.Despite the impression some may get from the strong recommendations given for this book (and it is indeed a classic), it is best not to assume that this will be the end all to searching. Mere Christianity serves best to introduce an ignorant person of the beliefs of Christianity when knowledge is lacking and to aid the believer in understanding his own faith. For those who would want to encounter more developed, firm arguments and/or have travelled further down the path of intellectual development, this book can't harm, but there is much more to be sought out. For a strong apologetic work, which is more contemporary yet still becoming dated itself, I recommend Hans K&uuml;ng's ON BEING A CHRISTIAN. This work is rather large, so for a smaller volume, try Keith Ward's GOD, FAITH &amp; THE NEW MILLENIUM."

He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for &quot;yes.&quot; The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing.

Lewis is writing as if Christianity were the ttruth"" hilarious. The book ""Mere Christianity"" is written to explain what Christians believe, and, just like the Muslims and the Jews and the Hindus, we believe that our religion is true. Therefore I cannot fathom why someone would be surprised that the sentence ""Christianity is true"" would be in there. In fact, if I were reading a book about the beliefs of Islam from a devout Muslim and did NOT perceive that he believed ""Islam is true"" I would be a little worried about why that would not be stressed in the religion. Did that make any sense? I tend to babble.And many people have had complaints about the first part of his book, where he argues why there must be a deity, etc. As I discovered later, he is not giving an absolute, but simply letting the reader follow the path that he took in transitioning from an athiest to a Christian. First of all, let me just say it was incredibly more logical than anything I went through, but of course it is not pure logic. In any sort of decision anyone comes to (c'mon, I think even Spock admits to this on Star Trek), there is never nothing but pure logic. There is a bit of pure instinct involved, something beyond logic, which cannot be accounted for in words. So when there seem to be random jumps in his explanations or holes in his logic, I think that is the reason.Oookay. Anyway. I came into this book having my only other C.S. Lewis experience be ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and naivly assumed that was simply how he wrote. So let me just say first off that I was knocked on the floor by the complexity and the thoughtfulness that went into his writing.There are, of course, flaws, like there are in any book; fiction, non-fiction, religious, secular, etc. As a rather modern teenage girl with a rather modern outlook on life and an innate hatred for the ""glass ceiling"" let me say that when I read his comments on the woman's place I had a distinct urge to go back in time, hurl feminist pamphlets at him, and burst into the song ""You Don't Own Me"" in the manner of the 3 women of ""The First Wives Club.""But in some other instances I found him remarkably insightful. My favorite parts of the book were the ones where I would basically see him saying the exact opposite as those TV evangelists and ultra-conservative fundamentalist Christians I (and, I belive most people) have begun to get seriously sick of. In places where I was extremely afraid he would fall into the old super conservative, narrow minded view like so many of his contemporaries, I found him incredibly refreshing and even a bit liberal and open minded in his opinions.For the athiest, agnostic, and people of other religions considering this book: While it isn't an evangelical book bent on getting you hooked on Christianity if it's the last thing he does, it IS written from a Christian pov and explains the basics of what Christians believe under the assumption that Christianity is true. Please do not be thrown off balance by this. If you were writing something about what you believed, I would hope you would consider it to be true first."

He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible.

And I recommend it to all Christians, young or old, mature or not. I even recommend it to non-Christians. C. S. Lewis was an atheist before he came to Christ, so he understands and has worked through many common intellectual barriers to Christianity.But more important than that, C. S. Lewis has an uncanny knack of being able to simplify some of the more difficult to grasp theological concepts of Christianity, breaking them down into more simple ideas which are more easily understood.My only caution is that one must understand that this was originally a radio broadcast, which Lewis then wrote out and published. In some sections he takes a little more time to explain/explore things which he couldn't quite go into so much detail about on the radio. This makes for, I think, a more conversational tone of writing, which is very easily read. But also, this was originally published in the early 1940s in England, which means that there are certain cultural (English) and sociological (note the World War II influences) references and metaphors/analogies which can take a post-2000 mind a couple of extra seconds to translate.That said, the issues C. S. Lewis tackles are timeless and his explanations still relevant. If you haven't read this, grab a copy and dive in - I think it's a book everyone should go through at least once in their life."

He tells you his assumptions, his biases and the steps in his logic. It is up to you whether you find his arguments convincing. In this book, he tries to show logically not only that a god exists, but that it is the Christian God in particular which exists. As we would expect, some arguments are better than others.Of course, people who already believe in the Christian God are much more likely to be convinced, but his arguments on the existence of God--particularly in sections concerning morality--are often quite strong. As the divinity of Christ is a much harder fact for some people to swallow, his proofs there also tend to be less convincing. Overall though--and I am a beliver--I found this about as good a &quot;proof&quot; of Christianity as there is.The book has aged well, and apart from what looks now like a quaint view of women and marriage, one could hardly imagine it was written in the first half of the 20th century."

Mere Christianity gave me a feeling of a fast paced thriller. Was it because I read it (just two chapters) when my head was swinging? No doubt he is a master apologist, but how masterful! If you are not watchful, he can trick you to a dreadful thing. It is all fine if god wished to create a world full of freewill beings rather than automatas. He tells me that god created the world full of creatures and let it go wrong because he saw it was worth the risk, because in the end he will have a world of creatures that loves him out of its own choice, save the rebels that he had to destroy that he himself made. God is omniscient and could see through the future the burning furnace and the joyful creatures at two ends choosing to create the world, despite the burning furnace, for the joyful creatures at the cost of burning souls. If there is god, Mr. Lewis and his disciples, if he has given me freewill to think, he is doomed by his own weapon. It is like a nightmarish fairy tale in which fathers reproduce children to sacrifice when came to puberty. They do not sacrifice all the children, only those chosen many, and to voice against their bestiality is blasphemy-after all they do not slaughter themselves given a big share to Luciferens.Lets not believe in a superstitiously maniac religion just because it can give us peace and pride. Let there be logic even in the worst crime.I am 26 turning 27 morrow. I am reading the rest of the book if only some one answered as to why god had to create the world, being omniscient, when he could see through time the burning furnace."

1709,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,AT7CXVV43ZSRX,"Reading Fan ""Romans 8:1""",4/8,5.0,1133222400,Christianity 101,"How would you explain Christianity in broad strokes to someone who doesn't know anything about it or maybe just a little about it? How do you explain Christianity to people of other world views, such as dualists or pantheists or atheists? What would our common experiences tell us about the Creator, if there is a Creator? How do you know there is a Creator? What is the Creator like, and how personal is He, if He indeed exists?Mere Christianity provides some classic answers written by one of the great Christian philosophers of the 20th century, C S Lewis, who sold almost 100 million books on Christian philosophy, some even in fantasy form (like the Chronicles of Narnia). It is not about Catholicism or Protestantism of any particular stripe, but is about `mere' Christianity, that is, Christianity in its basic essence. It is not about proving Christian doctrine from Scripture, but from logic instead. In other words, it is about high-level apologetics (philosophy) as opposed to the low-level apologetics (Scriptures) we are much more familiar with and many of us hear every Sunday from the pulpit. It is about talking to non-church goers about our beliefs, in language and logic familiar to everybody. It's about taking a step back and seeing what we have in Christianity.Lewis does an excellent job of breaking his arguments into digestible bite-size pieces that were originally his radio broadcasts of the 1940's. The language and sentence and paragraph structures are simple and accessible. He does a good job of making plain what he is saying, and though written simply, his arguments are thought-provoking and challenging.The early chapters tackle other world views with very logical arguments for a meaningful universe. If it could be logically deduced that God created the universe, then it would be logical that the universe has meaning. On the other hand, if the evidence shows that the universe just happened, then the universe has no meaning. Lewis proceeds by giving arguments for the existence of God based on our innate knowledge of good and evil, and where that knowledge must have come from. I found this to be the most challenging part of the book.The middle chapters go over Christian moral qualities and what they really mean and why having Christian qualities does not necessarily mean you're a Christian, and not having these qualities in full does not mean that you're not a Christian (which every Christian can be thankful for, by the way).The later chapters deal with such things as understanding the Trinity, being born-again, God being outside of time, and the God-man makeup of Christ. These are highly spiritual subjects that, of course, can only be approached and not fully explained. Remember, he is not proving anything by use of the Scripture, but is only using reason against the basic ideas of Christianity. He gives it a very good shot making liberal use of clever analogies to give us some sense of what these abstract ideas mean.It is a good book about what 'mere'Christianity is, and well worth the time and effort to understand, both for Christians and non-Christians."

1713,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A3CFBDIKSJNYFE,"Dan Panetti ""Worldview Director""",2/2,4.0,1182816000,Foundational work for apologetics - the defense of the faith,"Where to begin with one of the great classics of the Christian faith? Well, from the beginning, it must be noted that Mere Christianity truly is a must-read for all Christians and that is exactly the intent of the author himself. Lewis set out to write or at least describe the fundamentals of the faith - actually to the truth - to which he himself had been called to almost against his own preferences. Christianity, to Lewis, isn't a mental asset to some sort of religious dogma or doctrine, rather it truly is a confrontation with the greatest truth known to man - that the person of Jesus Christ truly is the Son of the Living God, and only by the redeeming work of Christ can man be restored to a right relationship with our Creator. Mere Christianity is an attempt, and a very good one at that, to describe the concept of how God has woven this inextricable truth into the hearts and minds of mankind. Lewis argues this concept by stating two universal truths that he defends throughout the book:1. That human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot get rid of it.2. That they do not in fact behave in that they.Lewis is describing the concept of natural law, or the ""Law of Nature"" which puts forth the concept that God created man with eternity set in their hearts and that man's own sinfulness acts as a veil shrouding this truth, but now fully, so that man knows right from wrong, but is enslaved by sin nature to a life of unrighteousness. The chapters of Mere Christianity are arranged in various arguments that address this universal truth, and the final conclusion, once Lewis has demonstrated his premise, is that if true, this argument demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that man is indeed created by an Intelligent Designer who has revealed Himself to mankind through general and specific revelations.Lewis' concept of Christianity is really very simple - the problem really is that man complicates things, either by mistake or on purpose. But Lewis' concept of Christianity can be summarized by the Creation-Fall-Redemption model. Christianity is a simple, straight-forward explanation for the world not only as we know it and experience it, but also as it was intended to be and what when wrong with it. God's creation is perfect; man's corruption of that original nature is the problem with the world - and now, we live in what Lewis calls ""enemy-occupied territory"" where the ""rightful king has landed"" and is working through the church (individual Christians) to take back what is rightfully His. Amazingly, as you read through Mere Christianity, you can see so much of the creative imagery that Lewis brings to life in his wonderful Chronicles of Narnia series.Lewis also argues that to live the Christian life one must follow the example set by Christ - they must die. Living the Christian life is not a matter of daily ritual or routine, but rather daily sacrifice and surrender. To truly live out the ideals of Christianity one must surrender themselves to the greater authority of the Christian walk - Christ Himself. If we are created for His purposes and for His glory, then we must realize that our understanding of His ways are lower and pale in comparison - the Christian life is not about raising our standards of living, but rather about us dying to self and being made alive in Him. Of course, Lewis then writes about seven ""virtues"" by which one can measure their Christian life, not in an attempt to live more righteously on our own accord, but rather for the world to measure our surrender to our God - literally for others to see the nature of God transcribed on our lives as we live out who He is before a watching and listening world.Lewis' concept of Christianity is a very positive approach - it is not a set of rules and standards that a person compares themselves to - rather the Christian life is an appreciation for the ideal, and a pursuit of that ideal through the grace and work of Christ in and through the life of each and every believer. To Lewis the greatest sin is pride - a concept that man, by his own regard and on his own strength, could live a life worthy of God's calling. ""Pride,"" writes Lewis, ""is spiritual cancer; it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense.""Christianity, while ""easy"" to explain for Lewis is not easy to live. Christianity takes work, hard work, and Lewis sets before each reader a pretty stout challenge at the end of Mere Christianity to truly live out this transformed life worthy of our calling as a follower of Christ. He contends that there is nothing ordinary about the Christian life - and, just as men have been great tyrants or great saints, to Lewis the concept of Christianity should force men into thoughts of greatness - not for themselves, but to represent the greatness of the One Whom they serve and represent.A great read for every Christian, Mere Christianity is simply a classic to be read and reread time and time again."

But Lewis isn't like the hundreds of Christian apologists that author thousands of books on the market. Lewis doesn't rely on circular reasoning or emotion to prove his points. Instead, 'Mere Christianity' sets forth an argument that is logical, easy enough to understand, and in accordance with the beliefs that the vast majority of Christians share.I don't think I could describe the content of this book anymore for fear of reducing it to one argument or a handful of points. This is a broad, sweeping book that takes the reader from theism vs. atheism to the problem of duality to sexual immorality. It's at times philosophical, at times theological, and at times even political. Nevertheless, 'Mere Christianity' is not a difficult read.'Mere Christianity' is an important book for all Christians and an essential book for non-Christians. This book has converted many to Christianity, including Francis Collins, author of 'The Language of God' and a prominent scientific voice on the Christian front.

This book is laid out in three parts: Right and Wrong, What Christians Believe, and Christian Behaviour. In the third part--Christian Behaviour--Mr. Lewis eloquently portrays what it means to accept Christ.Mr. Lewis understood very well the true principle: one of the things that will make heaven indeed heaven is the way people treat each other and deal with each other. Those who accept Christ will find themselves yearning to live as he lived, and do as he did. By doing so, they will ultimately build the kind of character it takes to be ""heavenly.""Mr. Lewis also points out some of the characteristics that prevent us from developing such character -- such as pride. ""Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man."" Mr. Lewis points out that pride is one of the many qualities, which (if unbridled) keeps so many people away from true discipleship in Christ. The competitive nature of pride compels us to squander away our limited time on earth in a competitive pursuit of worldly treasures and success, which (for most of us) is at the expense of more important things. And, if my life has been spent without performing the Christ like acts of service and love -- necessary to build ""heavenly character,"" can I actually expect heaven to be a place where I will comfortably fit in?I highly recommend this book and I find it a valuable addition to my library."

Lewis examines faith and Christianity without biasing any particular denomination. This book is divided into four sections. In the first two sections, Lewis writes as an apologetic. He takes a philisophical approach to describe that humans have a moral standard and this standard originates from God. Lewis also defends Jesus Christ's claim to be God and how we are redeemed through His death on the cross. I found this section to be very well written and intriguing.In the third section, Lewis examines Christian behavior. He discusses various topics including the four Cardinal virtues, the three theological virtues, sexual morality and the Christian marriage, and my favorite chapter - ""The Great Sin"" (pride). I would be surprised to find a reader that would be disappointed in this section. It is very intriguing and is an excellent reference looking at sin and appropriate behaviors for Christians.The last section discusses the trinity and Lewis's view of the life as a Christian. This is probably the most challenging section of the book. Lewis even warns readers that they may want to skip a chapter or two if they don't think it will help them.

1736,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A1OAN01CO11VIX,Chris Redford,18/34,2.0,1193097600,A Careful Review of Lewis's Assumptions,"I know many people adore this book and are very hostile to low-star reviews so I want to be very careful to explain my viewpoint in a way that is fair and reasonable.SECULAR HUMANISTI am a Secular Humanist. That means I believe in truth, testing beliefs, evidence, ethics, growth, enriching human life, and enriching the world for future generations. I tell you this to assure you that I believe in many positive things and generally have a lot of hope for humanity and a lot of appreciation for positive instruction. For this reason, I appreciate a lot of the positive instruction that Lewis gives in Books III and IV. I am glad he has a positive attitude and these two sections of the book may very well do some good.However, I also believe in the testing of beliefs. I do not accept anything without question and any of my beliefs is always open to question. That does not mean I believe in nothing strongly. I very much do. But you can always change my mind with a reasonable argument or evidence. I'll never cling to any belief with complete unmoving certainty. As limited human beings I am convinced that we could never have any such invincible beliefs.With this foundation, I read the first two sections (Books I and II) of Lewis's book. Here is what I found:INNATE MORALITYIn Chapter 1, Lewis makes the praiseworthy analysis that all human beings have an innate morals. He shows this with undeniable examples. Essentially he shows that we all wish to be moral. Whenever someone calls us immoral, we instantly try to set our reputations right again. We may do this by apologizing and admitting wrongness or we may do it by defending ourselves and showing rightness. But either way, we are concerned with being in the right again. Either way, we are all concerned with morals.However, at the end of this otherwise laudible chapter, Lewis makes a sudden, weighty, unjustified assumption: we largely do not meet the demands of our innate morals. We are inherently immoral. Examples he uses are ""you were unfair to your children when you were tired"" or ""you broke a promise because you were busy"".The first assumption that Lewis makes here is that these occurences are common. I really feel they are not. I think it is rare that one breaks a promise and that it is usually on accident.The second assumption that Lewis makes is that these occurences are altogether terrible and deserve the weighty sledgehammer of a label ""Immoral"". I disagree here also. These are just mistakes. Mistakes that are altogether largely not our fault. They are tied up in the limitations of the human body and mind as well as the sheer difficulty of dealing with the natural world.MORAL LAWBut suddenly we have bigger problems because Lewis is making even bigger assumptions. Not only is he saying that we have innate morals (as he so eloquently argues for in the first chapter). He is assuming that these innate morals arise from a crystal clear Moral Law that all humans know. So not only is he saying we have moral sense, he is saying that every human situation has an obvious moral choice that every participant in the situation should know. The reason we humans do not always choose the obviously right choice dictated by the Moral Law is because of our selfishness.Let me give you some examples which bring this assumption into question.A man holds a gun in each hand to the heads of two other men. He asks you which of them should be killed. He will spare the other. Which do you choose?A man is standing in front of an oncoming car. If you jump in and push him out of the way, you will be killed. Both of you have families of equal size. So whichever of you is killed, their family will suffer. Which do you choose?Here is a final one that is probably closer to reality. You find that your country is filled with people who *appear* to want to kill you at any time. For example, you are members of different hostile social groups. You don't know for sure whether they are going to kill you but they could at any moment. Do you respect their right to human life and risk the lives of your family by not attacking? Or do you act on an unverified suspicion and risk attacking potentially innocent people but protect your family?The ""obvious"" choice of the Moral Law is not so obvious in these examples. Because either choice will cost someone. All difficult moral choices are like this and they are much more common than people think, especially in our complex global society. They are difficult choices because we don't have enough information to clearly choose one side over the other.Typically when people make different moral choices they do so because they have different information. Not because one is following the ""Moral Law"" and the other is not. Both people would follow the same innate morality given the same information (this has been demonstrated in scientific studies). But due to the vast complexity of the world and the limitations of our perception, we simply do not always have the same information as other people when making our judgments.DETRIMENTAL TO MORAL PROGRESSPeople like Lewis, who try to oversimplify the inherently complex global situations facing our world do much more harm than good. The most moral person would actually first recognize that they do not have all the information to make the perfect moral choice and probably never will. This person would recognize that it is their moral duty to question their own first assumptions about the situation and gather evidence to hone their perspective.I think it is clear that belief in an immediately clear Moral Law is actually detrimental to moral progress. Because what it actually does is cause people to believe that their first assumptions are the correct ones and then fight for them uncompromisingly. We very rarely have enough information for our first assumptions to be correct, especially in complex global situations. These situations involve need-to-know history and psychology of the conflicting parties before one could even fathom making an accurate moral judgement.Even in our everyday lives, with conflicts between just two people, two separate human lives can be so complex that one could not possibly make a satisfactory moral judgement without carefully examining both sides of the story. But the way Lewis talks, he seems to think that everyone just instantly knows what is happening and what the correct moral choice is. Lewis seems completely ignorant of the necessity of dialogue and careful examination to resolve moral issues between peoples. He thinks everyone should just ""know"" the ""Moral Law"".THE ORIGIN OF INNATE MORALITYUnfortunately, we are hardly past the first chapter but I am running out of room for my address of Lewis's assumptions. I've not even gotten to the part on page 29 where Lewis makes the unjustified leaps from ""[there must be] Somebody or Something behind the Moral Law"" to ""[it is] Somebody"" to ""[it is] God"". I agree that there is somebody or something behind innate morality. But Lewis hardly did any evidence examination to determine that it was Somebody. He just assumed it with very little justification.His perfunctory ""herd instinct"" argument starting on page 9 is hardly adequate to refute the belief that morality emerged from evolution. He is going to have to do more work than that to convince anyone with an understanding of natural selection that morality isn't an obviously valuable selection trait for evolution. I think there is clearly more evidence that it is ""Something"" (natural selection) behind innate morality and not ""Somebody"". Evidence for this goes back as far as Darwin himself who convincingly argued for it. Just search ""Evolution of Morality"" on Google.CONCLUSIONSSo I think no one here would deny that the concept of a crystal clear Moral Law is at the heart of C.S. Lewis's philosophy. And I don't think any reasonable person would deny that I have cast serious doubt on the reality of that concept.Probably my biggest criticism of Lewis is that he styles is writing in a way to make it appear to be unbiased reasoning when he is actually making many biased assumptions about the superiority of Christianity. And what is worse: unlike an honest philosopher, Lewis never states these assumptions explicitely. He seems to just make them and hope you don't notice the philosophical slip. Or maybe I am being too hard on him and he is making these assumptions unknowingly.In any case, this book is misleading for Christians because it gives them the illusion that they have objectively considered alternatives to their faith when they actually haven't. Lewis presents straw man versions of the real alternatives to Christianity (there is no mention of Secular Humanism, for example; maybe he just didn't know about it).And finally, as a critically thinking person, it was very frustrating for me to read Lewis because of his relentless onslaught of untenable assumptions to support each successive idea. It was like watching someone try to build a skyscraper out of driftwood. And I hope that's not too harsh. But that was my honest experience."

Lewis' ""Mere Christianity"" doesn't really break new ground in original Christian thought as much as simplifies some observations of Christian strictures. It's not a guide to prescriptive living as much of an insight to what a rationally minded Christian intellectual thinks about his religion. I suppose I approached this book with minor expectations of life altering thought. That's not what I got out of it, but instead was reminded and reaffirmed of some beliefs that lay dormant but still deeply entrenched. Lewis's observations are simplistic but deep. For that fact, Lewis earns quite a bit of admiration for turning the complex into easily digestible reading is a daunting task.I found the book getting interesting about mid-way through. The first half was almost too simplistic. Lewis has some perceptive observations of society's obsession with sex (without being prudish), forgiveness being difficult to put into practice, and the ability of God to change a person but sometimes not in ways that person would expect or be comfortable with. Of particular note is Lewis' observation of when a person is brought closer to God. It is not when everything is going right in life and church visits are consistent, but rather when one is brought to question and search on their own, when life is challenging and belief is challenging. There is a lot of truth to Lewis' writing but some of it rings through clearer than others.Life altering book...not so much. A Good reminder of God...yes."

As such, I suppose I am the ideal audience for this book, since CS Lewis undertakes to explain the fundamental unifying beliefs of the various Christian denominations in simple language and analogy that should be clear to anyone. In this, he succeeds admirably, although his tone often comes off as condescending. In the end, however, I was not persuaded. I am put off by his views on homosexuals and the role of women as well as his acceptance of the Christian's permission (if not obligation) to kill in cases such as war or criminal punishment.I was also not convinced by his basic premise that God must exist because humans everywhere share a basic moral sense. It is easier for me to believe that we evolved certain behaviors because they allowed us to coexist relatively peacefully in communities; these behaviors had survival value for us because we are best able to thrive in communities. Being the intellectually complex beings that we are, we have developed sets of religious belief to explain these behaviors and tendencies to ourselves.These problems notwithstanding, ""Mere Christianity"" is a readable and illuminating introduction to Christian thought and merits reading."

1745,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A3B1VHNCY7OLXW,Edgar Lipsey,2/2,5.0,1179273600,"Nothing ""mere"" about this work","What an astounding, impressive, fulfilling read. I am not normally a non-fiction reader unless it is a good historical piece or biography ... those I will lap up. But a book on religion? As a pretty dedicated church goer myself, I must candidly say that unless the book is actual scripture itself, it might as well be one of those desperately snobbish self-help books full of zippy motivation quotes and the same principles you find in all other books of the same genre, just worded slightly differently. Yet in Mere Christianity, I found none of the superficiality I've previously experienced with other books that delve into philosophic explorations of religion. This is a real study, a deep probe. There is nothing artificial about it. Thank goodness my wife is a huge C.S. Lewis fan or I might not have picked it up at all. But she recommended it to me, and I had it on a trip, and for hours and hours I read, mesmerized in a way that few thrillers can even achieve. What did I find? I found that in this work C.S. Lewis single-handedly legitimizes religion as a belief, lifestyle, and philosophy. And what makes Lewis most credible is that Mere Christianity is not designed to make any reader comfortable, from agnostic to new age believer to hard core Christian. His ideas and reasoning are solid and unavoidable. His ability to address concerns is acute and thorough. He is not pompous, but he is confident. Where he is unsure of something, he admits it, though I'd be careful to deviate from such a sound philosopher. Probably his greatest talent is his use of applicable examples and parallel images. Where a concept is vague, he has the ability to nail it down, to apply it to the known. C.S. Lewis rings of truth throughout. And probably the most important thing in his book, or in any book for that matter, is that when I put it down, I was determined to be a better person, to fix up deficiencies in my life. Mere Christianity is not ""merely"" another book on religion or Sunday School manual; it is a call to arms for every person who picks it up, regardless of their faith. Go to it with an open mind, and be prepared to act afterwards."

1751,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A3M5NHNTD6476W,Eric Boyer,1/1,4.0,1231891200,Excellent Discussion of Christianity,"This is a great book for people who are either half or fully convinced about Christianity. But, and I should mention this right away, this book is not meant to convince a non-Christian that Christianity is true. Many other books have been written for this purpose, and if you want to find one then just search for a Christian apologetics book.This book answers many questions that Christians might ask about their faith, and does so in an easy-to-read format, almost like a novel. The book is written in a very non-technical manner, so almost anyone should be able to understand what Lewis is talking about. Also, there are lots of analogies to help the reader better understand what is being explained.This book is comprised of four smaller books called ""Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe"", ""What Christians Believe"", ""Christian Behaviour"", and ""Beyond Personality, or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity"".The first book explores the idea that the concepts of right and wrong are proof that a morally good God exists and loves us. Lewis does a good job of explaining this point, and, as usual, uses lots of analogies and examples. His explanation may not convince an atheist that God exists, but nevertheless it provides food for thought for all readers. Again, if you want to be shown proof of why God exists then you shouldn't be looking for it in this book. Read a book that is dedicated to Christian apologetics instead.The second book explores the Christian idea of who and what God is, and discusses some aspects of the Christian faith. Some ideas that are discussed are pantheism, dualism, and the nature of the devil.The third book continues exploring what Christians believe, but does so in a more detailed way. Some concepts that are discussed are morality, sex, marriage, forgiveness, charity, and faith. This is my favorite of the four books because it gives some good reasons for why Christians believe what they do, and it also gave me a better understanding of what the Christian faith is about.The fourth book is the most abstract of the four, which makes sense considering that it's about the Trinity. This book also talks about what God wants from us and how we can become true Christians. A lot of this book is comprised of Lewis' opinions (rather than commonly accepted facts), but nevertheless it is an excellent read because Lewis has some very interesting and convincing opinions. Lewis' analysis of how we become ""true"" Christians was particularly interesting.Overall I consider this to be a very good book. Lewis is a very intelligent man who has many convincing arguments. I also enjoyed it because Lewis seems to think in the same way as me; many of the ideas that he presented are similar to things I have thought of in the past. Nevertheless, there are a few things about the book that I didn't like. For one thing, it is written in a very old-fashioned way which many young people may not be used to (but, Lewis wrote these books in the 1940's, so that is to be expected). Also, it would have been nice if the first book (which is commonly called ""The Case for Christianity"") included other proofs of the Christian God, rather than just dwelling on the origin of morality. Many people are not convinced by this proof, so it would have been a good idea to present other proofs such as miracles, the historical accuracy of the Bible, the origin of the universe pointing towards the existence of a god, etc. The final problem that I have with this book is that some parts are not at all convincing. But, this only applies to about 5% of the book, and perhaps these arguments that I consider weak would be convincing for other people, so this is a pretty insignificant objection.One final note about this book (and religious books in general). When it comes to religion (or any other controversial topic), many people are extremely biased, emotionally-driven, or narrow-minded. Not all people are like this, but way too many are. If you plan to read this book, or any other book that is about a controversial subject, please do so in an objective, emotionally-neutral, open-minded manner. Doing so will help you figure out what you truly believe."

However, I was surprised that he considered Roman Catholicism a &quot;Denomination&quot; of the Christian faith. I consider it to be another religion which misinterprets a fundamental teaching of true Christianity: Faith in Christ will produce works. Salvation is not earned by being a &quot;good&quot; person and going to mass. Salvation is a gift and a Christian will produce good works BECAUSE of his faith and the Holy Spirit that dwells within. Salvation cannot be earned.That being said, the book did offer some good insights into the christian faith. One thing I thought was interesting is a section in the last chapter where he describes striving to become a more sanctified christian as &quot;Great fun.&quot; I never thought of it this way, but yes, it is great fun.

1767,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A36R2CCU9CU8FX,Kimberly A. Piccione,10/14,5.0,1048377600,Something for Everyone,"I would recommend Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis to anyone, regardless of their beliefs. I believe every reader will find some part of the book that will prove to be useful. For those readers thinking or wandering about Christianity, Lewis provides them with the motivation and tools needed to get them headed in the right direction. Atheists reading the book may find Lewis's ideas and experiences interesting since he too was once an aheist, and he knows the doubts, questions and oppositions they may have. For Christians, Lewis prepares those who are faced with the need to explain and defend their beliefs while witnessing to others, which in turn builds their confidence to do so. Lewis's views are non-denominational and he does not attempt to define those boundaries, nor does he try to solicit their beliefs.In many ways, Lewis aids his readers through the reading process. The book is divided into four smaller books containing short chapters. Once a section is read, the reader is then allowed time to reflect and absorb the information provided before moving on. At the end of each chapter, Lewis attempts to summarize his purpose for that chapter and its intended message. Each new chapter brings up questions that may arise from reading the previous one, and provides more of an explanation to address those issues.Lewis is very careful not to prematurely turn a reader away or scare them off by forcing Christianity upon them. Lewis heightens the reader's awareness, and then slowly works in logical reasoning, so as not to overwhelm them. Instead of padding the book with teachings that will further confuse the reader, Lewis uses examples the reader can relate to, and then connects those examples to the point he is trying to make. Clearly, not every reader will find every chapter or section in the book helpful. Lewis advises the reader to take what they can from each chapter, and then move on to the next. He never claims to be an expert, but instead states his only authority is that of experience, as a layman, a Christian, and a former atheist. He even asks in his book for &quot;instructed Christians&quot; to advise him when he goes wrong.The opinions stated in Mere Christianity were originally voiced to people at war during World War II. Considering what is going on in our world today, this book might come at an appropriate time to offer hope, for those fighting for our country, and for those of us at home. It was meant to give comfort then, and it will give comfort to those who need it now. Lewis explains that God created a perfect world, not the bad things in it, and God's will is for those things that have gone wrong to be made right again.What I appreciate most is the wide range of an audience Lewis seeks to reach. For those who feel they don't understand Christianity, Lewis advises that they cannot begin to know how it works until they accept it. For those who have the fear of failing in their search, Lewis points out that failures are expected, and what matters most is the honest intent and the will to overcome.Lewis helps the reader to depend on God and strengthens their desires to turn things over to him. He offers some insight of Theology, aiding those searching to understand their faith, which in turn will allow their faith to grow. Lewis discusses hope and heightens Christian believers' desire for heaven. Readers will come away thankful for the earthly pleasures, but also knowingthe best is yet to come."

1772,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A2BWPZZPH55KU1,John M. Balouziyeh,0/0,5.0,1260230400,"Clear, lucid, persuasive","The following review is based on the 2001 HarperSanFrancisco edition copublished by Zondervan, with a foreword by Kathleen Norris:In this volume, C.S. Lewis, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century, successfully lays out those basic tenets that nearly all Christians have held together at all times. He employs convincing arguments in plain language to point to a system of absolute truth and he then comes full circle by arguing that this system is fully realized in a Christian worldview.1. The Case for Absolute ValuesHe opens the book by arguing that people hold to common perceptions of right and wrong, as can be evidenced in everyday, mundane situations. The statements that are exchanged in arguments, such as ""That's my seat, I was there first"" or ""Come on, you promised,"" demonstrate this tendency (p. 3). People quarreling typically do not discard the standard against which their conduct is being measured; rather, they try to justify themselves according to the standard. This, says Lewis, points to a system of absolute values that people hold in common.2. The Case for ChristLewis then challenges the reader to concede that he (the reader) has at sometime or another violated the very standards of behavior that ""we expect from other people"" (p. 7). Thus, although people believe in transcendent standards, they have throughout history and throughout cultures typically not acted in accordance with these standards. This is the gateway through which Lewis sets up the argument that he will employ throughout the rest of the book: people need to be justified, and Christianity offers the answers in Christ.The reader is challenged to examine the claims of Christ and to determine for himself whether or not Christ was God, as he claimed to be. If he was not, then he ""would either be a lunatic--on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg--or else he would be the Devil of Hell"" (p. 52). Lewis leaves no room for the view that Jesus was no more than a ""great moral teacher,"" since no great moral teacher would claim to be God if he was merely man.3. On Christian LivingAfter setting out the case for Christianity, Lewis discusses various aspects of Christian doctrine and behavior. The purpose and end of Christians is to become like ""little Christs"" while working out their salvation. Lewis discusses a series of relevant questions, including social morality, sexual morality, charity, hope, faith, and the difficulty of Christian living.Of the latter sections of the book, one of Lewis's strongest is chapter 6 of book 3, where he discusses the idea of Christian marriage. He makes the case for the leadership of the man in Christian marriage in a way that is strikingly relevant. He begins from the premise that there needs to be a leader in the relationship and, based on the natural differences between men and women, as well as some anecdotes and arguments based on intuition and some common sense, Lewis states why the leadership of the man, as taught in the Scriptures, is in keeping with human nature. My only criticism to this chapter is that Lewis starts on the premise that disagreement will naturally arise, and because there can be no democracy in a relationship of two, either the man or the wife needs to take the lead. The problem with this is that it ignores the place of leadership even in the absence of disagreement. For example, Adam was Eve's head in prelapsarian Eden, where there was neither sin nor conflict.Lewis also discusses the two aspects of love that married couples will experience, the first being the ""falling in love"" and the second being the ""staying in love"" that should last for the rest of their lives. He writes that ""What we call `being in love' is a glorious state, and, in several ways, good for us. It helps to make us generous and courageous, it opens our eyes not only to the beauty of the beloved but to all beauty, and it subordinates (especially at first) our merely animal sexuality; in that sense, love is the great conqueror of lust. No one in his senses would deny that being in love is far better than either common sensuality or cold self-centeredness. But, as I said before, `the most dangerous thing you can do is to take any one impulse of our own nature and set it up as the thing you ought to follow at all costs'. Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a felling. Now no feeling can be relied on to last in its full intensity, or even to last at all. Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go. And in fact, whatever people say, the sate called `being in love' usually does not last. If the old fairy-tale ending `They lived happily ever after' is taken to mean `They felt for the next fifty years exactly as they felt the day before they were married', then it says what probably never was nor ever would be true, and would be highly undesirable if it were. Who could bear to live in that excitement for even five years? What would become of your work, your appetite, your sleep, your friendships? But, of course, ceasing to be `in love' need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense--love as distinct from `being in love'--is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself. They can retain this love even when each would easily, if they allowed themselves, be `in love' with someone else. `Being in love' first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it"" (p. 108-109). Lewis speaks with remarkable clarity and wisdom for a man who, at the time he wrote the passage, was unmarried."

Lewis hits the bull's-eye in a way that no one else has done before. One could imagine how people devoted to reading the Bible all their lives, or going to mass every Sunday, could miss the salient points of Christianity. His vital argument is that Christianity is not about how much Bible you know, or how to spin a doctrine, or how much you praise your local Priest/Pastor, but how to actually set about doing what Christ asks Christians to do. Namely, how to become a little version of Jesus... a Christian!Instead of breaking down the Bible into a verse by verse tutorial or going through several stages of Catechism, C.S Lewis goes for the characteristics of the Saints and compares them to Jesus to produce a portrait of what God is asking human beings to be like. For all intents and purposes a human being who does not deserve God is called to try and be like God by walking in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. It is never surprising how this very basic of basic requirements of Christianity goes over most heads who are usually too busy hung-up on apologetics or doctrines to get the simplest of commandments which is the message of the Gospel...1. Love the Lord your God2. Love your neighbor as yourselfHow do you do this? By realizing that only Jesus can do it for you. Give up trying to do it yourself and submit to Jesus. That is how it is done.Mere Christianity was specifically designed between 1942 and 1944 to encourage and motivate the British people to fight the Nazi threat. It worked. They won.Book 1 of Mere Christianity discusses our inbuilt nature to know the difference between right and wrong. Lewis calls it the law of human nature. The argument is good because it becomes apparent that common sense should prevail in the world today... but doesn't. We simply know when we are up to no good, or when someone else is up to no good, not because we have been taught what is right and wrong but because of our inbuilt sense of knowing right from wrong that is active somewhere within us. There also seems to be an unseen force that discerns this difference for us, a sense which Lewis believes comes from a higher being. The thing here is that this higher being seems to desire good will. This means that the higher being is probably good and not bad. The onion is that people don't always do what they know to be right. This indicates to Lewis that man seems designed for a higher purpose but mostly achieves a lower standard of being because of doing wrong.Book 2 of Mere Christianity goes right for an explanation of the problems set up by Book 1. Lewis thinks Christianity holds the solution to this problem because things turn out never quite like we expect them to be. That point can not be underestimated. Maybe Jesus did create the world? Maybe there is a spiritual battle taking place in this realm? Lewis believes that a fallen angel called Satan is manipulating people to go against their true nature on planet Earth. Lewis proposes that God values free will over direct intervention and wants human beings to freely choose Jesus to thwart the devil's influence in their daily lives. That is basically it.Book 3 of Mere Christianity is where it is at. This is the big morals and ethics lesson about how to be a better person through Christ Jesus. Lewis talks about the cardinal virtues, prudence (discern our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it), justice (give due to God and neighbor), fortitude (firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good) and temperance (moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods). Lewis then talks about the theological virtues of faith, hope and love. Sexual morality and Christian marriage play a big part in getting good with God. His lesson is very motivating. Forgiveness is a fundamental. The greatest sin of pride gets a big lecture. Book 3 is the real reason to buy Mere Christianity.Book 4 discusses God in the sense that someone who goes through the practice laid out in Book 3 can look forward to what is the next projected step in human evolution which is to voluntarily become an eternal spiritual person through Christ. It contains the barest of doctrines and principles but the chapter called Let's Pretend about the teaching of putting on Christ in a sort of dressing up as Christ routine is a mind blowing concept. Here Lewis indicates that no one deserves to be play acting like Christ but that this is what Christ asks people to do by following the directions Christ laid out, such as praying the `Our Father...', yes calling God our dad! See how such an outrageous mockery this is considering how we do not deserve any of it. It is this orientation of one not deserving anything that gains one everything. It is Christ that leads the way to everlasting life not man leading man to nowhere else but the grave. Yes Christ will kill our old selves in the process but what remains is what we are and not what we have become as a result of reflecting what is bad about this world and not reflecting the goodness that is within it. This is eternal life in heaven being spoken about. The greatest quest a human being can undertake.Mere Christianity is most certainly a Christian essential that will be read more than once for its unlimited value in contributing to good will intensions. You would be hard pressed to find a book as rewarding as this for the little amount you have to read. You will probably do best to read the four Gospels after reading Mere Christianity to figure out more about the Christ who we are asked to put on. Remember to let Christ do the work. We cannot do it ourselves. God bless C.S Lewis!Some additional points however need to be made. This book was written during the 1950s and there has been much progress since then. Being yourself is important. Stop speculating about prophetical end times. Read the Gospels instead. Don't worry about Satan. Concentrate on Jesus instead. Reason before mystical feelings (feelings can be misleading). Check your reasoning with experts. Live life as best you can. God loves you. God is with you always. Pray for the better. Christ's love gets us into heaven. Mistakes are just mistakes. Be careful with legalism (trying to depend too much on the commandments or regulations to get you into heaven and not Jesus). Keep the commandments as best you can though. Christians do develop with the times as they have always done so try to stay in touch. Vatican II aligned Priests are recommended for Catholics. Protestants Christians and Brothers and Sisters in Christ would do best to have a Biblical exegesis that uses the historical critical method instead of just concentrating on direct literal interpretation alone. Also I would add that above all else is honesty and Christianity is not exempt from this because in fact it promotes it. Religion of all kinds should be allowed criticism (Christianity takes full advantage of this when it touches on other religions). A person should honestly evaluate the arguments rather than ignore them. That would be the Christian thing to do."

Lewis explores the common beliefs of all Christian denominations by appealing to his readers logic. Beginning with observations about human nature, he builds a case for the existance of a higher power, that higher power being like the Christian view of God, and how Christianity fulfils the expectations of such a god. He searches into many of the questions that humanity has grappled with for all of time: the existance of God and an explanation of sin and evil, and also discusses the mystery of the Trinity and human redemption through Christ.

1786,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A2TQX03YEHBBQF,Frederick Meekins,0/1,4.0,1251849600,A Review Of Mere Christianity,"C.S. Lewis is renowned as one of the foremost Christian thinkers of the twentieth century. Despite being an Anglican and exhibiting a number of tendencies making him a bit of an iconoclast among his fellow believers, C.S. Lewis has been fondly embraced by a broad swath of the church in part because of his efforts to promote a version of the Christian faith amicable towards all denominations by appealing to what all of these theological niches have in common, which could be referred to as mere Christianity.As such, one of Lewis' best known apologetic texts is titled none other than Mere Christianity. Originally presented as a series of broadcast talks, Lewis vetted much of his text past four members of the clergy --- an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, and a Roman Catholic --- in order to keep denominational idiosyncrasies to a minimum. Because of such conscientious effort, the Christian finds in Mere Christianity a rational defense of the faith of considerable sophistication.Mere Christianity begins as a recitation of what is known as the moral argument for the existence of God. According to Lewis, the moral law consists of the fundamental rules by which the universe operates and to which all residing within are bound. And even though considerable intellectual resources have been expended to deny its existence, not even those making it their life's purpose to undermine these eternal principles can escape from them try as they might. Lewis observes, ""Whenever you find a man who says he does not believe in a real Right and Wrong, you will find the same man going back on this a moment later. He may break his promise to you, but if you try breaking one to him, he will be complaining `It's not fair' before you can say `Jack Robinson' (5).""The very fact that human beings are able to argue that one set of moral claims is superior to another, Lewis observes, is itself proof that some kind of higher law exists. Lewis writes, ""Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer has committed a foul unless there was some kind of agreement about the rules of football (4).""Lewis notes, ""If no set of moral ideas were truer or better than any other, there would be no sense in preferring...Christian morality to Nazi morality...If your moral ideas can be truer, and those of the Nazis less true, there must be something --- some real morality --- for them to be true about (11)."" Thus, the standard by which human moralities are judged stem from a source apart and above them.From establishing that natural law exists, Lewis moves on to examine where this eternal law originates from. Lewis postulates there are approximately two sources that this law could possibly originate from: the materialist view that the principles governing the universe arose through a process of chance and the religious view that the universe was established by a conscious mind. And since the law comes to us in the form of principles and instructions, this would seem to conclude that the promulgator of this law would have to be mind rather than inanimate matter.Despite the fact that the universe was meant to run according to moral law, it is obvious from a quick look around that the moral agents operating within it fail to live up to these noble ideals as we are regularly aware of even our own shortcomings. As such, the universe requires a divine intervention to set things right. Lewis writes, ""Enemy occupied territory --- that is what the world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed...and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage (36)."" This king is none other than Jesus, whom from his own claims, must be God or, as Lewis famously points out, is a lunatic ""on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg or a devilish liar (41)."" It was the primary purpose of Jesus to suffer and die so that our sins might be forgiven so that we might be made whole in Him.Fundamental as this message is to man's eternal salvation, Mere Christianity is also full of practical observations less cosmic and more down to earth. Lewis writes, ""Theology is practical. Consequently, if you do not listen to Theology...It will mean that you have a lot of...bad muddled, out of date ideas (120.)"" Many of theology's practical concerns manifest themselves in the form of morality.Lewis lists morality as being concerned with three matters: harmony between individuals, the inner life of the individual, and the general purpose of human life as a whole (57). Lewis observes that different beliefs about the universe will naturally result in different behaviors and those closest to the truth will produce the best results (58).Lewis demonstrates how this phenomena manifests itself in a number of ethical spheres, sex being one of interest to just about all people. It is this obsession with sex, Lewis point out, that shows just how out of whack contemporary morality has become. Lewis comically comments that the level to which this biological impulse has been elevated in our own society is akin to a land where the inhabitants have such a prurient interest in food beyond nourishment and wholesome pleasure that the inhabitants watch a plate containing a mutton chop that is uncovered just before the lights go out (75). Ironically, Lewis points out, such deviancy is not usually the result of starvation but rather overindulgence.Though Lewis is witty in regards to most issues he addresses, even in regards to this beloved Oxford professor, the Christian must remember to be a Berean and measure even his formidable intellect by the standard of Biblical truth. Unfortunately, there are at least two matters that must be approached with caution.Lewis likens the process of change we go through as Christians to the biological theory of recapitulation where it is believed an embryo passes through the various phases of evolution during development in the womb. Of the process, Lewis writes, ""We were once like vegetables, and once rather like fish; it was only at a later stage that we became like human babies (159).""One hopes that had Lewis lived until more technologically advanced times that he would have not retained this scientifically erroneous theory. For at its most innocent, it is used to justify Darwinisim and from Lewis' statement one could very well use it to justify abortion.From another passage, it would seem Lewis tottered dangerously close to a ""proto-universalism"" in his thought. Lewis writes, ""There are people in other religions who are being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ without knowing it (162).""John 14:6 says, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" And Acts 4:12 says, ""Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.""In writing Mere Christianity, Lewis does a commendable job overall of balancing the theoretical and practical concerns of the faith. As such, Mere Christianity will no doubt continue as a classic apologetics text for decades to come.by Frederick Meekins"

The primary advantage of this work is that it is clearly written, and uses many analogies to help illustrate its points to the reader. The major disadvantage, however, is that these analogies and analysis are far too simplistic. By introducing an analogy Lewis merely assumes it as proof of the very thing he is trying to argue. Page after page is filled with analogy and reasoning which seems to rest on an undefended assumption. His argument that Christ was either ""Divine or a Madman"" for calling himself the Son of God, and that therefore we must believe the former is really ludicrous. Any number of persons have been false prophets and made false claims, but because the claims are outrageous doesn't mean we must accept them. If Christ is any different, he has not shown how Christ's ideas were different, which is where he should have gone. I write this from the perspective of one friendly to the Christian religion and its ethics, and simply don't think Lewis has done a very good job in arguing for the Christian religion. Too many of his arguments are really thinly veiled theological assumptions that are uncritically presented in two-dimensional depth."

He doesn't get caught up in anything but the core and substantive matters of the faith.

Wright, Lewis will always be relevant to the thinking follower of Christ who will not become complacent in thought or life."
1793,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",21/25,5.0,1076112000,Merely wonderful...,"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a `very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to `experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.The book looks at beliefs, both from a `natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, `When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the `leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the `new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.`Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - `The Case for Christianity', `Christian Behaviour', and `Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made."

I found that these underlined passages were still applicable. I recorded several new thoughts to aid my understanding of God.Lewis takes on the tough issues facing Christians. For example, we know what morality is but do not practice it completely. When we understand how much more we have to do to be a better person, we are progressing in the right direction.I was particularly interested in two thoughts from Lewis' book.1. Try to become a better person by taking one step at a time. Ask for God's help. This is really good advice. It works!!2. Religious leaders who politicize God's word are not working for God.

1798,B000HKRIJO,Mere Christianity,,AR9FNSPEE9B77,S. Pollock,7/9,5.0,1132531200,Has the power to change lives,"Probably one of the great books of the last century. Lewis approaches Christianity as late convert who previously held well-thought out philosophical objections to its teachings. In Mere Christianity, he outlines and refutes many such objections such as:(1) ""'Isn't what you call the Moral Law simply our herd instinct and hasn't it been devloped just like our other instincts?'""; and(2) ""'Isn't what you call the Moral Law just a social convention, something that is put into us by education?'""What is wonderful about Lewis' writing is that he draws delightful, imaginative analogies which he expresses in simple, unpretentious language, but which are nonetheless thoughtful and profound.As a university student, I frequently hear variations on these two objections made by students and professors to deny the existence of natural law. In his defence of natural law and critique of moral relativism, Lewis argues that while it (was, and remains) fasionable to argue that good and evil cannot be objectively defined because conception of morals have differed in space and time, this is not so. He asks us to imagine a country where people were admired for cowardice; where men felt proud for betraying their friends. In no society or age has selfishness or cowardice ever been admired, nor generosity and courage condemned. Lewis goes on to argue, persuasviely, that morals are NOT simply a matter of taste and opinion.In regards to objection (1) mentioned above, Lewis argues that while we do indeed possess a herd instinct (a natural desire to help another person), a DESIRE to help another is different in kind from feeling that you OUGHT to help whether you so desire or not. Lewis says you may feel two natural desires - the herd instinct to help another (and put yourself in harms way, and the instinct to self-preservation (to not risk harm). But human beings feel a third thing which tells us what instinct we OUGHT to follow. This thing which judges between the two cannot be one or the other. A sheet of music which tells you what note to play on the keyboard cannot be itself a note. Therefore: ""The Moral Law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are merely the keys.""In regards to (2) Lewis argues that like our multiplication tables, morals are objective truths, not ""social conventions."" The fact that we learn morals from our parents does not prove otherwise. We also learn math from our parents but that doesn't make mathematics a social construct (and therefore subjective and relative). Moreover, Lewis points out that: ""If no set of moral ideas were truer or better than any other, there would be no sense in preferring civilised morality to savage morality, Christian morality to Nazi morality . . . The moment you say that one set of moral ideas can be better than another, you are, in fact, measuring them both by a standard, saying that one of them conforms to the standard more nearly than the other. But the standard that measures two things is something different from either. You are, in fact, comparing them both with some Real Morality, admitting that there is such a thing as a real Right, independent of what people think, and that some people's ideas get nearer to that Real right than others."" If we deny this transcendent, objective standard, we lose our ability to object to the actions of any other person or state.Lewis exposes the intellectual poverty of moral relativism, and in this modern age of cynicism and disbelief, his argument for the transcedent truth of Christ's teachings are needed more than ever. For those who find their faith faltering this book will help to sustain it. And for those who are not Christian but are curious and are open-minded enough to look beyond modern caricaturation, this book may surprise you."

That really threw me for a loop, and if you don't pay attention to that you'll be confused the whole way through. The first couple of chapters moved a little sluggishly for me, but after I got to a point of interest this was a quick read for me. The thing that makes this book so interesting is the underlying theme. The whole point is someone will double cross anyone if they think they'll benefit from it in the long run. It also shows just how much revenge can cloud a person's mind. This was one of the first books I've been given to read for an assignment that I actually found meaningful. Much better than the ""Oeidipus,"" or ""Alice in Wonderland"" by far.

1819,B0007K33F2,"Monte Cristo,",,,,3/3,5.0,1012608000,"""Count"" This Novel as a Classic","WARNING: May include ""spoilers"".""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is the most extraordinary book I have ever read.The first aspect that makes it so interesting is its variety. ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is usually described as an action-adventure novel about revenge. It is that, but it is also much, much more. It is a fantasy novel, a romance novel, a mystery novel, a horror novel, a comedy, and a social satire. There is something in this novel that will please nearly every reader.The second aspect of the novel that causes it to be so wonderful is the characters. There is, of course, first and foremost, Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. Dantes is an amazingly charismatic character. He is also incredibly complex, being at once a philanthropist and a sadist, a man who is remarkably intuitive about what motivates his enemies but who at the same time is frequently oblivious to the feelings of the people who he cares about. For example, he thinks that Haydee, a beautiful Greek-princess-turned-slave, loves him like a father. He's right about the love part, but not the ""like a father"" part. In parts of the novel, he appears God-like, in others, he is compared, not entirely without justification, to the Devil. Edmond Dantes is fascinating.Then there are the secondary characters. The secondary characters in this novel are such that you can't help but wish that many of them had their own novel for which they could act as protagonist. There's Albert de Morcerf, Eugenie Danglars, and Haydee. Of the three, Haydee is my personal favourite. She is, initially, somewhat annoying due to her hyper-sensitive, cloying, and comedically melodramatic nature. Gradually, however, as the reader learns more about her tragic past, it becomes extremely easy to sympathize with her and care for her. She later demonstrates her inner strength when she aids in the ruination of Albert de Morcerf, one of the men who had betrayed Edmond. Both she and the Count have gone through similar experiences and are remarkably alike, which helps makes the novel's conclusion logical and rewarding.An additional aspect of the novel that makes it qualify as a classic are its themes and the way the novel presents those themes. Dumas pokes fun at the aristocracy, mocks the often contradictory social values of his day, and philosophizes about revenge, love, hate, and philosophy itself, among other things.Some readers have complained that the plot is too complex and confusing. I, for one, found that not being certain about what the Count's plans were made the novel all the more interesting. As well, some readers have said that too much of the plot relies on coincidence, luck, etc. True, some portions of the novel stretch believability, however, I did not find that this in any way damaged my enjoyment of the novel. The story is, in many ways, allegorical, as a result, the occasional implausible plot twist makes little difference in whether a reader enjoys the story or not.It's impossible to summerize what makes this novel so wonderful in a simple review. I strongly advise against reading the abridged version, because there's something worthwhile on every page of the full-length novel. ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is that rare specimen of a book that manages to be intellectually and emotionally satisfying, and, at the same time, is extremely fun to read."

But I've asked so many people about this book, and all that I've known to read it have unanimously praised it. I don't think you can go wrong, but make sure you do the research before picking one specific book.And finally, I'd say don't pick a book with an ugly picture of the Count on the front. He's supposed to be a relatively good-looking guy, and an ugly picture on the cover can psychologically influence a partial opinion towards him contrary to the descriptions of the text. ;)"

I especially love how Dumas protrays each character--true, they can get a bit mixed up at times, but it didn't deter me!--with deep thought for each of their personalities and proper actions (At least, I thought their actions were very appropriate in proportion to the descriptions of them).Also, the plot is interesting and intense enough to keep you immersed. Sometimes Dumas explains things a bit too much, but skimming through those parts hasn't damaged the story (for me, at least). I highly recommend The Count as a leisure book, or for anytime, really.

When setting eyes on the outline of this large rock, it's not hard to imagine something mysterious associated with it. In fact, these days, you can take a boat near the island to fish, but if you get too close, military boats come along to shoo you off.I won't provide a summary here - the Book Description on the product page does that quite well enough. What I will say is, as a story, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" has everything - everything! Deception! Intrigue! Romance! Ambition! Honor and vengeance, redemption and forgiveness. More than one character sinks to the depths of utter despair. All that's missing is a bit of swashbuckling, which might have appeared, except that the story took a different turn...Towards the beginning, it would probably help to know just a little about French politics around the time of Napolean. You can get by on context, though I did find myself reading up on some Wikipedia entries.As the story progresses, it does get a bit soap opera-y, as all the characters eventually come together, and everyone happens to know everyone else. But, all the connections do make for a great story, so I'm not complaining. If this is your first time reading the book, it might help to write down the characters in order to keep track of them.Some people might call this book a tome, but don't let that discourage you!

I`m not saying it`s the greatest book on earth--there are flaws sometimes in character development, and the overuse of coincidences--but the story itself is a gem unrivalled anywhere. When it comes to weaving a complex plot rife with fascinating characters, Dumas is a master; and each scene is instilled with just the necessary amount of dramatic tension and foreshadowing. Never once does the story slow its pace, yet without once detracting from its depth and power. The characters are often thrown into situations that are literally a matter of life and death, and suspense becomes the reader`s constant companion. But the most compelling element in the story is Edmond Dantes himself, aka the Count of Monte Cristo, looming like a spectral shadow over the bright spectacle of French wealth portrayed here--a shadow with a broken heart and needs of which he is hardly aware, so intent is he on becoming a pitiless agent of revenge. The book`s main flaw, I thought, was the abrupt resolution of his relationship with Haydee--she seemed more like a plot device than a real person. Other flaws consist of contrived plot scenarios which would be unacceptable today, but which to me at least, with their exuberant spontaneity, make this book even more of a joy to read."

It's about a twenty-year old man named Edmond Dantes, whose early fame (as a young, newly assigned ship captain) is short lived. Jealous of his success, a few bad men take actions that, on his wedding day, lead to his arrest and long imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. After leaving the prison, he again gains fame, as well as fortune, learns all that he can about the men whose actions led to his demise, uses the information to concoct acts of revenge, ingratiates himself with the bad guys and their family members, and strikes. Although I'm not a fan of spending the time required to read really long books, in this case, I'm glad I did. An amazingly easy read, The Count of Monte Cristo has a complicated, well-thought out plot (though that involving V near the end is hokey and the ultimate fate of H troublesome) and great characters.

They can stand the test of time from 10 years to 100 years beyond, due to their meaningful story lines which everyone can both relate to and have different interpretations of. The Count of Monte Cristo has all these characteristic of a classic story. It is a story of revenge, love, hatred and the second chances in life one may be lucky enough to receive. Even though this story is almost 200 years old it still appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.Edmond Dantes is wrongly accused and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. After spending 14 years in a horrendous prison he miraculously escapes and uses his new fortune given to him by a prison mate to live out his new life of enormous wealth and his quest for revenge. This seeking of revenge captured me along the ride with Edmond Dates' use of wit and internal hatred towards others to seek revenge on those who destroyed his life. It came to my discovery through the Count of Monte Cristo's experiences and actions that people back in 1800's were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, manipulative and vengeful as people can be today in modern times.Alexandre Dumas builds a captivating and rich plot throughout his story which makes the reader wonder what will happen next and what the consequences may be. The theme of love, hatred, happiness, vengeance and forgiveness is something everyone can relate to since they are feelings we have all felt. My negative critique for this book is the fact that it was a struggle to keep all the 40+ characters in order. The French names I am not familiar with as an English speaker, were confusing at times.I found this book intriguing because this story portrays the evil nature of the human spirit while at the same time teaching a lesson in the possibility of Karma and how eventually people will end up paying for their wrongdoings.

Gardner,5/5,5.0,1035331200,Human Nature in a Compelling Narrative,"Compelling Description of Human Nature and MotiveThere is really no way to accurately review The Count of Monte Cristo. A simple review of its plot would be unfair to the genius of Dumas and to the profound insights into human nature and motivation that this book contains. Likewise, to approach this book merely for its psychological and anthropological value would be to ignore the imaginative flights of fancy and vistas for the mind's eye that this tome affords. Similarly, to approach The Count of Monte Cristo merely as a fable or a fairy tale is to forget that it is an accurate historical novel portraying the Franco-European mindset, as well as a crystal-clear exposition of the many social issues, conventions, and commonly-held fancies that characterized France throughout the post-Napoleonic era. However, for purely literary purposes, and due to constraints of space and time, a brief sketch of Dumas' masterpiece will have to suffice. Ideally, however, you will stop reading right here and get your hands on the book, thus skirting my woefully inadequate attempt to review this masterpiece fairly and coherently.Dumas' narrative follows the story of a virtuous young man struggling to come of age and find his place. However, in the classic battle of good versus evil, he is imprisoned unfairly and robbed of all that was dear to him. Eventually, he comes into great wealth and knowledge, escapes from captivity, and single-mindedly sets about to be the instrument of Divine vengeance on those who had previously denied him life and love. Along the way, he re-learns the value of friendship, and, having seen justice brought upon his enemies, finds unexpected love in an ending that is a triumphant, crescendoing testimony to the indomitable quality of the human spirit - and the mercy of God.Throughout this tale, Dumas teaches us of forgiveness, of love, of anger and hate, and reaches out to the reader with an intensity that can only come from a spirit that itself drank deeply of such emotions. Indeed, the story of Edmond Dantes - from the lowly but principled pauper to the rash, vengeful yet popular prince - smacks at times of Dumas' own rise from obscurity as an unknown mulatto to the powerful and respected literary force that he became.Granted, there are times when Dumas' heroes - like all heroes - take on superhuman qualities. However, they are not the indestructible supermen that mar much of today's literature. Instead, they are all too human - flawed sufficiently that their exploits are believable, and human enough that the reader often finds himself dialoguing with them, arguing for or against their intents and actions. In this way, it is the enduring human quality of the book - the ability for us to reach out across the better part of two centuries and dialogue freely and coherently with them, and to recognize the players and actors as fellow humans above all else - that makes it so compelling. Likewise, it is that essence of humanness that stands as the greatest tribute to Dumas.An insightful, powerful, fast-paced, and moving read, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those books that does not end when the last page is turned and the book closed. Its imaginative power transcends the written page with timeless force, calling us to a greater, more vivid plane of existence and self-expression.Now get the book!- Benjamin Gene Gardner"

The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas.

It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died. He is then betrayed by two people he thought were his fiends, Monsieur Danglars and Fernand. Danglars was jealous of Edmond because he was the likely candidate to be the captain of the pharaon and Danglars wanted the job. Fernand was jealous that Mercedes was in love with Edmond. The public prosecutor M. de Villefort confiscated Edmond's only proof of innocence. The reason is that the evidence proved that de Villefort's father is a Bonapartist, which would put the prosecutor out of the favor of the court. Edmond was sentenced to life in the infamous dungeon, the Chateau d'If. There he makes friends with a priest. They develop a father, son friendship. He spends fourteen long, hard years in jail. He has a daring escape and finally leaves the oppressing dungeon. He then plans his revenge on his enemies. He joins a smuggler ship to protect his identity. He returns to his village, to find his father dead from hunger. He protects himself by changing his name to the Count of Monte Cristo, and travels to find his enemies with his new found fortune. He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book. I enjoyed the book and I appreciated the author's hard work to write a fine piece of literature. It is an adventure story unlike any other, which involves a great deal of mystery. The use of one character in more than one role might be at first confusing, but it only adds to the drama of the story. The story is an intricate web of what the word vengeance really means. The plot is forever rolling and unraveling until the final resolution. You will be on your toes for most of the book and apprehensive to see what is yet to come. I greatly enjoyed the passion of the protagonist, to make his enemies feel the hurt and despair he went through. The plot is nicely developed to intrigue the minds of young adults and to make them think. The reader feels the joy of Edmond his sorrow is also felt.There are a few negative parts of the book. The length of the book may intimidate the reader at first and might deter them away from it. Edmond playing more than one character could also confuse you at first until you read more about the book. There was also the use of many different characters, which confused me as the story progressed. The positive aspect of the book was incalculable. The author's use of plot was very good and used wisely, this added to the quality of writing. I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to anybody ages 13-up. This book makes you feel the magic of reading, so enjoy it."

You don't really need the frosting, but the frosting is what gives a cake it's delicious flavor. The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which ought to be read unabridged, if only for the richness and flavor of the text. The evolution of Edmond Dantes from sailor to prisoner to Count of Monte Cristo is enthralling. Alexander Dumas's book is captivating. It is hard to set aside CoMC, as the characters are extremely interesting and well-developed. It's not like the antagonists are straight-up bad guys with no redeeming qualities, they are just people who make bad choices and act out of self-interest.Essentially, the moral provided in this HUGE tome is that revenge is a dish best served cold. In order to understand why I say this, I shall provide some backstory. Three men known to Edmond Dantes, all jealous of him in some way, one wants his job, the other wants his girlfriend, plot a way to put Edmond Dantes in prison. Their plan works and Dantes is arrested. He's thrown in prison without a trial. Dantes spends awhile in jail and thinks of nothing but his revenge. Eventually, Dantes escapes and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Luckily, for the reader we get to see the entire evolution of Dantes, we see him in his darkest moments as well as in his crowning glory. His revenge is most apt.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to be transported into another time as well as for someone who is looking to fall in love with well-developed characters. There are many editions out there, I recommend the Robin Buss unabridged translation published by Penguin Classics. Buss's translation is fantastic and readable, the phrasing is not awkward at all, as in other translations. Also, Buss's translation includes all of the naughty bits - i.e. one sex scene, some drug use, and a dash of homosexuality."
1865,B0007K33F2,"Monte Cristo,",,A3KD25QWG3VYK4,ddsharper,3/4,5.0,1196985600,"Great Author, Wonderful Book","I am so pleased to see that the Count of Monte Cristo has moved up to about 2880 in Amazon's rating out of over 6 million books. It was about 280,000 3 years ago when I checked. Imagine, a book over 150 years old has again, like it did when he was alive, captured the world. Penguin was perspicacious in providing the first complete English translation of this inspirational classic written around 1840! I have read it 3 times and never tire of it.It is difficult to add anything of value to the fantastic comments already made on the site, as the book has over 5 out of 5 stars and I agree with every one of the reviewers. I am thrilled that this generation is reading the author that I personally consider the best author that ever lived. It goes to show that true art is immortal. One member of royalty, on their deathbed in the 1800s, said they read Dumas because he gave life in his works. I agree.The book, as well as his over 1000 works, is riveting, enthralling and full of plot twists and great characters.Alexandre Dumas was the ultimate wordsmith and studied, and studied, on his own, to master his craft, never getting his dues until recently, by the French government. They dug him up from his hometown of Villers Cotterets, France, and moved his body to the Pantheon, finally calling him a national treasure. I read his biography and he wanted to be buried in Villers Cotterets. The move was disheartening in that the town lost revenue from tourists. Also, you can find pictures of the Chateau he built on the web. The man's personal life is as fascinating as this book, but beware, there are many lies circulating about his father, a brigadier general in Napoleon's army, being born out of wedlock, as well as Dumas himself. Neither is true, according to his 5 volume autobiography.Current reviewers also love to emphasize the illegitimacy of his son, an author in his own right, named Alexandre Dumas, fils (Jr.), the father being pere. No child is illegitimate and the two were close. People were admitedly jealous of Dumas then and, in my opinion, today. The writing academy only recently admitted him and that was a goal he held when he was alive. Great men, superior men, as Dumas points out in his narrative about some of his characters, including Dantes, are generally hated. Dumas was one of those hated men.If you loved this book, I'd suggest going to cadytech and checking out his other works. In the Count of Monte Cristo, Dumas's ability to capture the emotional spectrum of the human heart, to portray a wide array of human interactions, his mastery of dialog, demonstration of the conflicts of man versus man and man versus himself, his ability to paint descriptive pictures and completely draw readers into well defined and thought out plots, his expertise in interjecting philosophical truisms as food for thought, to make you feel the experiences of the protagonist and construct a perfect story of revenge, indeed one of the best ever stories of revenge, in my opinion, all make this my favorite book of all time.Dumas loved Shakespeare and many other authors and if you are as interested in the life of this fascinating man, as I am, please don't forget to go to cadytech. It is maintained by one of the most prominent translators of Dumas's works from french. Also, for another good read by this author, check out the complete 3 musketeers musketeers series, comprised of 5 books: The 3 Musketeers, 20 Years After, 10 Years Later, The Count de Bragelonne, and finally The Man in the Iron Mask. Dumas actually wrote 1 book but it was later divided into the 5 mentioned above. I could go on and on but will stop now."
1866,B0007K33F2,"Monte Cristo,",,,,0/0,4.0,890265600,This is a book that has many insights into the nature of man,"This book is a great book. The way the plot is structured, the way Edmond Dantes slowly takes his revenge, to make it all the more painful on his enemies.The setup is ingenious--Dantes is in the best situation he could possibly be in. He is getting married, and is going to become the captain of the Pharaon, a ship that he is first mate on...and then, out of the blue, some police come in, and he is put away in the Chateau d' If, an island prison, to die.Dumas is a master of conveying emotion. At some parts of the book, one is forced to be depressed, and share the melancholy with the characters in the book. The arrow of anger that Dantes must feel toward his enemies is shot from the pages and into one's heart. And the happiness when Dantes is going to be married and at other joyous occations is almost an aroma in the air, rising from the pages of the book.Unfortunately, this book does, like every book ever written, has some aspects to be criticized. First and foremost, the length: 1074 pages is quite a bit for the average reader! Even the abridged version is 500-something pages. And there are also French sayings, anecdotes, and words that you must look at the footnotes to understand. Of course, in the abridged edition, it doesn't even have footnotes. But overall, this book is an enjoyable book, and unlike some other books written by amateurs, this book makes you think about the very nature of mankind."
1867,B0007K33F2,"Monte Cristo,",,,,16/16,5.0,1137024000,The Count of Monte Christo,"The Conte of Monte ChristoThe Count of Monte Christo, written by Alexandre Dumas, is about a man named Edmond Dantes who experiences many twists and turns in his life. Edmond Dantes is a respected sailor who was going to marry a girl named Mercedes. Edmond was going to be the captain of his own ship and make a living. He lived in France in 1825 with his father. He is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist (a friend of Napoleon's) on the day of his wedding. Two men planned this accusation and they both benefited from his disappearance. Edmond was sent to a horrible prison and after a month an old man tunnels into his cell. The old man becomes Edmond's teacher in language, manners, and math. He also tells him the names of his two enemies, Danglars and Fernand. Edmond is filled with the power of vengeance and vows to avenge himself. Together, they plan their escape but the old man is hit by a disease. Before the old man dies, he gives Edmond a treasure map. Edmond uses quick thinking to devise a plan to escape and retrieve the treasure. Edmond gets out of jail and recovers the treasure making himself rich. He starts to do good deeds for others and changes his name to the Count of Monte Christo. The Count (Edmond) begins to slowly avenge himself while he helps out ""Edmond Dantes'"" loyal friends even though it is Edmond who is really helping them.My favorite quotes are ""I have instilled in your heart vengeance"" and ""For the last four nights I have been watching over you."" These quotes show the two main meanings of this book, which are Edmond getting vengeance and Edmond helping his friends. The Count of Monte Christo is a fiction/adventure book that tells Edmond Dantes life story and his adventures. Alexandre Dumas creates great pictures in my mind with his fabulous details. He made the characters consistently sound the same in their dialogue. He used wonderful language and added a little bit of humor in some parts. I was amazed how he mixed English and French together.I would recommend this book to fourteen or fifteen year olds because it is hard to comprehend and the language is old fashioned. I think that it would be hard for younger children to keep track of all the characters. The Count of Monte Christo is unlike any other book that I have read. It is the only book that has had me guessing all the way through. I would infer something and then I was completely wrong, which makes the book exciting. I would compare the Count of Monte Christo to the Lord of the Rings because they are both great adventures. They are extremely well written books and I like them both. Another book series that I compare The Count of Monte Christo to is the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt series because in both of the books there are great schemes. In the books, written by Clive Cussler, the people who make up the ingenious schemes are bad. In The Count of Monte Christo, the good guy is the schemer who plots his revenge. They both have good schemes but what separates them is that the good guy is outsmarting the bad guys, Fernand and Danglars. The Count of Monte Christo is the best genre it could be. Very few fantasy or mystery books that I have read matched up to it. The Harry Potter series and Eragon were also good books that I would compare to The Count of Monte Christo.This book was really addicting and I read the whole thing in three days. I was completely hooked by the twentieth page because of the author's detail. I could not put down the book; I even brought it in the car for a two minute drive. The book ended with a twist that I never saw coming."

However, having plowed my way to the end, I am tempted to classify this along with ""Dracula"" as a ""classic"" novel whose reputation rests more on its great beginning than on its middle and end. It was great up to about chapter 30 (describing the betrayal, imprisonment and escape of the hero, and the reward of his friends). However, once the story starts to sink in to the prolonged revenge, it starts to lose its way for me.After chapter 30, the hero becomes a sort of divinely inspired madman, who imagines himself to be, and apparently is, a mere tool and agent of God's justice. His behavior transcends moral laws, his plans transcend human intelligence, and he becomes impossible to identify with as a character. Fortunately, there are plenty of other characters, and the story, from this point on, is rarely told from the mysterious Count's point of view. If you are willing to settle in and be patient, you can have some fun watching the weaving, interacting sprawling plot threads. Even so, when it was all said and done, it was wrapped up in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth.I would not, however, recommend reading an abridged version.

Alexandre Dumas is an excellent writer but seems to accentuate too many subplots that are unimportant. He also focuses on numerous small and confusing characters.The basic plot, is about human nature, particularly revenge of a young man named Edmond Dant&eacute;s. At the age of nineteen, Dant&eacute;s has a series of important events happen to him. He is convicted of being a Bonapartist by two jealous rivals. He is unable to marry the lovely Mercedes and he is no longer capable become captain of the Pharaon, the merchant ship, on which he used to work on as a first mate. He is thrown into the notorious dungeon, Chateau d'if, for fourteen years. He escapes with a large secret: the map to the famed treasure of Spada. Naturally, he'll use it for his revenge. As they say, the rich can do anything.The book has so many intricate subplots and minor characters that the real plot seems to be lost in a hurricane of court intrigues, treasonous affairs, and numerous social gatherings. There are at least nine chapters concerning meals and balls, ranging from brunches to dinners, suppers to breakfasts, from a mere ball to a summer ball, and everything in-between. If you understand the difference between a baron and a count, then these things would obviously make sense, and may even be interesting to you. If you don't know the difference, prepare to be a little confused.Getting to the action takes a while, but when it comes, Dumas gives you a good read. From being captured by bandits, meeting Dantes's old fianc&eacute; (who is now married to his arch rival and has a child), to getting even with all those evil men who planned his imprisonment. Although, if you're not at the action yet, get ready for a long, not-so interesting read. Dumas, still manages to throw in some unimportant details and small talk in-between the action. You can't just go skipping around the book, because there are too many important details embedded in the small talk. If you don't read every word, I guarantee you'll get lost.This book is jam-packed with murderous action, so if that sounds good to you, you should consider reading this book. If you are looking for a challenge then this is a book for you. We recommend this book to older, more advanced readers."

For some reason (perhaps because the name was familiar to me from childhood), I saw it as a young readers book. Now, at the wise? old age of 69, my daughter, who is also an avid reader, suggested that I read it. She claimed it was one of the best books she's read. Normally, we have the same taste in literature. My daughter has read most of the ""classics"" and read the majority of them one after the other several years ago.After reading several pages, I gave up on it. While it is a fine work of literature for sure, I found a lot of the descriptive paragraphs to be repetitive and interrupted the flow of the story. Another issue for me personally was the amount of French content which I realize, is no fault of the author but a fault of my own for not knowing how to pronounce the French names, places, references etc.Another reason I gave it up was that while I found it to be a very cleverly written book, to me it was a childish/simplistic storyline.If it had been a smaller book (it's huge), I probably would have persevered."

This novel is a breathtaking, in-your-face story that spans an entire continent in order to get the full picture accross to its readers.Dumas gave so much life to the characters he created, and though it is sometimes hard to figure out what is going on at that very moment, you are always helped out a few pages down--that is the gift that Dumas brings to his readers!

Most of books I read are popular paperbacks I see on best seller list. One day I was at the library and saw this thick book for a $1 and I thought I would give it a try. Even if I don't like it, I am out of a $1 so no big deal. I won't bore you with the story or the translation because that's not why you are reading these reviews on Amazon website. You are looking for a reason to pick up this yellowpage thick book that you already know the plot so allow me to give you several.Story in this book is not what you expect as it is much more detailed and insightful to the movies and young adult versions. Story is darker than what you expect so that's a good thing. Also, finding a good book about revenge is difficult enough so stick with a proven winner. Certain lines in this book adhere to your brain like it's been spread liberally with crazy glue. I sometimes write "".. now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked."" on my forearm whenever I have a business meeting with some jerk I cannot stand. Lines like this sticks to your head and it lingers like a noxious fart in public toilet.Let me leave you with this.

I watched the movie that came out in 2000 or 2001 and really enjoyed it but after reading this book, I think I would really HATE the movie. If you're looking for an incredibly intricate plot line then read the book and skip the movie. The movie takes pieces of the plot and twists it in such a way that leaves the viewer with little to know surprise or suspense. Alexandre Dumas writes in such a way as to put the reader right in the very scene that is being played out. As I read this book I felt like I was sitting in the conversations taking place amongst the characters. I don't know how he does it (I'm not a writer!) but he does it quite well.Believe it or not, I've not been much of a reader until recently (I'm 30, if that tells you anything). When I found this book and saw how long it was I thought I was jumping in over my head, however, I quickly found that this was a book that I could NOT put down and one that I did NOT want to end! One of the highlights in the book (at least for me) is how you'll be cruising along with the story and tracking pretty well with it when all of a sudden you take a hard left turn and can't figure out who is who and what is what. Just when you think Dumas has lost his mind and can't write to save his life, he pulls out this magic thread that pulls these mystery pieces together and out of nowhere you have a new and amazing concept introduced in a way you didn't expect. Understanding that these threads are intertwined into the story helps the reader get through chapters that may not make sense at the time but have a huge payoff in the end.One last thing, I have only read this version which is unabridged (nothing has been cut out). I've not read the abridged version (pieces of the story have been cut out to shorten it) but I can't imagine that it holds a candle to the unabridged, of course you'll have to determine that for yourself. I'm an all or nothing individual and so of course I wanted every aspect of the story included, I'm so glad I did!

It formed the core of two of his earlier novels, but nowhere else did he devote to it so much study and development as he did in his mid-19th Century gothic romance, ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Readers who choose abridged versions of this unsurpassed tale of vengeance short-change themselves, because it's only in the many sub-plots, the painstakingly depicted details of French elite society of France's Second Republic, and the subtle twists and interweaving of the activities of the novel's many characters that we truly come to appreciate this masterpiece in its in-depth exploration of what constitutes revenge in all its hideous terror and in all its glorious satisfaction.Edmund Dant&egrave;s suffers at the hands of brutal enemies, spends 14 years in one of the most awful prisons human perversity could devise, and through a series of suspense-filled circumstances gains his freedom - and a fortune - before spending an additional 10 years meticulously planning his revenge. He leaves nothing to chance. He watches. He waits. He is infinitely patient, and patience when wielded by skillful hands can be a weapon sharper than a sword. Edmund Dant&egrave;s, through years of training and practice, becomes dispassionate, cold, supremely calculating, supremely confident and capable - and implacable. The Count of Monte Cristo is born, and slowly, inexorably, he brings down retribution on those who betrayed him or forgot him rotting in prison. Even his former fianc&eacute;e, the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s (who certainly is no Homeric Penelope), does not escape unscathed.And in the end, for revenge to be complete, it must be cathartic. Dumas, after much carnage and financial destruction, leaves us with a few green shoots of love rising from the ashes, closing his magnificent saga with the line, "". . . all human wisdom [is] contained in these two words - `wait' and `hope.'''"

Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version."

Crawford,2/2,5.0,1177113600,"good addition to the classics, though I am not sure why B&N publishes these","This is a good edition in English of a wonderful reading experience, which I looked over in a store. Is there anything new in it? No. But it is inexpensive and fairly well translated, tho nothing compares to Dumas pere's astonishing detail and clarity in the original language. Alas, it is abridged, which is dumbing it down in my opinion.This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and transformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society of the Restoration. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book (unabridged version). At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth and ambition are beyond the simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels if that isyour bag.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it in the original, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible, so why domb it down?Highest recommendation."

That part gives me chills all over, the COunt has vanquished his doubt, it was God's will that he does what he does. I own several copies of this book, and always have one around to read parts of.

Set up to marry the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, recently made the captain of his own ship, and well liked by many, he is the envy of three men who set out to destroy him. Dant&egrave;s, ignorant of the political scene, has agreed to take a letter from Napoleon to some Bonapartists in Paris. Using this as fodder, Danglars, Mondego and Caderousse bring him to court to be tried for treason.Dant&egrave;s is convicted, and once in prison meets a man named Abb&eacute; Faria. He is a priest who educated Dantes into a well-rounded, well-informed man. He leaved Dantes with the knowledge of many riches on the Isle of Monte Cristo, and how to get to the place. When Faria dies, Dantes uses his shroud as a means of escape, and is thrown into the sea.He reaches Monte Cristo and is astounded at all the riches. Disguising himself as a priest, he travells to Marseille. Upon arrival he learns that his father has died and that his fiancee Mercedes has married Mondego. He also is told about the plot to frame him.Ten years later, he reinstates himself into French society, giving himself the title Count of Monte Cristo. Nobody recognizes him with the exception of Mercedes. He uses his knowledge of his old aversaries to bring about their ruin in very public and humiliating ways.Not all of his motives are driven by vengance, however. He also sets out to reward everyone who helped him over the years, and does this through his extensive riches and influence.Overall the novcel is very intriguing and exciting. It is full of action filled escapes and duels which add to the excitement. There is an air of mystery around Dantes that gives it the air of a thriller novel. It is full of plot twists and intrigue that make it difficult to put down for a minute. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent storyteller who has crafted a masterpiece that rivals his well-loved Three Muskateers series.In addition to being an excellent storyteller, Dumas is an astounding writer. The plot line is gripping in and of itself, but Dumas' expert control of the English language grips the reader with the words themselves, not just what they represent.It would be wise to read the abridged version of this novel, because for the average person the excruciating detail in the long version detracts from the story a little bit. To keep it more exciting and gripping, the shorter version covers the most important parts without many of the very miniscule details in the original.The original is also an excellent read, and gives much more insight into the characters' lives, but it would be reccomended to read it second to the abridged version, and only by the most patient Dumas fans."

The Count of Monte Cristo is mainly a story of revenge. The Romanticism in which the novel is characterized and the Napoleonic France for the setting, sets the mood for this nearly psychologically thrilling story that only a great French master like Dumas could create. Edmund Dantes, wrongly accussed of a crime he did not commit, taken to a prison of which there is no escape by his enemies, his only love taken by his best friend, spends years of suffering and harboring hatred in a rotting prison cell. But he also plans his revenge, how he methodically desires to bring upon the fateful end to his enemies and win back his love. He successfully manages to escape from prison and discovers a vast fortune. Assuming the identity of the Count of Monte Cristo, he extracts his revenge. What moral theme does Dumas really want to convey ? In the end, we discover how unfulfilled and how miserable our hero is, even when he has had the satisfaction of punishing his enemies. Dumas should be credited for such a marvelous work. He writes in the highest French Romantic fashion, and should be hailed with as much praise as Gustav Flaubert. The Three Musketeers, the immortal adventure story that made him famous, has been made into numerous films, and even The Count of Monte Cristo has had a terrific film version starring Will Chamberlain. A new release of the novel is set for January 25th of this year. Dumas may have died penniless, and he may not have been considered an excellent voice of the romantic age, but it is 2001 and we are still enthralled with the tales of intrigue, suspense, romance and adventure that this wonderful French writer conceived. Viva Dumas! Five stars for his terrific revenge story the Count of Monte Cristo"

The story is Edmond Dantes, happy and fortunate young sailor, about to become captain of his own ship, marry his beloved Mercedes, and live happily ever after. Then success is snatched from his hand and he is unjustly thrown into the monstrous prison of Chateau d'If, where he spends fourteen years vowing to avenge himself.He gets out eventually, in one of the most dazzling and vivid scenes ever written, and makes his fortune finding buried treasure on the tiny island of Monte Cristo. Henceforth he is known as the Count of Monte Cristo: Enigmatic, a little surreal, and ready to exact perfect reward for those who did him well -- and perfect justice for those who did him evil.But there are complications that even the mighty count couldn't have foreseen: the son of his ex-fiancee and his bitter enemy befriends him, the son of his dead benefactor is in love with the daughter of the man who sentenced him to life in prison to protect his career, and the question comes up: When is revenge right, how far do you go, and do humans even have the right?It's a fantastic story, a memorable and fast-paced story, and, unlike a few books I could mention, truly deserves its label of classic. For those who like action: This book has prison, escape, treasure, poison, love, cruelty, redemption, revenge, forgiveness, ambiguity, sadness, triumph, and hope. Don't be daunted by the page count. It's a true work of art.Has anyone got a copy of the Three Musketeers?Rating: Masterpiece"

Vivid characters riddle the book with personality and it's suspense and language kept me up 'til my alarm clock rang for work the next morning - I didn't want to leave the world that was made such a comfortable home for me, the world of The Count of Monte Cristo.Truly this book proves that it is not the destination, but rather the journey that makes all worth while.It is pure adventure, a hypnotic and tantalizing tale of romance and revenge and the transformation of a man.Don't settle for the movie, as the book is worth every second spent reading.

It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died.

This book allows you to take a look into the life of royalty and of peasants during the early eighteen hundreds. The action in this book took a while to start but when the action started it kept up throughout the novel. I saw the movie before I saw the book so I thought that the book would be the same as the movie. The book in fact is very different than the movie. There is fighting in the movie and the details of the story are different. This story filled with deception, but you know whom to trust. But Edmond does not seem to realize whom to trust. Edmond does horrible things to the people whom he has revenge for. Edmond only does this however to get back what he has lost and he still helps people along the way. Edmond plans out this revenge that he destroys the people he is out to get. He makes them into laughing stokes."

Within five minutes of reading it, I was hooked. The next 1,000 pages simply flew by and I literally could not put the book down. For someone who's never read it before, it's an enthralling tale of treachery, despair, hope, and ultimately a quest for vengeance. After finishing &quot;The Count&quot;, I immediately sought out every book by Dumas I could get my hands on (The Three Musketeers, Ten Years After, and The Man in the Iron Mask).

The Unabridged Oxford Edition is the best. The explanatory notes are a great bonus as they deepen the experience of reading this Masterpiece. The introduction gives us very interesting supplementary information that allows for a greater appreciation of the story as well as for Alexander Dumas himself. This is a book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime, and I highly recommend reading the actual book, not Kindle. This is a book that you will develop a relationship to and it becomes your friend. There's something very nostalgic and comforting about holding a real book in your hands. I may be very old fashioned, but sometimes books don't feel right when electronics are involved. I love the cover of this edition as well (revised edition 2008) . I feel that it captures the essence of Edmund Dantes: A young, beautiful man with sadness and revenge in his eyes. The painting (Leon Cogniet's self portrait) evokes an ability to penetrate the Soul of Dantes, the greatest protagonist of all time. It may sound a bit silly, but reading this book makes me pause. And when I pause, I find myself studying this image while contemplating life. Life as I experience it through this incredibly complex adventure called The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is epic!! As the back page states: 'A novel of enormous tension and excitement'. I buy this particular copy in bulk and gift it to anyone I meet who is even just slightly interested in reading it.

All the good things in Dantes' life are wrenched from his grasp in an instant, due to the betrayal of men he once considered friends. Dantes is unjustly thrown into prison. In jail, the kind, friendly Dantes the reader is introduced to is transformed into a merciless conspirator, bent on extracting revenge from those who betrayed him.Dantes comes upon a fortune that he would never have even dreamed of, and with its aid, is able to hide behind the mask of the Count of Monte Cristo, a mysterious, brooding man with a huge amount of power. Dantes slowly and subtly begins to ruin the lives of the men who ruined his own life fourteen years ago.Alexandre Dumas' tale is thrilling, full of excitement and surprising twists and turns. His writing style is hardly ever slow. In the middle, it seemed like he was abandoning the main story line, but by the end the author cleverly ties all the loose ends together to weave a fantastic story. This book is sure to please anyone who enjoys reading about love, betrayal, revenge, adventure, action, romance, and most importantly, self-discovery and change. Dumas shows the reader, through Dantes, how pain and anguish can change a person so extremely.I highly recommend this book. Dumas' writing is so good; I was caught up in the story of Dantes instantly. I felt horrible when he was thrown in jail, and triumphant when he finally extracts revenge from his enemies. Though, in the middle of the book, is seems a little slow, the author soon picks up the main plot line again and all the subplots make sense again. The characters are well-developed, and the story, though not quite plausible, is full of exciting and delightful surprising."

At first the reader may have to read, then re-read many of the sentences in an effort to garner the true meaning as, for most of us, this wordy text can be a little confusing and somewhat overwhelming. Not to far into the book, it becomes easier to handle and, in all honesty, it's a delight to read. Personally, I would enjoy being able to use words the way Dumas portrayed in his characters.Edmond Dantes is the main character who is falsely imprisoned due to a mixture of jealousy and self-preservation by others. He spends some 14 years in a dungeon where he is befriended by another inmate who schools Dantes and informs him of a fortune in buried treasure. Dantes escapes and sets out to garner revenge.

None, however, equal Edmond Dantes. He is the most inspirational character in literature. Left for dead in a horrid French prison, he rises up and becomes a man of incredible means. Once a worthy ship captain, he comes to master such arts as chemistry, medicine, swordplay, gunplay, language, and disguise. Once an honorable young man, he now seeks vengeance from those who wronged him. Edmond is a calculating man in his ventures. However, he is not cruel. When he exacted his revenge on the lawyer who wronged him, he realized that he had gone to far in allowing the death of the lawyers child. His thoughts were &quot; God is no longer with me. I have gone to far. We shall spare the last&quot; (meaning Danglars, another man who wronged him). Noone can equal him in his prowess. His mastery of the duel is truly scary. He became a distinguished noble in French society, by using his charm. However, he always had a plan, and that plan was payback to those who ruined his young life.

The characters, especially the Count, are fascinating, if not realistic. I'm no literary critic, but the mixture of reality and fantasy reminded me a bit of magical realism.

I have only read the abridged, but it was enough to judge by. While beautifully written and expressed with vivid detail, it was too dramatic to be given 5 stars. Dumas makes the mistake of making Dantes a god, and giving him infinite intellect. He is not a real-life character in the least! Therefore, it is hard to believe all the 'once in a blue moon' events that occur around and through Dantes.However, Dantes' revenge is so fantastic, that it is hard to discredit the book. Reverting from the classic 'kill-all' revenge, Dantes stealthily discredits all his oppressors, involving the reader with the plot. But Dantes himself knows perhaps too much, can do things that are not humanly possible... and so, I rate this book 4 stars."

The only reason that no one, excepting Mercedes, figures out who Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo, Sinbad the Sailor, Abbe Busoni and Lord Wilmore are is because of the way the Count represents himself and 'others.'I think the real question that The Count of Monte Cristo is asking us today is why we have forgotten the things that were so key to the way people lived back then. Maybe we have gained in science and math, but we have lost so much! Thinking of the forgotten things is the real painfulness of this book. This one is at the very top of my list.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""",0/5,2.0,1334275200,What An Unpleasant Experience!,"Several years ago I bought THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO at a Borders (yeah, Borders) store. Not possessing the knowledge that the unabridged novel is over a thousand pages long, I assumed I had the entire book in my collection. Having finally cleared my schedule so that I could fully concentrate on Alexandre Dumas's classic about vengeance gone wild, I was horrified by what I was reading. Halfway into the book I took the trouble to look at the title page, and then the inherent weaknesses of the book were quickly explained; I was reading the Borders Classics Abridged Edition. Suddenly all the plot inconsistencies, timeline malfunctions, gaping holes in the story--along with all the mundane, trite, and nauseating melodramatic dialogue--made perfect sense. The Borders Abridged is awful, and, although I doubt I will ever try to tackle the unabridged edition, in my opinion does Dumas's classic not one iota of justice.I do hope the original tale is not as myopically presented--with each major character engaging in a monotonous pity party--as the abridged edition I suffered through. Protagonist Edmond Dantes comes across as cruel and reprehensible; the characters that conspired to send an innocent man to prison are demonstrably shallow and superficial. Hosts of other characters such as Haydee, Madame Danglars, Madame de Villefort, Debray, ad nauseum, are never fully vetted or explained. The only benefit from enduring this particular abridged edition is my determination, upon the purchase of another classic, to make darned sure I'm buying the unabridged version. Books, especially good books, are meant to be enjoyed as they originally were written--not hacked to nonsensical pieces for the sake of brevity. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO deserves better.--D.

It was about a gang of pre-teens who are abused in a reform school, read Count of Monte Cristo in school and vow to take revenge on their persecutors, even if it takes years and years to put their plan into action. This led me to believe that Count of Monte Cristo glorified the concept of revenge. Dumas did so much more than that. He portrayed a life that was completely consumed by the need for revenge and in the end the true message was of regret, not revenge. For me that message transformed this book from an entertaining thriller to a powerful classic. As I have said in other reviews, I have young children and this will be a must read when they are teens. I can tell my children that I believe in turning the other cheek, but this classic illustrates why forgiveness should beat revenge on any given day."

My expectations were entirely inadequate. The Count of Monte Cristo is rather a tale of revenge through the artifice of intrigue and cold calculation. Dumas creates a broken man, betrayed by a trio of duplicitous schemers, and devotes the bulk of the book to the complex machinations employed in retaliation.The phrase ""intricately detailed"" does not begin to describe the plots and sub-plots which carry this classic forward. Like all novels of its period, the author relies on what the modern-day reader would consider implausible convenience. This doesn't detract from its worth. To create such a tightly-laced weave, some liberties must be granted. The reader gladly forgives Messr. Dumas.On par with The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, and the works of James Fenimore Cooper, The Count of Monte Cristo is wonderfully thick and magisterially constructed. Set primarily among the preening social elite of post-Napoleanic Paris, yet ranging from Rome to Normandy, it is a 5-star reading experience."

Dumas was a master storyteller and knew how to create a cast of tremendous characters. He put together everything you need in one marvelous story. The setting is perfect, and though a little too detailed for today's writing, it was necessary at the time when people didn't travel and see the world.Conflict permeates the book, and Dumas dishes out the suspense like a master, tossing a dash in just when needed.Every character has depth, lots of depth, and the plot is not only intricate, but devious. The mother of all revenge books. And who doesn't love a good taste of vengeance?Edmond Dantes ranks high on my list of greatest characters in literature, and Alexandre Dumas as one of the best writers."

Ross ""Bacchuskitty""",4/4,5.0,1281916800,A Wonderful Adventure - Reference Translation,"Let me say first that this is NOT the book I read when I was in school. For years I had a vague recollection of The Count of Monte Cristo as some required reading, a tale of a man wronged and his ensuing adventure as he attempted to take his revenge and right the wrongs done to him. As a child, I knew nothing of the foreign origins of some books and the process of translation to make them accessible to me nor of the concept of abridging a document from the original form as written to a presumably more digestible, shrunken version better suited to those with shorter spans of attention or time constraints.The story, to be painfully brief: This is the story of Edmund Dantes, a man of bright prospects and on the verge of wedding the beautiful Mercedes. Betrayed by envious friends, Edmund finds himself spirited away to a prison island. Despondent and having given up all hope of his release and of a reunion with the love of his life, he resigns himself. While in the depths of despair, he meets an eclectic and learned fellow inmate. They immediately bond and Edmund's newfound friend becomes as a father to him and proceeds to teach him all that he knows: languages, culture... and of a mind-boggling buried treasure. Edmund manages to escape the island prison years later and makes his way to the island of the buried treasure, not really expecting to find it. What he finds is treasure so vast as to make a king blush. Newly wealthy, learned, and free, Edmund assumes the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo and sets in motion the machinery of revenge...I returned to this book as an adult to satisfy my own curiosity and to add flesh to my memory of the adventures of Edmund Dantes that were admittedly skeletal. Because of my previous experience, I was expecting the same stilted, simple read I remembered, a children's book. Initially I was shocked, having done some research to lead me to this particular translation, to find over 1,200 pages of text. That rivals the intimidating girth of my copy of War and Peace. I took the plunge, though I also committed myself to dropping the project once it became apparent that I'd never make it to the end. I needn't have worried. To my amazement and pleasure, I found a tale of adventure of epic proportion replete with revenge, murder, love and loss, in the best tradition of operatic drama. For those of you who love to read and shy away from this because you think you've already read it or that it is only for children... trust me: you haven't, and it's not.This review is for the particular version translated by Robin Buss. This is an excellent and modern translation, executed with an academic's eye for accuracy but the flow and readability of a novelist. Anyone who has compared different translations of novels knows how vastly different the two readings can be. It is not just a matter of age, either, where modern readers can stumble over words or stylistic cues that one may consider archaic. It has more to do with the translator's understanding of the intent of the author, of the subtleties of style, of context, both historical and within the story itself. The Buss translation is, in my opinion, THE translation to read. The beauty of it is that the translation does not get in the way, it is invisible. It is the author Dumas one hears, not the translator Buss, and that is the brilliance of this translation. As a bonus, there are fully thirty pages of notes on the text at the back which I found illuminating and useful.But 1,200 pages, you say? Don't have time, you say? I was so thoroughly sucked into this tale of revenge and adventure I completely lost track of time. By the time I finished I felt only that it was far, far too short. I suppose it has to be so that, as a child, I was offered only the abridged version; I would never have put up with a book as long as this one. As an adult who loves to read and appreciate, however, I will be forever grateful to have been let back to this rich, amazing tale at full strength. I recall turning pages by the hundreds, fully engrossed; the lawn mowing would have to wait until next weekend...Make no mistake, while reading this unabridged version will evoke in you a child's excitement and sense of adventure, this is a book for adults to appreciate. Read it, enjoy it, get lost in it. Unequivocally recommended at five stars."

I read this book as part of a book club and probably never would have read it on my own--having read many of the books of Hugo and Dickens and other writers of that approximate era. I love both of these writers but find them both at times cumbersome and stilted and really wasn't in the mood for another. However, I could not put the Count of Monte Cristo down. This book seems freshly modern in writing style compared to these superb writers. From the beginning it is a page turner--almost Harry Potter like in its ability to have action, adventure and drama on almost every page. If you read the unabridged version you will find some allusions to morality and the wrongness of revenge which I enjoyed. But what makes the book great is the grandeur of the writing, the tightness of a wonderful plot, filled with subplots, the development of the characters, and the constant magic of combining romance and adventure. It is the ultimate romance book. If you watched the most recent version of the movie, you might be disappointed at the lack of sword fights, but there is never a lack of adventure and suspense. It might be 1400 pages long, but it never disappoints."

""Web Marketing All in One Desk R...",3/4,5.0,1218067200,A Tale as Rich as the Sandwich,"Perhaps the only work in popularity to rival Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers is The Count of Monte Cristo. As with many of Dumas' works, the story has huge cast of characters and several underlying plot lines dealing with political upheaval and scandals in France during that era. I found that the The Man in the Iron Mask had so many side political story lines that it made the novel confusing and hard to follow. And then I got bored. However, The Count, has just the right amount and ties together very well at the end, which does not subscribe to the generic formulaic predictable plot. In fact, I would deem it the ultimate revenge story.There have been 11 films and 4 television series that have attempted to tell the tale of the wronged Edmund Dantes and his search for his fiance Mercedes and his pursuit of the man that wronged him. The most recent film was in 2002 starring Jim Caviezel and while casted well, paled in comparison to the novel in many ways and the liberal creative license taken with the story almost offending. The latter half of the film no longer resembled the masterpiece of the novel. Yes, most films pale to their written counterparts, but this one in particular deserved a Golden Razzie.The novel has a huge story to go with the cast of characters, but is pretty basic in that a man is wrongly accused and seeks to right the wrongs, along the way, losing those that he cared about, mounting his need for revenge even further. Edmund calculates and plans out the most exquisite plans and is not completely heartless or merciless. In fact, his compassion and loyalty are overriding themes throughout the novel. I guess you could say the richness of the Monte Cristo sandwich rivals that of it's namesake!The Count of Monte Cristo is not a novel to be missed.And if you really need the short version, The Simpsons did a 10min summary in the episode ""Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times."""

BUT for those of you who like me have seen movies and animation ""loosely"" based on the book. Two elements in adaptations: the union of Edmond & Mercedes, and Edmond's transformation from cold-hearted avenger to human being again, are limited to the adaptations!!*SPOILER ALERT*The original story (English version anyway) is a lot more complicated. Edmond or Monte cristo, as the story progresses, is cold, cruel, and blind with revenge as he drives one enemy to the madhouse and the other to commit suicide, and yet another he allows to be beated to death. By the time he realizes he has gone too far and starts to feel remorse, the horrifying damage is done. Edmond never truly forgives the men who framed him or his betrothed (Mercedes) for not waiting for him. However, he does realize he can't play God and is not the hand of providence. He knows he must atone.As for Edmond and Mercedes, they DONOT reconcile and reunite, instead he hangs her out to dry and sails off with some Greek princess, Haydee, who is at least 20 years his junior in the last chapter of the book. Haydee who is a supporting character at best is so ineffectual and child-like, its actually annoying. It's hard to feel sympathy for her sad story while she acts pompous and dim witted. Her main purpose in the story is as a plot device (the revenge on Fernand), she is otherwise a shadow character whose affection towards the count is parasitic, she herself appears so indulgent and kind of a moocher. The count's choice of her as a mate killed the ending for me. Granted, the count is pathetic and all alone in the world at this point, and will take whatever he can get.The orginal story destroyed my cherished idea/memory of ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""

I am not a big reader of fiction and the story line of the book didnt inspire a lot of confidence. A story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned who comes back and avenges his enemies -- doesn't sound too interesting.Anyway, I just started reading a few pages just for the heck of it and found that I couldn't put the book down. This was story-telling at its best. It took me a couple of days to finish the book -- I really did nothing else during that period. The book was so well written -- and well translated.There are a whole bunch of characters in the story and their stories weave in and out of each other sustaining the pace of the novel. In some ways, this book seemed to be like a collection of novels (or novellas) that somehow got intertwined into a coherent large novel. Some of the things in the story might seem remarkable and hard to believe -- but that doesnt detract from the craftsmanship of Dumas which is quite unlike anything I have read thus far.There are a lot of abridged editions floating around -- however, after reading the original unabridged translation, I think its not possible to abridge the story without taking away significantly from its greatness."

During this imprisonment, Dante becomes highly educated under the tutelage of a fellow prisoner, Abbe Faria, and undergoes a spritual awaking; Dante henceforth wishes ""...to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.'""What follows is a daring escape, the discovery of great treasure and an elaborate plan, taking place over more than a decade, to bring all to justice. There are approximately 45 different characters (of which 5 or 6 are aliases of the lead), and a complex, interwoven relationship among them. (I suggest creating a 'character map' as you go along to keep things straight.) Additionally, and unlike 'modern' novels, there is purpose in each carefully crafted scene; each element serving to drive the plot forward to the unforgettable climax. This is undoubtly a classic that is as relevant and exciting today as it was 170 years ago. Highly recomended."

Dumas himself was one of the founders of the genre; every other such writer -- H. Rider Haggard, C.S. Forrester, Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy, John Grisham -- is deeply in his debt.The cold, brooding, vampiric Count (born Edmond Dantes; known also, among other aliases, as ""Sinbad the Sailor,"" Lord Wilmore, and a representative of the firm of Thomson and French) is the literary forebear of every dark hero from Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Pimpernel to Zorro, Batman, the Green Hornet, and Darkman. And the intricate plot provides everything any reader could want: adventure, intrigue, romance, and (of course) the elegant machinations of the Count himself as he exacts his terrible revenge on those who have wronged him -- thereby serving, or so he believes, as an agent of divine justice and retribution.

Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, the English translations have omitted everything in the novel that might offend the sensibilities of Victorian readers -- including, for example, all the sex and drugs.That's why I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this novel read Robin Buss's full-text translation. Unlike, say, Ayn Rand (whose cardboard hero ""John Galt"" also owes his few interesting aspects to Monsieur le Comte), Dumas was entirely capable of holding a reader's undivided attention for over a thousand pages; Buss's translation finally does his work justice, restoring all the bits omitted from the Bowdlerized versions.The heart of the plot, as most readers will already know, is that young sailor Edmond Dantes, just as his life starts to come together, is wrongfully imprisoned for fourteen years in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If as the victim of a monstrously evil plot to frame him as a Bonapartist. While in prison he makes the acquaintance of one Abbe Faria, who serves as his mentor and teaches him the ways of the world (science, philosophy, languages and literature, and so forth), and also makes him a gift of a fabulous treasure straight out of the _Thousand and One Nights_. How Dantes gets out of prison, and what he does after that -- well, that's the story, of course. So that's all I'm going to tell you.However, I'll also tell you that the 2002 screen adaptation doesn't even begin to do it justice. The plot is so far ""adapted"" as to be unrecognizable, except in its broad outlines and the names of (some of) the characters. Pretty much everything that makes Dumas's novel so darkly fascinating has been sucked out of it. It's not a bad movie on its own terms, but if you're expecting an adaptation of this novel, you'll be disappointed. And if you've already seen it, don't base your judgment of the novel on it."

Several of the parts are rather longer than the need be, the Rome section in particular drags tediously (it was originally meant to open the book, it was only after he had scetched out the plot that he decided to tell the story of Edmond Dantes incarceration and break-out instead of us meeting the enigmatic Count in the middle of the Roman Carnival and moving on to Paris shortly there after).As most people know the Count of Monte Cristo is the story of a wrongfully imprisoned man who breaks free, gets a massive fortune and then sets out to revenge himself on the people responsible. What most people don't know is that the prison section serves only as a small part of the story and that it is in the main taken up by the Count's prolonged revenge. What most people also don't know is the bits that are often left out of the movies and the abridgements yet so enliven the tale such as suicide, infanticide, lesbianism, transexualism, murder and drug taking.

Whereas &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; featured a quartet of swashbuckling heroes, &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; centers around one mysterious, seemingly omnipotent individual.The book opens in Marseilles, where the reader is introduced to the central characters as young men. A plot is laid and carried out against one of these men by his rival for the love of a woman. After the passage of 14 years, the lives of these characters slowly begin to converge once again as the victim of the conspiracy seeks his vengeance.The setting for his revenge, however, is a far different venue than the Mediterranean fishing community of Marseilles. His old enemies have become wealthy and powerful, and move in the highest circles of Paris society. The skeletons in their closets would now be the ruin of lofty reputations. Their families will become unknowing actors in the drama of vengeance that begins to unfold when the Count of Monte Cristo takes up residence in Paris.The victim of the conspiracy of hotheads in Marseilles was an unsophisticated provincial at the time. Upon his return, he is wealthy, subtle, and implacable. He embarks upon his quest for revenge with a well-planned, methodical campaign, marshalling resources that he has devoted years to organize. He uses a dozen or so people as his allies, some unknowingly, others willingly, but none are aware of his ultimate objectives. Yet, as complex and detailed as his plans are, he encounters complications that force him to choose how far to pursue his revenge.I was captivated by the dark and light contrasts of this story. The glitter and elegance and courtliness of French society of that day are set against the darkness of scandalous family secrets and destructive, coldblooded scheming. It's a combination that can't miss, particularly at the hand of a master writer like Dumas. This is a long book to plow through, but the further one gets, the more the threads of the plot come together to the final triumphs and defeats. As you reach the closing chapters, you may be reminded of a line from the movie &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; -- &quot;no man is rich enough to buy back his past.&quot;"

At some point a book gains such a critical mass of readers that reading the book is necessary to maintain your level of cultural literacy.Considering only the text, I felt it was very good, but not one of the greatest. I agree with all of the positives cited in the other reviews. Dumas is a master story teller, the tale is coherent and easily visualized. There are however, two drawbacks that ruined the book for me. Firstly, the story is so contrived that it completely destroys any suspension of disbelief. Secondly, the story is so predictable that you can see what's going to happen several hundred pages in advance. Other than these two annoyances, The Count of Monte Cristo is about perfect."
1990,B0007K33F2,"Monte Cristo,",,AIKSUSO0OE656,Fady Gharbawy,0/0,5.0,1200268800,Greatest plot. Just enticing.,"The words ""bestest"" and ""awesomest"" should be added to the next edition of Webster's since nothing else can describe Dumas's ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" When it comes to plot suspense and valuable moral lessons, Dumas has it all. Imbuing it with a rich and captive plot, Dumas enriches his masterpiece with themes of love, hate, vengeance, and forgiveness--all part of our quotidian lives.Although the original version stretches over 1200 pages, the abridged version with its 600 pages is just as enticing but more complex at few scenes where some characters appear suddenly.A background of the author's era is essential in understanding the setting and beginnings of ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" It was during this era that French royalties exiled Napoleon Bonaparte, the hailed French hero, to the Mediterranean island of Elba, where Edmond Dantes, the protagonist, finds him. It is the letter containing Napoleon's secret plans of retaliating against the French nobility that partially causes Dantes's imprisonment. This political reason, however, is not the main reason.Though mostly direct and clear, Dumas's style varies to a more philosophical one when discussing human nature, which he does often towards the end. Edmond Dantes, as mentioned above, is the young and well-off protagonist, ready to become the captain of his ship and get married. With a big heart and somewhat ignorant soul, Dantes falls into the farce those closest to him had set up. In the beginning chapters, the ready already sees themes of love, hatred, and jealousy.Returning after a long time under the name of Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes begins executing his plans of revenge against those who destroyed him and recompense those who helped him. What truly makes this book such a remarkable one is the beauty and perfection with which the Golden Rule (""Do unto others what you with done unto you"") is applied throughout the development of the plot.With abundant characters that differ in personality and beliefs, every reader is sure to find his/her own reflection taking part of the story's advancement.Overall, this book is worthwhile to read. I assure you that you will not be disappointed but you will enjoy every chapter of it. It is no wonder that it is hailed as ""one of the greatest classics."""

Unjustly placed there upon return to the port of Marseilles; made scapegoat for a Bonapartist action which he had no involvement with, Dantes is torn from his life as sailor, fiance, and son, and tossed into the darkness of solitary confinement, left to rot; untried, unexplained, and forgotten.Many years later, hope comes in the form of an ailing prisoner trying to tunnel his way out. He confides his greatest secret, the hiding place of an immense fortune, to Dantes before he dies. Seeing this as his only chance at freedom, Dantes assumes the place of the corpse, is removed from the prison for 'burial', and escapes.Thus begins his revenge. After collecting the very real wealth in the cavern on Monte Cristo, he assumes the title of Count, and exacts his vengeance on those who stole his life.The Count; benefactor, patron, and friend of the elite, insinuates himself into the lives of those who deprived him of all he loved, and authors their downfalls. All the while rewarding the good and just, he prepares punishment for those who are deserving.The book is entertaining from start to finish and was well worth the read. The Count's revenge is deserved, and well doled out, as he allows all to destroy themselves with their wrongdoing, simply supplying them the means. The ending is not so grand scale as to be Hollywood-esque in scope, but satisfying nonetheless. Dantes realizes that in following his path of revenge he has simply placed himself in another 'prison,' that of hatred, and he tempers his actions with deeds of generosity and gratitude, perhaps as a measure of atonement. But no matter what ills befall those who betrayed him, you constantly root for Dantes to emerge triumphant.The more classic literature I read, such as Count of Monte Cristo, the easier it is to see why good literature survives the test of time."

Riveting, it is the story of a young man, Edmond Dantes, who is falsely accused of treason by three selfish villains who each desire something different from Dantes; The story is set in 19th Century France. Dantes is a young, strikingly handsome, 20-year old newly-apppointed ship captain with his whole life ahead of him. He is about to marry the woman of his dreams, a young, vivacious, awesomely beautiful Catalan girl from France named Mercedes. For reasons unbeknownst to him he is betrayed by three cruel, evil men, accused of treason, and secretly heralded away to the foreboding Chateau de If prison where he serves almost 14 years in solitary confinement. With the help of a wise old abbe, he successfully institutes an escape plan; After a daring, nerve frazzling escape, he sets about to claim a vast, hidden, enormous fortune that is hidden at the Isle of Monte Cristo. After locating riches beyond imagination, Edmond dons the title the Count of Monte Cristo, he is a man of immense wealth, stature, class, and a man of society. But with all the riches and fame bestowed upon the Count, he must complete some unfinished business. That is, he must enact revenge upon the evil men who robbed him of his youth, the love and life of his father, the loss of his betrothed, and his prominence as a ship captain. You will find yourself seated at the edge of your seat, perhaps stopping only to take care of life's necessities because when Monsieur Le Comte de Monte Cristo enacts his revenge, he takes no prisoners. The Count of Monte Cristo captures our very essence as we watch his plan unfold before our very eyes. He carefully and fastidiously orchestrates his plan of revenge to punish the men who acted so predictably and maliciously against him. This book gets five thumbs up because it demonstrates vulnerable life experiences that happen to many of us. That is, to say it is a story about true human courage, emotion, greed, jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. And, the count makes the punishment fit the crime for each man. This book is not for the squeamish or immature at heart. One of the best novels of all time."

It is a simple explanation of human nature. All of these are descriptions of a novel I recently read by the name, ""Of Mice and Men"" by a well-known author John Steinbeck. I would rate this book 8 on a scale of 10 because I learned so much about the way we treat others and their reactions, told through a man who has had much experience with the subject. Lennie, a big dumb, jock, was born slow, mentaly incapable of reacting to daily life. After George, a caring yet riggid man befriends him early in child hood, the two become traveling partners and best buddies. George becomes weary of Lennie's childish ways and misachievous antics, which continually causes the pair trouble and forces them to skip around the country.""That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a quarter mile. We're gonna go in an' see the boss. Now, look-- I'll give him the work tickets, but you ain't gonna say a word. You jus' stand there and son't say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy ... you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk we're set. Ya got that?""This story is special because all aspects of diction, from all characters are described in simple English. The story had no useless vocabulary or pointless explaining, just a plain dexcription of the people. The story also uses vivid imagery when George tells Lennie about how they were going to own a ranch and Lennie can raise rabbits. Steinbeck reveals the simle truth about racism, dgradation, and jelousy. People in the book are struggling to overcome an obstacle that holds them back. At their final stop, they meet all types of people, which teach them about diversity and how to deal with it. The story's resolution reveals how humans deal with the sorrow of our society. The outcome may shock us, yet it seems just in it's own irony. I sincerely suggest this book to those looking to explore humanity and to those who would like to know what friendship and loyalty is and if you liked ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" or ""The Catcher in the Rye"", you will like this book because I, Jamil Faruque a student of Falls Church HS, have read both of these books which shows similarities with ""Of Mice and Men"""

I tend to be a very emotive reader, and more often than not will respond passionately to what I read. However, Steinbeck has left me feeling completely neutral; I was not particularly invested in the characters or events of the book, and found the conclusion neither satisfying nor disappointing. In the end I'm willing to consider this neutrality a positive result of the trial - I didn't hate the book, so I'm more open to reading something along the lives of Travels with Charlie, but I also didn't love it, so I doubt I'll be tackling The Grapes of Wrath anytime soon."

It started with the discussion of Candy's aged dog. The book gave the impression that the dog's age made him no good to even himself, the ""quality of life"" argument that has been advanced to support euthanizing the elderly, weak and infirm.After discussing Candy's dog, the argument proceded to Candy himself, where he longs to be euthanized when he can no longer work.Finally, we come to George's murder of the retarded Lennie, which is completely justified by Slim, the voice of the one sympathetic character in the book. I believe that George was looking for an opportunity to divest himself of Lennie, and that opportunity presented itself when Lennie killed Curley's wife. It was also mentioned that if Lennie was institutionalized, it would be worse than death. I realized there are conflicting opinions about the moral nature of George, but I don't believe he was a good character.As I was writing this review, I recalled Proverbs 31:8-9 ""Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."" Of Mice And Men describes a world where the advocates for euthanizing the weak and infirm prevail."

John Steinbeck who is the author of this novel has wrote many novels like the ""Of mice and men"", If you like any other novel from his collection; I will definitely recommend you this novel. If You are a men and you have a friendship with another men who is physical disable, I will truly recommend you this novel.D. Maturana"

They go around from job to job trying to build up a stake. One of the main characters is George. George is a small, strong man, with a keen eye, and a stolid expression. The other main character is Lennie. Lennie is a tall clumsy man, but at the same time he is strong as an ox. He has a sort of childish behavior and no sense of self-control. Everywhere they went, Lennie seemed to get into trouble with someone. It seemed that Lennie's lack of self-control would force both Lennie and George to quit their jobs early and try to find work elsewhere.I think that if I had to relate myself to one of the characters it would have to George. I think George and I have a lot in common, we both are always trying to solve other people's problems instead of our own. I usually do things that other people want first and what I want to do second. I also think the same way George does. We both have a dream of one day owning land and not having to pay rent on it. I too would one day like to like to not have to work for some one else. To be able to step outside and look as far as I could see and know that it is all mine.I really enjoyed the book. I think that the message of being loyal to your friends is a solid one that will never fade away. I enjoyed just being able to lay back and read about what trouble Lennie was going to get into next. My favorite part was the big fight between Lennie and Curley. I think that that fight had a lot of action and really made the book interesting to read, but at the same time kept it within reason so I wasn't disgusted by it. I really don't think there is any part that I didn't like in the book. I don't think that I would change any part of it if I had the chance to. The book was written so well that changing any part of it would alter the whole story.I would recommend this book to students in high school. It has some bad language and a little bit of adult content, but I think that students at that age can fully understand the story and really appreciate its message. I think that anybody with a small sense of humor and a good sense of adventure would really enjoy this book."

So powerful and affecting, it is a crime that some schools keep the book from teenagers who would undoubtedly find the story hugely important and compelling.

As a story it could have been much more elaborated but, to my dissapointment it was not. Reading the first chapter I was mysled to believe that I was going to find a good and interesting book due to the excellent descriptions. Instead, i found that he used the same style of description during the entire book making it repetitive and boring. Secondly, the only scenes of the book that were, in my opinion, worthwhile ended up being violent &quot;He slashed at Lennie with his left&quot;, &quot;Blood run down Lennies face&quot;. Finally, the entire ending of the book was my mayor disappointment as, it ends in a way that leaves a great deal of issues unconcluded, such as George's future. I think that the ending is very poor and leaves much to be desired. In conclusion, I believe the story did not live up to standard and I would not recommend it as it gives us a fake idea of what the book will be but, tears it apart as you go deeper into the story."

The novel was banned and challenged in many schools throughout the country because of explicit language and profanity. After finishing the book myself, I strongly disagree. The language used in Of Mice and Men is nothing new, and most definitely not something that teenagers have not already heard before. One of the characters, Crooks, who happens to be an African American, is quite often referred to in the novel as inferior and is treated much differently than the other characters in the novel. That is perhaps another reason why people may have challenged the novel. Personally, I feel that Of Mice and Men positively contributes to the literary world because of its status. Many critics feel that it is a classic and I feel it should be treated as such. The idea of companionship is demonstrated throughout the book, and I feel that is a positive force. As shown in the novel, everyone needs someone to talk to, one cannot go throughout life without friends to confide in and have fun with. Overall, Of Mice and Men is a classic novel that everyone should read."

That's how they got thrown out of a few of there jobs, and is the basis of the book.There is some foul language in the book, but regular working folk don't really mind eachother's bad language, and the bad language brings you farther into the book, like you were actually working on the farm.

It was an unexpected story and Steinbeck works well in surprising the human mind. I ive it a four for &quot;shockingly catching &amp; daring.&quot;The characters Steinbeck created all had diffrent personalities. When the men shot Cany's dog, all they cared about was getting sleep. Candy, on the other hand, was very sad. I thought in the olden days, men don't get sad, I thought they were confident, showed off teir strength and angry. Having Candy in the story turns my point of view on the olden days.The message I think Steinbeck is trying to send out to us is that the world is not what you think it is. There is always the unexpected to keep the mind still in learning. As an author, I think Steinbeck is trying to say that you can write whatever comes to mind because your story can still be heard."

The problem however, is that George and Lennie do not have nearly enough money to pay for their own farm nonetheless pay for a decent living. George is a small dark man who is pretty smart, and his counterpart Lennie is a little different. Lennie has a slight mental disability because he nearly drowned in a river that he and George swam in a long time before the novel started. Because George felt that he did not to enough to save Lennie, he vowed to take care of Lennie for the rest of his life.The next day, Lennie and George apply for a job at a local farm. They get a job and are allowed to live in a bunker house on the farm. In the house, they meet Candy, who is a another ""hand' around the farm, and Curley, who is the boss' mean-spirited son. Lennie and George work on the farm for the next week or so, when Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans for the farm they are going to buy. Candy vows to not tell anyone about the plans and says he will donate his life savings if he is allowed to live on the land. From that point on, whenever someone threatens Lennie or tries to make fun of him because of his disabilities, (example is Curley when he is jealous that his wife is hitting on everyone) Candy is there to back Lennie.During one of the following evenings, Lennie and Curley's wife get into a discussion about how they love to touch things that are soft. Curley's wife allows Lennie to feel her hair, and after a couple of minutes Lennie is yanking at Curley's wife's hair and ends up breaking her neck. Previously before this incident, Lennie had killed his baby puppy that had been given to him as a present. The next morning, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head as an act of mercy, to relieve him of a life, that he obviously never wanted to live.I thought that there were a couple of aspects in this novel that could have made it a banned book. An aspect may have been, who and who isn't allowed to work legally in the United States. I thought in the past, there may have been a law that said that no person with mental disabilities would be allowed to work manual labor. Because of this law, I thought they may ban this book because it is a prime example of how a retarded person got away with working on a farm and how the novel may show examples for other mentally-challenged people in the world to find jobs. Because this book, I thought promoted illegal policies, it would be banned. Also in a moral standpoint, I think this book may have been banned to relieve the public about a story of a retarded person who's life turned out so badly for him. I think this book may have disturbed many people in the past, therefore, the book was banned so when people saw mentally-challenged people, they would not relate the person to the story of Lennie in Of Mice and Men.I think this book positively aspects the literary world and its' themes should be shared by everyone that can read a book. I have many reasons why I believe this. First of all, I really liked how Of Mice and Men portrays the value of human existence. At one point in the book, we notice how Lennie has the need of a friend, yet he will cling to a stranger, such as Curley's wife, for self-comfort. In scenarios such as this one, we can see that tyranny does not come from those who are rich and powerful, and I believe that this is a very powerful concept to have the knowledge of because oppression does not come from ""the hands of the heavens,"" which is something everyone needs to know.Another aspect of this book that positively influences the outside world is how there is no possibility of everything happening perfectly, or ""The American Dream."" There are many examples of this throughout the book. For example, Curley's wife wishes to one day be a movie star, Crooks wishes to be the hardest worker on Lennie and George's farm, and Candy wishes that he will have a friend, (George) own a large piece of land. Obviously, none of these wishes came true. The moral to this is, what makes dreams is the desire to follow their own freedoms, and dreams, as shown by Of Mice and men, will never occur. And that is something that every American needs to know, is that dreams are meant to be dreams, and the sooner you know that, the better it is; which is why this book is a positive influence to the outside world.I would recommend this book to all advanced readers because it not only provides an interesting setting, climax, and plot, it provides a great understanding of the world, and what meanings of life the world has to offer. If you would like to have a story told to you that tells you the journeys of two young men who are looking for answers to life, but get them in symbolic form, read this novel, because you look at things a whole lot differently, once you look at life from a different standpoint."

It took place in the early 20th century. This story starts off with two characters near a stream. There names are Lennie and George. Lennie is slightly retarded and George is his long time care taker slash best friend. These two friends have a dream of owning there own farm one day. But first they had to make money, so they left on a small journey to find a job. They had a couple of jobs but Lennie couldn't control himself during the jobs so they got fired. They finally found a job at a farm. Lennie got into a fight. But they got to keep their jobs. Lennie messed up again, and accidentally killed Curley's Wife. Lennie ran back to the stream. The other farmers gathered and went to kill Lennie. George got a gun and killed Lennie before the farmers did. But Lennie was happy when he died because he was thinking of their dream farm.For the most part of this book I like it. It was a good story. I liked the conflicts. I felt bad for Lennie, because he's really a genital giant and it's not his fault that he freaks out when people scream. He also couldn't control himself and I felt bad for him because of that. Some thing I didn't like about this book was it said Jesus Christ a lot and that offends me. But other than that the book was easy to read and it was short...that's the way I like it. I liked the tone that the book was written in, old country slang. I like how the author wrote. I do recommend this book if you ever want to read a short and easy book. And overall it was a good book."

Most of the setting takes place at a small ranch with many more characters, and in the woods. I thought this story was very appealing when it came to the settings.Although the story was very exciting and fun, there were a few sad and suprizing parts which you will love if you read it. My opinion on the book was that the beginning was kind of boring, but got better as you went along. Some of the language in the book is used from before I was born and there was cussing in it too.

George is the one that has been keeping Lennie in line his entire life. However as the book continues the reader begins to realize that George really does care for Lennie and it he takes care of him out of love. The pair get a job working on a farm with other tenants. The obvious leader of the group is Slim, who starts a friendship with George at the very start. The reader is then introduced to Curley, who's father owns the farm, one immediately recognizes that Curley and his flirtatious wife are trouble. George and Lennie have plans to save enough money to buy a farm and live off the land. Another worker on the farm overhears them talking and asks if he can trade his life savings for a chance to stay with them on the farm. This shows how everyone else is envious of their rare friendship. The lives of the workers then spiral out of control when Lennie accidentally kills Curleys wife. Lennie immediately runs away but Curley knows who has killed her and they chase after him. George goes to the spot they picked as a place they are to go if they get separated.

George is a small man who is committed to taking care of Lennie, a large, strong, mentally disabled man, after his Aunt Clara's death. George always complains about how his life would be easier if he didn't have to take care of Lennie, but truly cares for him and tells him of their plans to have a farm of their own when they get enough money. Lennie loves the story of their future farm and always asks George to tell him about how someday he will get to take care of the rabbits. Lennie loves the soft touch of animals' hair which later gets him into trouble with the wife of a man who works on the farm of their new job.Lennie always seemed to be the outcast in the novel, even by George who told him not to speak when going for their new job, for fear that Lennie would not be allowed to work, or be seen as ""dumb."" Published in 1937, Of Mice and Men does not show signs of inclusion for those who are mentally disabled, nor any understanding of those who have disabilities. However, even though this novel does not show good examples of inclusion or understanding, it can still teach its readers positively about individuals with disabilities.Although this is a short novel, John Steinbeck allows this book to pull at its readers' hearts as well as teach lessons of life and love through the relationship of George and Lennie. Of Mice and Men would be a perfect book to teach at a high school level even though it is a seemingly easy read. There are themes throughout the book that would help students understand isolation, friendship, and strengths versus weaknesses. Even if there are no students with disabilities in the classroom or the school, students can learn from this novel the importance of inclusion even outside of the classroom. A class can even learn from this story about alienating students who don't have disabilities but still feel that they do not ""fit in."" I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read, no matter what age. I think that it teaches its readers a lot about life, no matter who comes into our lives and no matter how different they may be."

George is short and takes care of his best friend Lennie who is mentally retarded. Lennie is a tall man and is very strong. In this book there is a lot of violence. For example, Lennie and the boss's son Curley get into a fight because Curley was looking for his tart of a wife and Lennie was smiling at the thought of owning a farm of his own. Also, there is violence when Lennie and Curley's wife are in the barn together. He was feeling her hair and she started to scream and Lennie ended up breaking her neck and killing her. Another theme is dreams. This is represented by Lennie and George's wish of one day owning their own farm and living off "" the fat of the land"".

Steinbeckdoes a good job of writing this book as he describes people as if they were living their lives at the same level of existence as animals. But, unline the animals, these characters do have their dignity and face life without flinching. They have ideals that separate them from animals and they dream of their promised land, but it's too far away. Indeed, the theme in this book is companionship. The friendship between George & Lennie is close in that George takes it up for his feeble-minded friend and protects him above all, even his own interests. There is a deep sacred bond between these two as if they were brothers. There was great humor in the book as well as its equal share of sadness. I rate this book with 5 stars for it was adventurous, humorous, sad, and then the moral outcome in the end. I RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO'S LOOKING FOR A GREAT BOOK!"

The book starts off with a discription of a place that is by a lake and is surrounded with bushes. As I continued to read I began to like the characters. One being smart and the other being incredibly stupid. As the story goes on many events happen that make you continue to read. John Steinbeck keeps you intersested throughout the entire story.

Wayne Dworsky,1/2,5.0,1238976000,Friends to the End,"The title comes from the fact that one of the two main characters, Lennie, is a little retarded, but is still a kind man who only wishes for goodness. The other character, George, has more sense and knows his goals. He has dreams of buying a piece of land and settling down. He makes a continuous effort to keep Lennie's erratic behavior in check and keep him out of trouble. However, in one incident, he held a mouse in his hand so tightly that he killed it, only desiring to caress it, but not knowing his own strength. He also has a rather awkward moment with a young farm girl in one of their migrant worker jobs, who terrifies him by screaming in Lennie's presence, driving the man to shake her until her life is gone.George always tries to rescue Lennie when he finds trouble, although he eventually realizes that he cannot watch him forever. Realizing that the girl's death is just too much to handle, he relinquishes his dreams of a ranch and a life for the two of them in order to find a more direct solution to Lennie's problems.This is a story of lessons in life that force you to reconsider what you invest in your friends. Of Mice and Men is a story of friendship, of devotion, disappointment and realization. John Steinbeck tries to show how flimsy our friendships can become even if they started off with the best of intentions and how loyal we must be to keep them intact. Yet, he filters out the hardships we endure just to survive and maintain a certain distance from those whose behavior effects us in detrimental ways. Again, Steinbeck is a genius, perfecting his storytelling by delving into the minds of these two men to see at what cost they remain devoted and loyal. I think Steinbeck has captured the spirit of hopes, dreams and wishes in a truly American episode of our great West."

While George looks out for the two, Lenny's innocent curiosity and brute strength prevents them from settling in one place or realizing their dream of owning their own farm. It is the type of heart warming story only Steinbeck can write and the realistic description and charged emotion throughout is unbeatable. This is one of my favorite Steinbeck stories because it can be enjoyed with a quick, cursory reading, but there are several other levels to explore within the novella if you choose to spend the time. It is a very short story--perfect for a junior high book report or a relaxing afternoon on the couch. I highly recommend this book."

Cruz ""AC""",0/0,4.0,1244332800,Book Review -- Of Mice and Men,"In the land of opportunity, everyone strives to achieve the ultimate goal: to live the American dream. Of Mice and Men's protagonists George Milton and Lennie Small are no different. John Steinbeck gives his readers the reality of the road to the American dream.George and Lennie dream of owning their own farm and being their own bosses, but they need to work for the money to buy land first. While working on a ranch, they encounter troubles with the boss' son, Curley, a hot-headed and aggressive man. These troubles climax with Lennie's accident and merciful end.One of the greatest elements of Steinbeck's novel is his character Lennie Small. Slightly mentally disabled, Lennie is a large but kind-hearted man with the mannerisms of a child. His unshakable, child-like faith in one day owning a farm is the drive of his and George's hard-work. Personally, he is one of the only characters who can provoke emotion from the reader, whether it is pity from Lennie being scolded by George and bullied by Curley, or utter sorrow from the final events of the novel.Steinbeck accomplishes to tell the ""other story"" of pursuing the American dream. Unlike many stories where there are happy endings, Of Mice and Men incorporates some harsh realities of making it big in the land of opportunity. The obstacles that George and Lennie face on the ranch and the heartbreaking ending definitely illustrate such realities.Despite the novel's ending, Of Mice and Men is a great book to read. I would personally recommend readers of high school age or above to read this great tale of two men and their struggles to success."

In the book Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck talks about the friendship between two migrant workers, George and Lennie. George is a small, wiry man that cared a lot about Lennie. He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind. Lennie&iexcl;s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.Both George and Lennie shared a common dream. Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches. To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream. The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.This is a great novel to read. It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest. It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene. The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it. The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess. Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life. I strongly recommend this story because it brings laugher, excitement, and tears, and it is a classic you don't want to miss."

It was written by John Steinbeck. The main conflict of this book was for these two men George and Lennie to make their dream of farming their own farm and where they could raise rabbits come true. They would travel from farm to farm and do work on different farms to make their living.In this book there were many things I liked and a few things I didn't like. The book was very exciting to read. It was so exciting because I was always wondering what was going to happen next and I didn't want to put the book down. I really felt like I was actually in the book. I felt this way because Steinbeck described everything so well, and I could picture every scene that happened. The main conflict interested me a lot. It interested me because there were many obstacles that Lennie and George had to face throughout the book and I just wanted to see if they could make their dream come true. I thought that the characters felt very real. They seemed real because Steinbeck gave the right amount of descriptions about each of them. The ending was very satisfying. It was a bit sad and I think it could have been better but if it ended differently the book wouldn't have been as good.The author John Steinbeck's writing style is unusual. The author's voice is a narrative style and it's written in the way the characters actually spoke. The characters talk like poor, uneducated people. The author uses vocabulary in an interesting way. He uses poor grammar and slang words to speak like the characters. The author uses a lot of dialog in this book. The two main characters speak to each other a lot. I think that the author is a very good writer because I could actually hear the voice of the characters. He describes things but he doesn't go overboard to make it boring.Compared to other books that I have read I would rate this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because it was a very good book and held my attention but there were a few parts he could have changed, like the ending. I recommend this book to any guy or girl. It is a very fast and good read.Overall this was one of the best books I have ever read. I would put this book in my top twenty favorite books. I've read another book by Steinbeck called The Pearl that I didn't really enjoy. I hope other books by Steinbeck are this god. Some other things that happened in this book was that Lennie wasn't very educated and George would always have to look out for him. Lennie loved to pet soft things. He would catch a mouse put it in his pocket and pet the mouse and squeeze it so hard that the mouse accidentally died. This would upset George a lot."

It really showed true friendship between the main characters George and Lennie. Even thought they were different in many aspects. George being the ""normal"" one... as for Lennie being mentally handicapped. Lennie even thought being mentally handicaped obeyed George and had great respect for him. And even thought as George had short temper he still managed to control himself and see that Lennie really needs him. As for the case of when Lennie killed the girl, George helped him run away and end his suffering by shooting him behind the head. But George new Lennie was a great guy, not to be a killer. As he, George, said to Lennie on his last moments ""think about the rabbits""... so we now know Lennie died in peace, thinking about his farm full of rabbits.I really recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read about a great friendship. Even though these guys were poor and low classed and had nothing to live for, they still had hope. They still had dreams of one day having/owning a farm of their own.

Some of his statements don't fit to his behavior and the other way around. In my view the ending is not chosen very well.

2075,0140860096,Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks),,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,Andrew Ellington,2/2,5.0,1194998400,"Tale of depression, loneliness and pure desperation, a tragedy that rings true even today...","It took me a measly three hours to read John Steinbeck's classic tragedy `Of Mice and Men', a novel that, while written in 1937, still holds so true today. Steinbeck's accounting of sheer loneliness and desperation is so brilliantly captured that the reader is brought to tears (for me in a literal sense) to realize that this is all these people had to live for, a pipe dream that refused to die. The story focuses mainly on George Milton and Lennie Small, but as you read you'll notice that a few supporting characters play a big role in the heartbreak that this novel conveys.George is a small framed man, lean and dwarfed in comparison to his companion Lennie, the tall large strong man, but what Lennie has in strength and size he lacks in smarts. He is, for lack of another word, mentally retarded. But Lennie does possess a simple soul and a heart of gold, which alone makes this tale all the more tragic. George, in fulfillment of a promise he made to Lennie's Aunt Clare, takes care of Lennie, taking him with him to work in the fields bucking wheat and the like. When they make it to their next job they find that they aren't the only ones trying to find a better lot in life.First they meet Candy, an older man who's been injured on the job and thus kept around for sympathy's sake. He sweeps the living areas and lives his life one miserable day at a time. He's slipping into uselessness and the very thought of amounting to nothing digs deeper and deeper into his soul. Crooks is the negro stable hand, an outcast from the others not only because of his skin color but also because of his disability, being crippled due to a horse accident (he was kicked in the back) and thus he spends most of his time alone in his room. They also meet the boss's son Curly, a jerk of a man who is so insecure about his size and his marriage that he's willing to throw it down with anyone he sees, and he sets the blunt of his rage on poor Lennie because of his size and his demeanor.To me the most interesting and even heartbreaking character is that of Curly's wife. Ostracized by the working men because of her husbands temper and disregarded by her own husband because of his carelessness and blatant jealousy she's left all alone with no one to talk to and no real place to call home. She's regarded by the men as a tart, a floozy who wants all the wrong kinds of attention but in all actuality she just wants any kind of attention she can get for any kind is better than no kind. After the tragic circumstances involving Lennie and Curly's wife the author makes a statement that to me sums up this poor woman when he says that ""all the meanness and the planning's and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face."" She was alone and desperate just like everyone else.The one thing that kept these stock of characters going, Lennie in particular, was the prospect of getting out, of getting their own place where they could plant and cultivate and ""tend rabbits"" and be their own men. When this idea is shared between Candy and Crooks they too jump at the idea of getting away from it all and feeling whole again, feeling complete and being far away from the loneliness of it all. The worst kind of loneliness is the kind you feel even when you're around other people for its then that you know you're truly alone in every sense of the word.Most people are aware of the horrific ending, but in case you are not then I will say nothing further on the subject. Just know that this novel is one of the finest pieces of American Literature and is sure to bring tears to your eyes. While this is just barely over 100 pages it still magnificently captures every emotion and feeling that can possibly be provided here. The characters are brilliantly crafted and their innermost demons are bared all for us to see and to relate. I will never forget this masterpiece and will recommend this to anyone who enjoys good reading. It's a quick read, but it's not one to soon be forgotten."

It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occured. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley; George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book written by John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends.

Both were traveling in southern California looking for work. While traveling they would have quite an adventure. One of the major problems between the two is that Lennie is simple-minded and touching things, like women, and their clothes. Lennie had no control over what he did sometimes. He would do things like tell other people about George and his future plans about buying their own house. Of the two I liked George.George is very short-tempered. He would yell at Lennie and hit him to make him remember and understand things he would tell Lennie. When they were at the river in the beginning George was scolding Lennie about not drinking water that wasn't running and when in trouble to come back by the river and hide in the bushes. Lennie was no smart man, but he tried to listen to George. I remember I would sometimes yell at my little brother because he would do things he had been told not to, but did anyway, like going outside without asking for permission. My little brother wasn't dumb but just wouldn't listen sometimes. I would yell at him not to be mean, but for his own good. Just like George is to Lennie.After reading this book I thought it was good. Good because of how the author started and ended George and Lennie at the same place, which was unique. The two friends were in a forest with different types of animals and a river and at the end they came back because Lennie got into big trouble and went to go a hide. The most interesting part was when Curley and Lennie were fighting. At first, Lennie was getting beattened pretty badly and then all of a sudden Lennie let out his anger. Having a child-like mind Lennie was unaware of his powerful strength. The only part I didn't like of the book was of how Lennie talks about rabbits too many times. That is what I would change about the book if I were the author.Since I like the book I would like others to read it as well. This kind of a book applies to all. It can also teach kids that they can be friends with anyone no matter what kind of a person they are."

John Steinbeck does such a wonderful job of describing the setting that you feel like you're on that same ranch in Salinas California during The Great Depression. The two men Lennie and Gorge are very different. George is small but very smart and quick while Lennie is huge very slow and dose not even know his own strength.The reason there are struggles is because every time they work Lennie always gets them in trouble in fact the reason they come to the ranch because they where run out of Weed. When Lennie and George get to the ranch they met the boss, Slim, Candy, Curly, and Crooks. Now Curly hates big people and has a wife that always is looking for him and the other half the time he's looking for her. Slim is like a hero of the ranch he is like the leader of the group. Crooks and Candy are two people you would have to feel sorry for. Crooks is the black stable buck that every time the boss is mad he takes it out on Crooks. Candy has an old dog that smells horrible and ends up killing him.This book is very good and I would only recommend this book to mature teenagers and up. The reason is because of the use of cussing and the N word. A great book no matter the slurs."

And from those themes, it helped explain certain attributes about different characters and the kind of society Lennie and George entered.

I define ""Hamlet Syndrome work"" as a work of literature that has been analyzed, dissected, and discussed so thoroughly that it's hard to say anything new or original about it. Steinbeck's enduring novella ""Of Mice and Men"" (hereafter OM&M;) certainly qualifies. OM&M; has permeated life and society's consciousness, at least American life and consciousness, probably because it unpretentiously depicts the main existential question of life: Is it worth living? Should we bother living? At first glance, OM&M;, from its title onward, seems to suggest NO.We have the classic split personality ""brains and brawn"" duo in George and Lennie. Despite their respective qualities, they could be considered life's hopeless losers. They are impoverished migrant workers and even fugitives because of an assault the mentally handicapped Lennie inadvertently committed upon a woman. Despite his vast strength, Lennie is a high-maintenance, perpetual man-baby who needs almost constant supervision. George profanely complains about the burden Lennie poses. Like just about all the other characters in OM&M;, they feel isolated and desperate, or at least they would if they didn't have each other. Nevertheless, defying the odds, George manages to wrangle himself and Lennie farm worker jobs.Things seems to settle down well. George and Lennie have saved money from previous jobs. The grizzled, dejected old custodian Candy has some money. Perhaps together they can buy a slice of earthly paradise: a rabbit farm where Lennie can live safe and secure and pet his animal friends. But the boss's ostracized, belligerent son Curley and his bored, ignored flirtatious wife eventually turn out to be serpents lying in the way. Lennie, again unintentionally, cripples one and kills the other. Earthly paradise goes up in smoke, but, some may argue, George mercifully gives Lennie a way to an otherworldly paradise.OM&M; portrays the apparently dead-end, humdrum, lonesome, hopeless rural world of Depression-era America. But like some great works of literature, it finds hope where there is no hope to be found. Despite their hard-luck lives, George and Lennie together function as an effective unit. They nurture a dream and keep going because of it. Candy helps bring their dream tantalizingly close. Slim, the manager, sympathizes with the duo and does what he can to protect them. George's mercy killing of Lennie after his manslaughter may be the kindest thing he ever did for Lennie. He keeps the dream alive for Lennie even as he shoots him in the back of the head. Slim arranges to have George's homicide appear to be self-defense and even be a shoulder to lean on as George glumly contemplates his ""freedom"" from Lennie.OM&M; seems to show life as an inevitable tragedy. However, it shows subtle suggestions that it need not have happened. Mainly, if George had supervised Lenny a bit more carefully, or had other characters like Crooks the shunned but dignified African-American stablehand (with whom Lenny had struck up a grudging friendship) watch out for him a little more, things may have turned out differently. OM&M;, I think, implies that life could be better and worth living if we WERE a little nicer to each other, cared a little more for each other, helped each other a little more. This solicitude, coupled with our capacity for hope in even the bleakest situations, is the key to bliss. Therefore, if God sees our hopes, our plans, our resolve, maybe He really isn't laughing. Maybe He is actually rooting for us."

Lennie is gigantic, like a huge gorilla, but has the mind of a kid. While Lennie, is rather short, and 'dark of face', seemingly 'sculpted precisely.' The 2 may seem to make a very unlikely, and dysfunctional pair, but in fact, they are reasonably good friends, but at times, argue a lot. Maybe at the fact of Lennie being a bit retarded, for when he was only a young kid, he got his head banged real hard on something.But either way, they cling to each other, in the ugly face of alienation and loneliness. They get work when they can, for they have a grand plan. To own a few acres of their own land. The whole package. Have their own log cabin, a vegetable field, a cage for the rabbits, for Lennies loves those rabbits, generally their own land they can roam freely upon without hesitation or reluctance or fear.But when they start working around Salinas, for the boss of the son of a guy named 'Curley' whos only bent on giving George and Lennie, especially Lennie, a hard time, their dream, now really appearing to be merely a dream, begins crumbling before their eyes. It is within their posession; their grasp of harnessing and achieving. But when it is all said and done, not even George can prevent Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things he firmly taught him to follow, nor the seductive grace of a beautiful woman--Curley's wife.This was my first John Steinbeck book that I have read and finished, and for deciding to pick the book up and read it in the first place, I am very glad for that. After finishing it, I was granted with a heightened sense of admiration and respect toward the author, and I plan to read many more of his books.

He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind. Lennie&iexcl;s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.Both George and Lennie shared a common dream. Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches. To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream. The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.This is a great novel to read. It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest. It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene. The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it. The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess. Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life. I strongly recommend this story because it brings laugher, excitement, and tears, and it is a classic you don't want to miss."

The story is based on two men and their struggle in life. One man, George, small in nature, looking over his large friend Lennie. This is a definite must read for anyone. This story is very popular and is frequently used as a beginner's read by many high schools across the nation.George and Lennie first set out to find new jobs after being forced to flee from their current jobs. At first you are not told why they were fleeing but you knew from the dialect that something bad had occurred and Lennie was to blame. Lennie was a friendly, child-like dimwitted man. What he lacked in brain power he made up tenfold in brawny. He had a large muscular build which enabled him to be a good worker. George on the other hand, was the complete opposite of Lennie. He was small but definitely smarter than his counterpart Lennie. George looked out for Lennie and tried to keep him out of trouble, albeit an impossible task.While reading the story you inevitably know the ending before you even get there. At every turn you are expecting the well intended Lennie to do something horrible. George tries to keep him in line and is successful for most of the story.The main idea is the search for happiness. George and Lennie are working to save enough money to buy their own land and work their own fields. George constantly reassures Lennie that they can achieve their goal and Lennie can have his rabbits to tend to. If Lennie ever slips up then George has to remind him of the future they intended.John Steinbeck has a tremendous ability to set up a visual representation of his story. In the beginning to every chapter, the landscapes and surroundings are vividly detailed making the reader actually believe he is there watching the events take place. Steinbeck follows his structure throughout the book. Each chapter sets up the scene and the conversations between characters tell the story for the remainder of the chapter.Each character in the story is well described. Always described upon first entering the story. Steinbeck also ensured that each person was flawed in some way. Each one had their good traits and their bad. George and Lennie seem to be the good guys in the story even though Lennie is a walking nightmare waiting to happen.You can tell George and Lennie develop a loving relationship. Lennie listens to George and George in return keeps an eye on Lennie. This is definitely a heavy burden placed on George. Finally, in the end Lennie slips up. He kills the boss' daughter-in-law. The event that was being set up all along. A lynch party is sent out to find Lennie. Ultimately it is George that find Lennie. George is forced to kill Lennie for his discretions. Lennie died at the hand of George whilst being promised that brighter future yet another time.Steinbeck makes it seem as though we're all searching for that brighter future that's just out of our grasp. This is one of those books that you can't put down. Although it is not a long read, it is extremely well written."

The author's use of interesting, human characters, quick dialogue and fast moving scenes is breathtaking- This is the only novel I have ever reread immediately after finishing it.I will not discuss the plot because everyone else has always done that. I will only say that this is one of the four or five most important books of my life thus far. It opened my door to American literature, and really gave me an appreciation for reading.After reading this, I was excited to read Steinbeck's ""best"" books, but it turned out I had already read it. Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, while both quite good, were both a little bit too long. Of Mice and Men, on the other hand, is not a word too long or too short. It's a beautiful, short character study, and you will be better for reading it."

Nicholson,1/1,5.0,1259280000,"'Of Mice and Men""...one of Steinbeck's finest works.","'Of Mice and Men' was written in 1937 by John Steinbeck. To me, one of his finest works.The setting is in the Gabilan mountain area of western California and although no specific dates are mentioned, probably around the time of the great depression. The two main protagonists are George and Lennie, two drifters that travel the area looking for seasonal work at harvest time. George is a small cunning man while Lennie is giant of a man, but with the mind of a child. Their wandering lifestyle is fueled by their dreaming about better days ahead and having their own place...as Lennie puts it, ""Can you imagine such a place, living off the fat of the lan'?"". However their future is about to drastically change in ways they can never suspect (or understand) and the dream is about to be shattered forever.Subjectively, I loved it all; the finest of writing, that not only features exquisite descriptive passages of barns, horses and of lazy, late summertime afternoons, but also the unique characters that go into making this depression era tale. And although the book is really just a longer, short story (just over 100 pages in length) it is the ever-so subtle increasing tension coupled with the real personalities, that makes this wonderful novel so hard to put down.If any complaint, it would be that the tale is so short; it's all over almost as soon as it's begun. However, it's quality over quantity. Easily, 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson"

(If you are a teacher and are teaching the novel, you might find it interesting to make the students predict, on the basis of the poem, what the outcome of the novel will be.)By the way, some critics say that OF MICE AND MEN is not a naturalistic novel, since George exercises his free will in his final decision.

So Lennie and George have been going from town to town, mostly because they can't stay in one place too long before Lennie makes a mistake, forcing them to flee. They get jobs at a ranch. They make friends, such as Candy, the swamper, Slim, the skinner, and crooks, the negro stable boy. However, life isn't so peachy keen at this ranch. The flirtatious wife of Curley, the bosses son, is a threat to everyone who works there. For Curley is a very possessive man, who will beat anyone up, who is bigger than he is (maybe even Lennie). Will Curley's wife, who doesn't seem to have a name, cause trouble for George and Lennie, maybe evening ruining their dream? Will Lennie's ignorance to his own strength cause trouble at this town also? Well, you should read the book to find out.

Lenny gets him and George in trouble a lot and George always says that he would be better off with out Lenny.

They stay for as long as their luck lasts, doing whatever the current job demands, but come what may George and Lennie stick together. George is small, fast to loose his temper and smart. Lennie is big, always affable and dim-witted. Lennie needs George to look after him, and George sometimes wishes that he was able to live life free and easy, free to gamble and booze his money away. Lennie's slow wit often gets him into trouble in the rough and tumble, male world of the rural society. Now ""a few miles south of Soledad"" George and Lennie are about to start a new job. Before they enter the property the two camp out overnight so George can enjoy the scenery. This proves to be the calm before the storm as the two are about to experience life-changing events.This is a short book, being just under 100 pages, but it contains much to be thought about. Steinbeck describes in detail the harsh way men choose to live. He notes how, in this environment, some men rise to become leaders, being hero-worshiped in such a way that their word becomes almost gospel in the minds of other men. But Stienbeck, through the friendship of George and Lennie, also notes that there is another, more caring way for men to live. Of course even those who follow a philosophy of caring live in the real world of struggle in which circumstances are not easy to resolve, and Steinbeck is well aware of this. Steinbeck's beliefs are informed by his knowledge of Christianity, but one does not have to slavishly follow that religion to agree with what he is saying. This book was first published in 1937, but is contains ideas that have finally flourished in the New Age Men's movement of the late Twentieth Century.This book is stylistically interesting. Steinbeck deliberately wrote his prose in a way which imitates plays (drama). Events take place in a set 'scene' and characters enter, interact and leave. Dialogue, rather than action, is emphasized. The author, indeed, later wrote a theater version of this story. He did the same thing with the book _The Moon is Down_. Through Steinbecks skillfully woven dialogue we gain a good understanding of his main characters and Lennie is one of his most poignant creations. The climaxes of this tale, and there are more than one, are also memorable.John Steinbeck is of course a famous author and this is one of his most well known novels. I am glad to say I did not find it in the least disappointing and I am very happy to award it five stars."

The one I most like was Lenny, because besides being mentally retarded, he was a very nice guy. I also like very much the way Steinbeck combined violence with authority and friendship.

The first is Lennie's killing of Curley's wife. This is shocking because Curley's father owns the farm, so Lennie could get into serious trouble. The second is when Lennie is hiding in the brush waiting for George, and he sees and hears Aunt Clara's ghost talking and later a rabbit talking. The third is not when George shoots Lennie, but when George walks away with Slim, as if the two are best pals now. This makes it seem that George did not take his friendship with Lennie very seriously, because instead of mourning his death alone, he hangs on to Slim, as if Lennie is easily replaceable and that Slim has taken Lennie's place now. I thought the ending makes George seem like a shady character, not bad enough to be called the villain, but still not good enough to be called hero of the book."

Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble.

John Steinbeck Author Of Mice and Men used this quote as an Allusion to his book where it foreshadows events that have yet to occur.According to the quote what it mean is you set yourself up to let yourself down. In the book Of Mice and Men two characters George and Lennie have a plan to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. Therefore both characters get a land job where their dreams just scrambles in a matter of weeks. Lennie actions led their dreams to be destroyed it was when they arrived to their new job and at the time one of the workers dog just had given birth to puppies. In which Lennie asked George permission to have one of the puppies and George said yes. Within a few weeks the dog died and was witness by the boss son's wife in which she was killed at the site. Seconds after the incident Lennie headed back to where George told him to go just in case he got into any trouble, which he did, at the end. As a result George headed to the site and killed Lennie before the men got a hold of him. In all both men are in screach of identity and in my point of view each character of this book are lonely in which they have trouble finding themselves. Overall this book shows great friendship amoung these two characters eventhough George gives Lennie a harsh treatment but it is the worst for the better. George shows how much he care for his other half and that he is willing to go all out for Lennie, he gudies him through for his own benefit. Incredible book as the Author uses great literary terms and expresses each and one of them. It profound me when Author John Steinbeck allusively used Robert Burns poem as an idea for his outcoming book. Lovely book and enjoyable reading it."

Lenny and George are in a way comedic, but heart wrenching and sad. They are known by even those that are unaware that they know them.

The author is a genius in the way he brings about the story of two very different men. The story of George and Lennie. George is a small but tough man who has an intense friendship with Lennie, a big but slow man.The context of this book is excellent although at the beginning of the book some people may say that it seems very boring, or that it has too many facts as in facts that are not needed. But that's only some people's opinion I believe that the beginning of the book is actually very important. It contains a lot of information that if not known you will not be able understand how George and Lennie end up together, and what was that caused them to end up looking for another job.Another brilliant thing that the author does is that he uses literary devices. The most important literary device that he uses is foreshadowing. In the book there is a incident in which one of the characters from the book named Candy has a dog that has been with him almost all his life and naturally like all animals age this dog became old and ill. The dog became so ill that two of the other characters believed that the best thing to do with the dog was to put him out of his misery by killing him.

One of which is George Milton, a farm hand who accepts the day labor and who has assumed the responsibility of taking care of his simple-minded friend Lenny. The other is Lennie Small, a large retarded man who has the mind of a child and who loves to pet soft and pretty things. Some other characters include Slim, a sympathetic a man who understands and comforts George when Lennie is killed, and Curley, a small, cocky, arrogant man who is the son of the boss. The setting of this book is in farm areas with few or little towns and vast areas of land surrounding the people that live there. I thought this book was quite interesting and a real page-turner. The book kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what Lennie would do next. I was in shocked to read some of the things Lennie did. Overall I suggest this book for anybody who likes a good book. George had heard of some harvesting jobs that are available on a nearby farm, so George and Lennie decided to walk there. They planned to camp out for the night and be at work the next morning. During the evening George was forced to take a dead mouse out of Lennie's hand because Lennie like to pet soft things. George then reminded Lennie of the trouble he had caused in the other town when Lennie tried to pet a little girl's dress. You must read on in the book to find out what happened during George and Lennie's journeys."

It also make me feel about how alone we are in this word, although we have people who love us. We live in a society that don't take in to account the importance of having friends, and a family. We are only thinking about what we really care not in the others.

However, the fact that made the story better is that the characters had many ideas. Although, I really like this book because its very interesting. Some people think the book was overwhelming because they liked it so much. Besides, I learned many more things about the book while I was reading it. To conclude, I recommend that I should give the book a five stars because its really fun and understanding to read.I understand that Of Mice and Men was the author of John Steinbeck. He is the American author who writes differnt kind of books about good and evil. Somehow, he created the book himself by working hard successfully. He even won many awards because of his novel and creativeness. However, he makes lots of money to improve his skills of writing. Also, Steinbeck was born in Salinas Valley where he works hard even more. He is the legend author who writes books among others.I think that John Steinbeck is a great author because he works really hard every freakin day.

Even though the book only covers a three-day span, it portrays the full spectrum of human emotions including physical pain, tenderness, friendship, pity, and jealousy. Steinbeck's sensitivity for the common man is evident in this work and the others produced during the 1930's. It has been claimed by many that this period saw Steinbeck's greatest works. The social injustices of the 1930's are depicted in Of Mice and Men. His political concerns for equality and happiness for society is a major theme in this novel and his concern for the poor and below average is also evident.The protagonists, George Milton and Lennie Smalls, are laborers looking for work on a small farm in Salinas Valley, California. Lennie, the bigger of the two, is mentally slow and this seems to always get him in trouble. George stays with Lennie to take care of him after his Aunt Clara died. They both had big dreams of owning a ranch. This is another one of Steinbeck's major themes, the search for the American Dream. However, for Lennie and George the American Dream, to buy the ranch and &quot;live off the fatta the land,&quot; is not achieved because of their limitations.Slim, Curley, Curley's wife, Candy, and Crooks, the antagonists, work at the farm along with George and Lennie. This is where many conflicts happen, such as the fight between Lennie and Curley. The final conflict between George and Lennie at the river brings to reality the importance of friendship and the desperation of loneliness.This novel is also famous because it depicts Steinbeck's well-known style of writing, which includes such literary devices as symbolism, irony, metaphors, parallelism, alliteration, and repetition. In the opening paragraph by repeating such words as, &quot;with the...&quot; the author easily moves from one repetition to another. Some of his descriptive sentences, like where he describes &quot;The path through the willows,&quot; have a rhythmic quality that adds poetic meaning to this novel. Another device Steinbeck uses is the simile. His phrase &quot;the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones&quot; is a striking example.I really enjoyed reading Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. Its down to earth humor shows compassion in a time where there was none. I really liked his characters and how they are developed in the story. They are believable and bring out the appropriate emotions in the reader. Steinbeck's use of simple plot, natural dialogue, and natural setting, makes this an easy and enjoyable book to read. This timeless classic is a book that I would recommend to anyone, for it is a story that withstands many readings by many generations."

Their names are George and Lennie. George always has to take care of himself as well as Lennie. Lennie is a challenged individual, but he is the sweetest man. He really means well. The way he talks and acts reflects that he is a little boy stuck in a strong mans body. Lennie is by far my favorite character in this book. Lennie has an obsession with touching soft things. At the beginning of the book it starts with Lennie having a mouse in his pocket which he accidentally kills because he strokes the mouse to hard. He felt horrible. George, who is always taking care of Lennie, is more of a dad to Lennie than a friend. He was asked by Lennie's Aunt Clara to look after Lennie when she died. Throughout the story George continues to look after Lennie wherever they go.Both George and Lennie have a life goal of having a place of their own with land, a house, and animals. They have a place that they can buy from an older couple, but they need to get six-hundred and fifty dollars to buy it from them. They are working to get this money so they can run off and escape from the working world and ""live offa the fatta the lan' (Steinbeck 56)."" Throughout the book they travel to find a place to work so they can get the amount of money that they need in order to buy that piece of land. They find a farm that will take both of them as workers and that is where the majority of the story takes place. Most of the people that are working at the farm really like George and Lennie, except for the farm owners's son, Curly. Eventually Lennie and Curly get into a fight. Lennie accidentally crushes Curly's hand. Another incident between Lennie and Curly occurs toward the end of the book that angers Curly to the point that he is ready to kill Lennie.I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. One because it was easy to follow and always kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I could not put the book down. I sat down and read the entire book all at once. Another reason is because it was one of those books that are short enough that you can sit down and read the whole story in a few hours. The book also had an interesting story plot. There was one part of this book that I did not like. I was disappointed when Steinbeck made Lennie look like a bad guy for part of the story. An example is when Lennie kills the mouse at the beginning of the book. Lennie has good and honest intentions. I felt so bad for him that I almost started to cry. Lennie felt horrible every time he did something to hurt someone or something in the book because he did not understand his own strength. I really like how George is a father figure to Lennie and how Lennie really appreciates George. Lennie understands that George will always there for him. The two men give each other a reason to live. George and Lennie truly value each other's friendship. I recommend this book for all boys and girls, child or adult."

Gonna get a little place an' live on the fatta the lan'""","One of the most incredible things that I have found reading Steinbeck is his ability to manipulate my mind set and opinions of his characters. I found this most relevant in OF MICE AND MEN.Though I had nothing in common with either of the main characters, in no time I started to relate to them through their emotions of lonliness and that desperation to find an ideal to cling to and look forward to. Taking the journey with them to the farm and interacting with the other people helping, Steinbeck tells a beautifully written story through dialogue. This story has detailed, but limited descriptions of settings. I for one really enjoyed this aspect after reading GRAPES OF WRATH which has both vivid descriptions and dialogue.Through the book, the reader witnesses Lennie constantly being lectured for every action he makes but still stays loyal and warm to George. This story actually reminded me of an abusive relationship when I first started reading it. George, being the abuser, is extremely negative, and verbally abusive to Lennie. Yet, the reader can feel how much love he has for Lennie as well. At first I hated George. He reminded me of Mo from the Three Stooges. I hated seeing him be so controlling and unkind to Lennie. As the story unfolded though I warmed up to George until the last pages where I went through a stage of shock, and then anger, and then pity for George. To bring all those emotions out of someone within about fifteen pages I was fully impressed.I only wish I would've gotten the opportunity to read this in school instead of reading it on my own so I could compare perspectives and opinions on the book."

The depression is the backdrop for the story but that does not prevent Lennie and George from dreaming big. Steinbeck paints a masterful and brilliant portrait of a bygone era that still resonates today. Every time I read this book it reads differently. This is required reading for most high schools. Fifteen years after I originally read I still love it. However, the difference between reading it at 14 and 28 is amazing.

Lennie and George are running away from their old town of Weed because a woman charged Lennie with rape. Lennie is a little bit retarded and likes to touch soft things. George is Lennie's Aunt Clara died so now he's the responsible guardian.There are two main settings in this great novel. First, in the brush where they stay one night. There were many trees and bushes. There was also a pond where the two of them drank from. This was important because if Lennie ever got in trouble George told him to come to this place. The other setting was the ranch where they got their money. The people on the ranch were the boss, Curly, Carlson, Curly's wife, Candy, Slim and Crooks. The two of them bucked barley and there was Crooks house, the bunk house, the main house.George and Lennie are hobo's so they travel together. George always tells Lennie that they're going to ""live off the fatta the lan"" (Steinbeck pg.105) which means they're going to have nuts and berries and Lennie can feed alfalfa to the rabbits. George isn't physically strong but he is mentally and Lennie is physically strong but not mentally so they help each other all the time.I would recommend this book for 8th-12th grade students and adults because it has some language that isn't appropriate for younger kids. I would also recommend the audio tape that goes with the book because Gary Sinise, the narrator, expresses the characters excellently.

It tells the story of the two friends, George (the smart one) and Lennie (the dumb one), whom have no family, and no place that they can call ""home"". To make a living Lennie and George work on the different farms around, trying to save up money. They have a dream of buying a place of their own. A piece of land where they can grow their own crop and where Lennie can have rabbits.

The story takes place during the Great Depression in Salinas, California on a ranch.Lennie is big, forgetful,mentally challenged but over all thar's what makes him so loveable.George on the other hand is the complete opposite of Lennie; he's a small, smart, and speaks his mind so they kind of balance each other out.

George is small and smart, and George is big and mentally challenged. George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in ""some trouble"". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble.This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant.George isn't the only example of ""human compassion"". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best.Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue. There is precious little description in this book, but that's okay because most of the emotion of the story is conveyed through dialogue."

Lennie and George are the best of friends and have been for years now. George and Lennie are looking for a job and have found one but they have to walk there because the bus driver dropped them off saying that where they want to go is only a couple of miles down the road. It ends up being ten miles that George and Lennie have to walk and so the end up having to spend the night outside because they need to rest. After walking all of this way the two men are starving but all they have to eat is beans because it is the great depression and not many people can afford much else.George and Lennie are the best of friends because they look out for one another. Well it's mostly George looking out for Lennie because Lennie is a little slower than most and doesn't always understand things the first time around. So George and Lennie go from one place to another looking for work because most people don't respond very positively to Lennie because of the way that he is. Lennie just likes to touch soft things and that is what makes him happy and feel warm inside. Since Lennie is so big and he doesn't know his strength and ends up killing the little animals that he loves to pet so dearly. So that is how George and Lennie ended up on the farm, and there is where everything came to an end.George and Lennie got there to work, and while there Lennie fell in love with some puppies that were barely born. Lennie couldn't stand to be away from those puppies when he didn't have to. While spending time with the puppies Curley's wife went into the barn to talk to Lennie and she found out that he liked to touch soft things and had him touch her hair. Lennie liked it's softness so much that he didn't want to let go and got scared and accidentally killed Curley's wife. This was a very bad thing and he knew it so he went to hide in the brush like George told him to do if he ever did a bad thing. When they found the body everyone knew that Lennie was the man responsible so they all went looking for him to kill him. George knew that the only way that Lennie would not be really punished for what he did was if George killed him himself. That is exactly what George did and it was the only thing that could have been done to really save Lennie. The book was very serious and stayed that way throughout the novel.This book talked about very serious subjects and didn't change throughout the book. George and Lennie just want their own farm and the ability to do whatever they please from the beginning and that doesn't change throughout the book. In the beginning of the book George expresses that he is tired of having to always worry about Lennie and that George would be much better off by himself. Throughout the novel George doesn't change and while he does take Lennie with him everywhere he goes he still feels the same, and he knows that even though at the end when he has to kill Lennie it is the best for everyone because if he wouldn't have done it Lennie never would have been able to live a truly happy life with no worries.During the end of the book when George knew that he had to kill Lennie and just let Lennie keep talking about his dreams of the rabbit farm and George killed him was the most moving seen for me because there is nothing worse than killing someone you love not because you want to but because you have to. I think that the author was trying to give everyone who read this book a feel for what it is that people who are like Lennie have to go through. The author I think was trying to make everyone realize that they are people too and they really don't know some of the things that they should and it isn't their fault. I learned that you should always give people chances no matter who they are or what battles they may be facing in their lives at that time. This novel didn't really remind me of anything it just showed me that everyone deserves a chance and the ability to express themselves in any way they chose and no one should judge them for that.I felt that this book was very well written and overall just a great book. It shows you how judgmental and naive some people can be and why you shouldn't be like that. This gives you a perspective of how people like Lennie feel and what obstacles they have to go through because people won't give them the chance to get to know them. I learned that know matter who you are you are no better than the people you think are, they in fact are better than you because they unlike you are willing to give you the chance that everyone deserves."

I found the descriptive style curt, while still being beautifully evocative. There is a lovely sense of space and movement to his backdrops.The two characters Lennie and George make for an immediately adorable duo. Lennie's childlike glea and innocence makes you want to just stop and hug him from his very first line. You feel an overwhelming urge to want to protect him from the big bad world that George is all too aware of.The journey details their search for work as farm handlers and their ambition to fulfill their dream of one day owning their own land. Lennie must surely be one of the great literary characters of the 20th century. He's looked down upon as a weirdo by most of the people he meets, when in fact he's too good for them. He deserves better.A philosophical novel that's impossible to put down (I read it in 1 day), I found it a great introduction to Steinbeck. A classic to be recommended without reservation."

I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched.

As we read the book, we started realising how hard life can be when youre living and working on a ranch. We also realised how important it is to have dreams and someone to share them with. 'Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world ' this frase, is what we think what the whole book is based on. There are several characters in the book that feel recognised by this frase. Such as Candy and Crooks. Candy was an old man that had only one hand. Ever since his dog was killed he started feelling empty and lonely. After coming to an agreement with George and Leannie, he became part of their dream. Violence was a key point of this story. There were many scenes of violence and agression. for example: the last one when George finds Leannie in the bushes and then kills him because Carson and Curly were eventually going to kill Leannie since he had previously killed Curleys wife. In our opinion this book was very well written. You couldn't put it down for one second. We hope that we will read another book by John Steinbeck."

From my point of view, I believe that this book's not just written upon the subject of discrimination of our social society, but it is written to show the loneliness of people and the effects of being lonely.. For example, the wife of Curley, the son of the owner of the farm, acts of more flutterishly toward because of her isolated life from the people of the world, and her preference of attention from everyone caused from this loneliness..., and also the old man Candy kept his dog to escape from his own world loneliness. The main characters George and Lennie are also affected by being lonely. George has a habit of petting everything because from petting something you are sure of the fact that you are touching something that is alive, to enjoy the feeling of being next to someone escaping from the loneliness. George also tries to escape his loneliness by thinking of his dream house, where everyone will be happy and satisfied of their life. Of course I'm not saying that the idea of the book is not written upon the subject of prejudice but I'm just expressing my own opinion. So no hard feelings -_-;; lol"

The only complaint I have about the book is that characters first names are all so similar that the reader must continually consult the family tree at the beginning of the book. The book is an astonishing achievement of literature, and the reader must be willing to suspend belief and be challenged. For me, this book was a bit like water: fluid and moving, reflecting, rushing or still. It has so many qualities that are had to put words to.

People will often say about an author ""There's nobody like them.."" and that's especially true for Garcia Marquez. This isn't a traditional novel, and I can't guarantee you'll love it. Like a lot of great Latin America fiction, it just isn't for some people. However, if you love Latin American writers and for some reason haven't read Marquz's masterpiece, I recommend you do so as soon as possible. The novels plot, in so much as it has a plot, is documenting a family, the Buendia's, over a period of one hundred years. The family is imperfect and dysfunctional to say the least, but are also very powerfully described, and by the end you will know them so well you'll feel as if you know them personally.I would also recommend getting the Everyman's library version of this book. It is well bound, beautiful and will hold together. And I don't know if other versions have this or not, but it has a Buendia family tree at the beginning, which is helpful for telling apart characters, as their names are often nearly identical. As one review put it, it leaves you with a pleasant exhaustion that only very great novels provide. There are very few books I've enjoyed as much as this one, and I recommend you at least give it a shot. Even if you put it down for a while, I'm willing to bet you will be drawn back to it before long. It's interesting and well written, with all of the magic you'd expect from a Latin American great, and it's definitely worth a read."

The elements of magical realism were as touching as they were astonishing. But I never grew unaccustomed to the book's pace, which moves herky-jerky through the decades, sometimes focusing on a single event for pages, then leaping several weeks in a single sentence.

No need to re-hash.Instead a brief meditation on the book's magical realism and its effect the narrator-character-reader relationship.The chronology of the book and its unusual treatment of character create a distancing effect. There are plenty of characters here and plenty of insightful moments with them but the narrator fleets between characters, and glances between intimate stays and vast summaries. This is clearly not a book that is read for character development (compared to a book that catalogs the life of a single character), understandable, but there is also a distancing effect caused by a lack of genuine sentiment. Often (even when we have rested with Ursula for many pages, or when we see the young Aureliano looking up to his father) this book feels as though it takes place in an alternate universe where the inhabitants are almost human, but different in a hard-to-place way. Uncanny valley, without the disturbing factor. Unlike Kafka's or even Grass's treatment of the surreal/magical, where the character is very thoroughly human in thought and action, Marquez's characters think and act in manners as stylized as the events. There is a charming, fairy-tale effect to this, but there is also a divorce of emotion both from the narrator and the reader. This seems to be a mark of Marquez (excuse me there), where his characters are either too stoic or too emotive and they never quite act as ordinary people. Does this further establish the enchanted world of Macondo as a place where the reader goes to frolic, to be dismayed, overjoyed, to be transported through time? Or does it act as a barrier, a pane of glass through which everything becomes two-dimensional? It depends on the reader."

The novel is simultaneously the story of several generations of an extended family and the story of the entire human race from the beginning of history. It is full of magic not only in the sense that magical things happen, but also in its glowing prose and deeply sympathetic portrayals of its characters. The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members. Maybe it doesn't matter if we keep their identities straight, and maybe we're not even supposed to. Let the plot swirl and let Marquez work his magic.

It is very interesting to read a book with such a broad scope with a group of people available for discussion throughout. It is safe to say that there are few themes this novel leaves out.

Unfortunately, it is also a very difficult book to read because of the confusion caused by repetitive names, the reality mixed with fable style of the narrative, and the pace of the novel which jumps around constantly. This poses a problem for someone like myself who often likes to read on the bus or just for a few minutes before I go to sleep--I could not get in a ryhthm and would forget important details so the book did not always make sense. When I had time to concentrate it was beautifully written, intense, and interesting, so I would highly recommend it for someone with the time to really delve into and read it in long stretches.

Perhaps one more will tip you over the edge, and you will buy the bookThis fantastical tale is based around the life of the Buendia family and the village that they founded, Macondo. While epic in its scale (one hundred years) it does not read like an epic. Rather, it is like listening to an old relative recount past ancestors, with a decidedly magical-realism spin. This book is beautifully written (and translated, by Gregory Rabassa) with some of the most evocative and lyrical prose you are likely to come across. Yet it is still a very sturdy story - while you could read it for the craftsmanship of the words alone, you would miss a very good tale. Marquez has the interesting technique of referring to events in his stories before they happen, so you joyfully look out for events coming up.A word of warning - make sure that the edition that you buy/borrow/steal has a copy of the family tree in the beginning - with so many characters having the same name, and the branches of the family being so entwined, you will find yourself referring to it time and again. And don't be put off by the number of pages - even though it has over 400, it never bogs down.

2232,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A2G1Z591G9QWQC,danielle,4/5,4.0,1118880000,Mind-boggling!,"In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez writes of a fictional, mystical town called Macondo. The world is still recent and young, but one must question how young the world is due to conflicting descriptions in the book. One of the village's main founding members is Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia and his wife Ursula. With these two people start the beginning of six generations of the Buendia family in Macondo. Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia seeks knowledge all the time, and an important traveling gypsy named Melquiades helps out Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia in his quest. Melquiades actually records important prophecies of the village that are not decoded until the village's last days. Macondo starts off peacefully, and nobody dies for many years, but as time goes on, wars between the Liberals and the Conservatives rage with some members of the Buendia family executed, and capitalism takes its root with a banana company that leaves many massacred in a strike not recorded by the history books.Jos&eacute; Arcadio Buendia actually becomes insane because he realizes that time is cyclical and always repeating itself. In the six generations that follow, characters have the same names or names with slight variations, hinting at a cyclical history. Many instances must refer to past events to determine the future. A surreal air in this book is the result of many events and bustling people. Some members of the family live for abnormally long periods of time; dead characters never really die because their ghosts stay in Macondo; a pure and beautiful Buendia girl rises to heaven; and passionate (and sometimes incestuous) relationships flourish all the time. While some of the Buendia men are very hedonistic, especially for women, many men in the Buendia family have an air of solitude around them and never form true relationships with others. At the end of the book, the solitude of one of the Buendias is what brings the demise of the mystical town.One Hundred Years of Solitude, a book on distorted reality and cyclical history, is one of the most mind-boggling books I have ever encountered, and even though the book was very difficult to grasp, I'd say the 400+ pages were worth the magical trip. Marquez is a master storyteller, and although there were parts that were agonizingly long, the book as a whole is to be commended as a magical classic."

He said, ""Most critics don't understand a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit of joke.--they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves."" I'm glad to know that at least the author wasn't fooled by his mediocre work.Throughout the book there is no uplifting or cathartic passage; the supposedly comical elements don't make you laugh; the tragic episodes don't make you cry; the style is unpolished; ""magical realism"" is used indiscriminately; and so are the words ""solitude"" and ""solitary"" which appear in every few pages. In the book practically everyone and everything is solitary. It's a red-tag sale of Solitudes. Yet, their solitude is merely circumstantial. It is not the type of haunting or ennobling solitude you find in Kafka's or Camus' work. Even in ""Hijo de hombre"" (Buenos Aires, 1961) by the contemporary Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos, different characters from an impoverished village carry their true cross of solitude silently and bravely without even being aware of it.The book is worth reading only for the purpose of pondering why it has gained such popularity and acclaim."

Draper,3/4,5.0,1240963200,"I loved the Novel, but not the ""book"" (edition)","Thumbs up to Gabriel Garcia Marquez' fantastical epic novel, ""100 years of Solitude""! It is the story of Macondo, a fictional South American town founded by the bold patriarch of the Buendia clan, Jose Arcadio Buendia. Twenty households of folks subsist in peace and relative isolation, minding their own business, until hosts of visitors and newcomers, bringing new ideas--scientific, political, and economic--descend upon the sleepy village. These developments, along with the growth and development of the Buendias through generations, lead to unexpected and often bizarre and tragic results.Marquez' imagination seems to know no bounds, as he recounts story after incredible story in ridiculous detail, which are bound together with certain common recurring themes. The style of the novel, ""magical realism"", means that the most freakish stories are told in the same matter-of-fact tone as the most prosaic ones. Marquez grew up in the home of his grandparents, natural story tellers, who related countless such tall-tales in such a way, blurring the boundaries of reality and unreality. My favorite of these tall tales is the part, toward the end of the book where it rains for ""four years, eleven months, and two days"". What they went through during that time was hilarious and outlandish!Another big theme is the recurring personalities of the male Buendias across five generations. The author does a good job of creating real and interesting characters, but I particularly enjoyed some of the female ones, as they were each quite different and extraordinary. Ursala, the matriarch, is a central central figure who lives over a hundred years, during which she works endlessly to care for the family throughout the generations. Fernanda, the wife whom Aureliano Segundo takes from a ruined aristocratic family in ""the Highlands"", never really fits in. The best Fernanda scene is during the rainy season, when she drones on complaining at Aureliano for an incredible three pages with just one sentence!One of the many themes in the book that interest me is the strong sense of irony which pervades the novel on many levels. The overriding irony which also underlies the whole story is the circular nature of time--the recurring personality types and their dysfunctional actions which they seem doomed to repeat. This is an irony of tragic futility. At times it seems tedious, but the author uses it to brilliant effect, and particularly at the end, where the story culminates with one surprising final ironic twist.These are just a few of my ideas and reflections about this monumental work. Lastly, I suggest that you buy one of the other editions of the book because this one is rather flimsy and cheaply made. The Oprah book club edition (which I have not seen) can be had for $7.00, including shipping, and the hardback for $11.12, if you click on the words ""32 new"". I hope this helps. Enjoy!"

2241,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A3CWR2XUP8C9X1,Ozzbucket88,6/7,5.0,1244505600,Cruel and with no redemptive value,"This is a hard book to read. It is equally despising and depressing, and somewhat boring in its literalness of the biblical-style apocalyptic approach to the whole fiasco that is the comedy of Latin America. But at its surface (and the novel is entirely a surface phenomenon because of its literalness) there are levels of cruelty unimagined by any other writer, and maybe for this the novel deserves its distinction. Jose Arcadio Buendia, a former god-believing man hoping to acquire science (because he doesn't want to ""live like donkeys"") then losing his faith (because the ""daguerreotype proves god's inexistence"") declares after extensive investigation that the earth is round (""like an orange"") and ends with him going crazy (in the deadest of dead languages, Latin). Garcia-Marquez saves the worst cruelty for the son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who hopes for military glory and meaning to his life, but who instead is thrown back into the dark pit of memory and regret, dragging around military failure and indecision like a paralyzed limb, despising everything, women, ideals, etc. And introducing vultures at his death just seemed to underscore the literalness and cruelty of the text as a whole. Every other Buendia after them is parodic of the modern man or woman. Choose the degeneracy, and Marquez embodies it in a later Buendia: the libertine, the glutton, the free spirit, philanderer, the rake, the reprobrate, isolationist. All of these are present to some extent in Jose Arcadio Buendia or Colonel Aureliano Buendia, but they are not definitive of and do not circumscribe their personalities as they do in the later Buendias. And of these later Buendias Marquez depicts their downfall like roaches being stamped out, in the blackest of black humor, which is why readers complain about the unheroic qualities, the hollowness and boredom of succeeding generations, which is the whole point. Marquez detests his world (not in the beginning which is idyllic, but its later manifestations) and weaves his story with the cruelty this form of detestation takes: Locked in fatalistic moments as inescapable as Homer's, whether living tediously (usually the women) or dying early (usually the men) for they-don't-know-what. The Buendia men utter stupid things before being executed and wholly misunderstand their existence. And there are no gods to lighten things up, like in the Iliad. War is farcical (Ursula reminds them that although they are soldiers, their ""mothers reserve the right to take down their pants and spank them""). Loyalty is literally a laughing matter (the illegal painting of ballot cards being the spur for Aureliano to choose political sides, because one side is ""trickier than the other""). There isn't even a redemptive figure, like in the Bible. There is a level of literalness here which is juvenile (e.g. names as determinants of behavior), almost nave for a modern novel, until you realize the meticulous stage-setting for destruction taking place. The novel doesn't suffer from too much fantasy, it's mired in too much depressive reality. The fantasy only leavens it a bit, but this doesn't distract from the cruelty being perpetrated. Sex is of course freely enjoyed (and that taboo, incestual sex) but this sensual mirage is only a distraction, for the characters and the reader, from what's happening right before their eyes. The book has no political, philosophical, or sociological agenda, moral or immoral. The only point, foretold in the beginning and coming at the end, is eventual extinction, which is hardly a point. Although it is better than the Bible and the Iliad, by being crueler, the reader should beware: this novel is like a Toltec or Aztec statue, one with snakes for heads and hearts and severed hands for necklaces, unimpressive at first sight until you do a complete 360 survey of it and realize it fits right into the cruel landscape their sculptors inhabited. And there is no way out. Everything is there on the surface. There is no redemptive value in this kind of fiction. It doesn't extend outside itself. Multiple readings do not yield multiple levels of meaning. It means everything it says."

I found A Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting, Maribou Storke Nightmares and Slaughterhouse Five all easier to read than this and most of those took some work. It doesn't have anything to do with the words or dialog.

It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be?

2245,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,J. E. Barnes,11/12,5.0,1089072000,Human Frailty In An Infinite Universe,"Gabriel Garcia Marquez' groundbreaking masterpiece '100 Years of Solitude' (1967) is both a comic and a tragic meditation on numberless vagaries of human existence.As the book's title suggests, the novel details the history of three generations in the Buendia family, who found the small, isolated, and swamp-surrounded South American town of Macondo during the 19th century. As an authentic and frequently unprecedented work of literature, '100 Years of Solitude' stands as a robust and healthy challenge to the social, religious, and literary excesses of Protestantism, to which it offers a brilliantly colored, deeply felt, and sensual alternative. With its underpinnings in pagan Catholicism, '100 Years of Solitude' boils over with a psychologically profound, brash, visceral, and distinctly Latin vision of life.Flying freely in the face of Western scientific and philosophical rationalism, the novel offers its readers plagues of forgetfulness, sleeplessness, and clouds of yellow butterflies, ascensions by the living into the heavens, lifelong correspondences with ""invisible doctors,"" ""suspicions of elves,"" and rain storms and droughts that continue for years on end. One character senses that the Buendias are caught in a tight chronal frame of eternal reoccurrence, while another, perceiving a world without genuine boundaries of any kind, plucks knowledge from a collective unconscious floating in the air while claiming ""everything is known.""Though levitating priests, flying carpet-riding Arabs, fraternal twins who trade destinies, and miraculous inventions abound, the novel never strays very far from its genuine and sincerely felt focus on the vicissitudes of the perpetually vulnerable, desiring, and inherently daydreaming nature of man. Among other things, '100 Years of Solitude' is also a profound meditation on the absurdly barbaric nature of war and the greedy, egotistical, and shortsighted character of the political arena.The Buendia family produces--and keeps producing--two basic kinds of men: idealistic, solitary, single-minded, and creative introverts, represented by the family's patriarch, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, and the more virile, self-serving, and callous hedonists best represented by sexually potent near-giant Jose Arcadio.Only the perceptive, long-suffering, and ancient family matriarch, Ursula Iguaran, struggles to maintain an objective and ordered understanding of the generally Dionysian chaos that surrounds and eventually envelopes her extended brood. For Ursula, there is little if any relief ever, as the forces of nature and ungainly human passion continuously destroy and deface the fruits of the family's often admirable labors. In the extended, complex, and secretive tangle of Macondo interrelationships, it is Ursula who consciously struggles to prevent incestuous couplings; her continuous prophecy that unbridled lust and misguided emotional liaisons will eventually produce a monster, ""a child with the tail of a pig,"" resounds throughout the book.The theme of human solitude is underscored as the one constant and dependable fact of human existence. Every character, by the very nature of their individuality, as well as by the simple hard truths of procreation, is set apart from the others in some distinct but irrevocable manner, whether it be their otherworldly beauty, idiot nature, inherent reflexivity, or a traumatizing episode in their childhoods. Living together in the vast Buendia complex, which is continually collapsing and being rebuilt, the characters often spend months in silence or near silence, even during periods of prosperity and relative happiness.Some characters happily board themselves up in shuttered rooms and become unwashed hermit scholars, while others, quietly planning illusory acts of revenge in response to illusory wrongs, simply don't speak out of spite for the span of their lifetimes.Some lose their minds as a result of their shattered dreams and obsessive memories of youthful promise. Ghosts of the dead walk the rooms and corridors too, equally isolated in death as in life. One comparatively minor character, Santa Sofia de la Piedad, like Georgina Hogg in Muriel Spark's 'The Comforters' (1957), simply ceases to exist from time to time at the author's whim.Even the more blithe and extroverted characters express themselves predominantly through action rather than words, and for all except Ursula, the stifling burden of unconsciousness is easier to bare than the sustained effort that consciousness requires.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has said that '100 Years of Solitude' came to him in ""an illumination,"" a statement that the novel's warm, organic, and fluidly archetypal prose bears out completely.Unlike the later 'Love in the Time of Cholera' (1985), the author's discerning, discriminating, and intruding hand is never sensed. Although frequently funny, brilliantly sustained passages of imaginative and fantastic material (some reminiscent of the Washington Irving of ""Knickerbocker's History Of New York,"" ""Dolph Heyliger,"" and ""Wolfert Webber"") are often followed by short, terse sentences of extreme brutality, such as one concerning a child hacked to death with a machete for spilling a drink on an arrogant soldier's uniform.The novel's conclusion, which unhappily recalls several of Edgar Allen Poe's short stories, may seem inevitable to some readers, while others may find it something of a betrayal of the book's overall tone. Regardless, the glorious miracle that is human existence, and a sense of the inherent, if often hidden, possibilities in all things are sumptuously served up for the reader in passage after passage.Throughout, '100 Years of Solitude' offers a compassionate, beatific vision that, while free of hard-edged moralizing, also never swerves away from the unpleasant truths inherent in human nature and man's finite physical existence. Though the repetitious names of many of the characters can become disheartening (5 major and 17 minor characters, for instance, share the name ""Aureliano""), like Muriel Spark's 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1963), it is a novel that can appreciated and understood by all people, regardless of nationality, social status, educational level, or background."

This tremendous novel is so pressed with humanity that you will suspect that every person you know will be able to relate to some aspect of it. One Hundred Years of Solitude is the story of the Buendia family, a dynasty that inhabits the mythical village of Macondo for ten decades until the last of their line breathes his last breath. The cast of characters continually changes as new Buendias are born, grow up and die. Mr. Marquez invents a singular, mystical air for each of his characters, charging each of their tales with enchantment, wonderment and meaning. In the span of their existences, some of the family seek love, others solitude; some serenity, others uprising; some industry, others intimacy. Regardless of his or her life's pursuit, each member of this family is absolutely unforgettable and very easy to sympathize with. Some novels incorporate a tremendous range of the uniformly important aspects of life. This is certainly one of them."

If this was the best or worse desicion of my life i don't know, by one side it was the best one because i found my favorite book and writer aswell, but on the other hand it can also be the worse because no longer can i be conformed to reading light novels that do not make me feel as much reality in fictitious facts as they words of Garcia Marquez made me feel.

I had to come on here and read some negative reviews of this book to make sure I wasn't totally crazy. After doing so, I feel a bit better, but still feel the need to add this:Yes, it annoyed me that all the characters have the same name, and unlike other reviewers, this was not something I was willing to either overlook, get used to, or appreciate for it's symbolism, (i.e. that the individual characters aren't supposed to matter, it's the family).Also, I couldn't stand how a paragraph would run an entire page without breaking, and if you skip a line or two, you miss A LOT. For example, in one paragraph, spanning one page, a character may have a child, but the focus of the section is more on the character's father than the new family member. Or a character may die, and you would entirely miss it. It's like trying to read someone's stream of consciousness and decipher a very intricate plot line from it: infuriating.Some other negative reviews mentioned issues with the morality of the story, which actually does not bother me in the slightest. I can appreciate a story that bares the ugly insides of the human soul with the best of them. The politics of the story were not a deal-breaker for me, it was the writing style.This all being said, I am perfectly comfortable with the fact that many (if not most) other people reading this review feel sorry for me for missing the point. I probably did miss the point, but I do feel better knowing that I wasn't the only one. I now feel like can stop torturing myself by forcing myself to read the last couple of chapters."

It is a fascinating novel, full of dozens f plots that wind through a land where magic is part of daily life.We follow the Buend&iacute;a family through the town's founding and the first Jose Arcadio Buend&iacute;a, throughout several generations to the books conclusion. In the beginning, the town of Maconda is a peaceful town isolated from the rest of the world, save for gypsies who visit every year, bringing new amazing things with them. Eventually the town, and the Buend&iacute;a family, lose their isolation as civil war, innovation and industry (in the form of the Banana company) sweep in.One Hundred Years of Solitude is hands down the best book I have read this year. It is not an easy read, but it is worth it. As much a philosophical study as an entertaining novel, you can read as much, or as little, into the story as you wish. There are complex themes blended with funny stories and exciting and surreal mini-plots. It is written in the style of ""Magical Realism,"" and there are several events throughout the book that are totally unexplained, and you are just forced to take them for what they are. Surprisingly, this is not as hard to do as you might think. The book has a great flow and you find yourself sucked into the lives of the Buend&iacute;a family.M&aacute;rquez does an amazing job of mixing fantasy with reality and weaving them into a moving novel. The loneliness and desperation of Colonel Aureliano Buend&iacute;a is palpable throughout the war years, and the theme of desperation pervades the whole book. When a character finds its way out of the city, such as when Remedios the Beauty rises to heaven, one feels elation for that character that they found a way to escape. Despite the sense of apathy that surrounds the book, the short anecdotal story lines keep the book from becoming bogged down and boring.The hardest part of reading this book was keeping some of the names straight. Several of the male characters have the same two names (Aureliano or Jose Arcadio), and many of the lives are so intertwined that even those with names that are not similar are still easy to confuse. This was a detail I became accustomed to however, and there was a family tree included in the beginning of the book that helped to clarify thing.While One Hundred Years of Solitude, may not be light reading, it is a novel worth finishing (If for no other reason that to finally put all of the story-lines missing plot pieces together.) Like all good novels, there are questions in the book that are answered in the end and others that we can only answer ourselves. If you are looking for a book to challenge you and at the same time entertain you I highly recommend One Hundred Years of Solitude."

The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale.

Perhaps the finest example of this truth is this novel by Garcia Marquez. A metaphor of Colombia's history it may be, but that interpretation would be excessively narrow. Garcia Marquez creates a world with its own physical rules, its own gods and its own destiny. It traces the story of the Buendia family and Macondo, the town they founded and that will exist as long as the lineage exists. Of course, this is a thoroughly unpredictable novel, precisely because it does not follow the rules of the world we live in. The characters are complex but they are archetypical. Another revieweer correctly described the categories and personalities of women and men, and of the people sharing a particular name. This novel prompted the surge of &quot;magical realism&quot; and modern Latin American literature. Unfortunately although predictably, many bad imitations have followed, like the very bad &quot;Like water for chocolate&quot;. Don't read imitations, come to the real thing where unbelievable events happen without ever becoming corky.The novel has biblical aspirations, and I could feel that throughout it all. It will rain for forty years; a man will stay enclosed in his room for years; a blood stain will wander the town. Extremely well written, it is a demandind text, not to be read while answering phone calls. Its beauty remains unsurpassed in its genre.

2258,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,AOATU8HTGEXYV,Varsha,3/5,3.0,1082592000,"Intermittent magic, but mainly real","If magic realism means magic in parts and mundanely real in other parts, then the book was faithful to that style. I must admit feeling cheated at the end to discover that what we had journeyed through was just Melquiade's script. On the whole, it was pretty laborious reading - even for a rapacious reader like me. The book is mainly a linear narrative punctuated only scantily by actual dialogue. This makes it rather tedious as you have to trudge through a lot of narration before you arrive at actual dialogue, something that deprives a lot of the characters of color. I think there is an optimum ratio of dialogue to narration that they preach in writing schools, but clearly Marquez is above those. Redundancy in the names of the characters greatly bottlenecks the fluidity of the texts. I kept wishing that he had named the characters uniquely because this style is not at all reader-friendly - and I don't care how illustrious and felicitated a writer you are supposed to be, it is just plain sadistic to foist that on unsuspecting readers. I guess I am not the first one to say that I had to keep reverting to the family tree to re-orient myself with the characters. It seems to be a signature of Marquez that his characters sexualities blossom pretty early. I read Love in the Time of Cholera some while back and this was the most disturbing of that book (okay aside from a senescent man's capering with a pre-pubescent child), until I realised it was a recurring feature in One Hundred Years too. I am still unsure if that's the magic or realism kicked in, or if I am just in a cultural warp. All that said, the reason I can't entirely trash the book is that Marquez's expressions and felicity with words in parts is exquisite. I am a sucker for masterstroke opening lines, and this book's opener will remain in my memory long after that of the characters has dissolved. So I do appreciate those vignettes of genius that emerge from what is otherwise an ordinary work that doesn't merit the rapture surrounding it."
2259,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A3UX9YA66ABVX,SalveteAmici@Eldish.Net,1/2,5.0,870998400,Unraveling the trail of clues,"One of the most compelling scenes in &quot;100 Years&quot; is Arcadio stuck against the wall, shot within Rebeca's horrified glance. Aureliano escapes by the intervention of Jose Arcadio, who in turn is shot by Rebeca. The trickle of blood has trailed in its seventeen-verb course through town to be discovered by Ursula just as she is about to separate the thirty-six eggs for the baking bread. Then Ursula like Theseus follows the trail in reverse, discovering both victim and murderer. As readers we too pursue a trail of clues to unravel the family saga.Both firing squad scenes form a gruesome irony on a potent symbol of Hispanic culture, the ubiquitous crucifix. Somehow I had not expected to witness, as reader, either of those scenes. It is almost a &quot;Ben Hur&quot; effect, that the witnessing of an execution sets one to thinking and in his case believing. On the other hand, Aureliano appears to be the main protagonist, and thus his death is hard to believe in, despite all the foretellings. Several of those little warnings deviate to the effect of &quot;years later, when he was an old man,&quot; so that his death by firing squad is incongruous. But other &quot;facts&quot; we accept have already been violated and therefore it is not impossible.There is something amusing about breaking oneself away from &quot;100 Years,&quot; ending at Ursula's comment upon getting a letter from Aureliano in Cuba that he will spend Christmas at &quot;the remote ends of the earth,&quot; to turn to Alexander Humboldt's real-life &quot;Voyage to the Equatorial Regions&quot; from the Canaries across the Atlantic to some of the very places (whichever they are) traversed by Aureliano. Indeed, &quot;100 Year&quot;'s insistence on anonymity of place (except for the obviously fictitious Macondo) implies its events can happen practically anywhere in South America. The not infrequent mention of the Caribbean, the seasonal rains and the tropical forests specifically suggest southern Venezuela or Brazil or anywhere within Garcia Marquez's Colombian homeland.Even so, we should not take geophysical signs too literally in this work. The very mixture of alleged facts allows us to conceive of a Pan American (or Pan South American) ethos, a world of chaos in which the whole world is one's own tiny village, in which one's life is but a process in an entire generation and an entire genealogy. In turn, the genealogy is played out in the entire lineage, each individual living out both the past and the future.Then, too, Garcia Marquez forces us to examine our own assumptions of reality and civilization, to examine microscopically every detail we consider normal and reassess it from every angle. What are familial relations? What is war? What is communication? What is love? What is peace? What is the development of a town? What is manly honor and womanly virtue? What is philosophy? What is a noble idea vs. a silly charlatanism?All these and more are facets of life that he turns upside down and inside out -- the priestly levitation is one of the more literal examples -- to reveal ever more intimacy of the individuals involved and ever more that makes us question our very selves. To read Garcia Marquez is to journey into the heart of oneself, even as Humboldt travels into the very geographical territory of Garcia Marquez. It is a fascinating quest, each author enriching the other and both enriching me. Garcia Marquez assembles such an oddball amalgam of verisimilitude in the details, while at the same time presenting such an outrageous sequence of events, that the whole notion of history and of fiction (as in Borges) is called into question.It is interesting to see how the people of Macondo hear war and rumors of war from all parts, how contradictory reports reach them, only to be reversed by even more mutually contradictory notices. All of that is so typical of a world without mass media, yet to turn on CNN and read a newspaper account or two creates the same chaos. The only difference is the quality of the presentation, the so-called reliability of the sources. It is just a game whose sophistication has been improved, not -- I think -- its essence.At the same time of the limited communication of Macondo, Humboldt reveals his marvel at the wonders of &quot;modern progress and civilization&quot; (c. 1800) that allow residents of the remotest pampas of Argentina to communicate via mail with their fellow espanoles in Mexico and Florida. Together, these two concepts of communication, occurring more or less simultaneously since the war in &quot;100 Years&quot; seems to happen just after the great south American revolutions, comprise a dramatic irony to the state of mail I find in today's Venezuela. To send a letter from Caracas to Punto Fijo (some 200 miles) sometimes takes thirty days, while in Humboldt's day a twice-monthly trip was made from Buenos Aires to Spain. In &quot;100 Years&quot; news often travels faster, but always with a question of reliability. The supreme irony is that all is already foretold, right back at home.This is a book I will read over and over again to savor the richness of its poetic tones and the multiple layers of ironic and dramatic richness. It is like an English trifle, to be visually admired as a whole then to be nibbled away at in bites, each time savoring a new flavor and an unexpected taste"

True, the writing is sometimes amusing and witty that I burst out laughing while reading it, like the feasting dual between Camila, 'the Elephant', and Aureliano Seguando. I also like how the author describe Ursula, the Matriah of the family, goes about as lucid as ever, even after she became blind, as she discovered every member of her family repeated the same path, same action and the same words at the same hour. It's only when they deviated from the meticulous routine did they run the risk of losing something. Quote: ""The search for lost things is hindered by routine habits and that is why it is so difficult to find them."" How true!Some sub story on the different members of the 6 generation family is just so incredulous. Remedio the beauty not only captivated men and eventually killed them, but her secnt lingered on wherever she had been. Then there is the fluttering yellow butterflies to signal the appearence of Mauricio Babilonia, and Fernanda, whoes father sent her children gifts of saint statues every Christmas, and whoes last gift is of himself in a coffin.The book starts with the marriage of two cousins, Ursula and Jose Arcadio Buendia, who close boodline marriage was a constant source of worry, for it was believed that the offspring may be born with a pig's tail. Cleverly, it ended with the birth of a son with a pig's tail, the result of an affair between 2 cousins six generations later.The book was difficult to read because the names of the offspring were repeated as they were named after their fathers. So in the book, there were 19 Aurelianos and 3 Arcadios in 2 generations. Luckily there was a family tree diagramm for readers to constantly refer to in case they got lost. The use of pronouns 'he' and 'she' even after 2 subjects was discussed also lead to some confusion, as i had to figure out which subject the author was referrring to.It is a clever book and only a genius of a writer could clearly articulate the different characters that make up this 6 generation family and the detailed relationship between each one."

Also, the sensuality of the latin novel is quite well represented in this book, though it main focus is far more broad than sensuality.

The novel doesn't present a bad story but it also doesn't tell a great one to justify its status as a modern classic. The opening line is truly brilliant but after that the plot goes off into a meandering pan-generational story about a family in a backward region of South America that didn't stimulate my interest very much. Maybe it illustrates how little truly goes on in this novel when I point out that my favorite part of this book came early on when a centuries-old Spanish helm was discovered in a creekbed. To say that a minor moment like that was the best one of an entire 120,000-word novel isn't that strong of an endorsement.I also have to say here, I hate it when ""discussion questions"" are printed in the back of a novel.

This is far from a difficult book as many here seem to think. All of the similar character names, did not confuse me but rather lent themselves well to the jocular & whimsical fast pace of the book. (The naming kind of reminded me of an old joke about Sam Frank & Frank Sam. The similar naming is deliberately confusing as the telling of the joke moves at a fast clip so that right at the point you're starting to say ""what the hell?"", you get hit with a punch line that makes you spit your cookies in laughter - if you recall it at all, the punch line was ""I left my harp in Sam Frank's Disco"".) To ""get"" this book, you have to sit back, relax and let it sweep you away. If you can manage that, it moves at a quick pace, is quite amusing and never confusing. Don't worry that you can't keep up with the character names. That's actually not important like it is in most novels. Though I don't profess to know the author's point in writing the book, the point I took away from it is that life is pretty much a crap-shoot and in the end, nothing really matters. So chill out and enjoy the ride as much as possible. This is now my favorite work of fiction, unseating my previous long-held favorite, To Kill a Mockingbird."

This is a beautifully written book that manages, as successfully as any other book has, to capture the enormous wealth and breadth of the human experience -- from one family (and one town)'s point of view. No book could ever encompass the entire human experience; but this book does a hell of a job, beginning with the founding of Macondo to its eventual obliteration(guess how many years later). One reviewer states that reading the book feels like reading Genesis from the Bible, and I think that's about right.To those of you who dislike/have trouble with ""magical realism,"" just relax. Yes, you'll have problems if you think literally but what are books for? What is fiction for? Fiction is MADE UP. Good grief. Pretend you're at a movie, suspend your disbelief and get into the beautiful writing and wit and humor. It's a difficult book at times and the fact that everyone has similar names is very annoying, but what rewarding book isn't challenging?After you read the book, find Marquez's short stories, some of which are about Macondo and flesh out some things that the book leaves out (e.g. Big Mama's Funeral Carnival).I don't like or watch Oprah, and her choosing of this book is a little disturbing because now she's plowing into the territory of books I not only can't sneer at but absolutely love.

I've read this book 3 times, every time more is unlocked and the seemingly random points of the book suddenly connect, and then they landslide into further amazing ideas and meanings, and I can honestly say that no book since the Bible has this many honest life lessons and profound meaning.No word is wasted, and every letter sets you one step closer to unlocking this treasure of a novel hidden at the center of a forest of imagery. I read this book for school, wrote an essay on it, discussed it with friends, and read it again, and then I was so fascinated with it that I read it again. The story is captivating, the cycles of life the handling of time are simply so profound I cannot believe that this all came from one man. I thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for writing quite possibly, my favorite novel of all time. I could only imagine it's brilliance in its native Spanish. Much like Naruda, each reading unlocks even more beautiful subtleties and spectacular connections to modern life.So, in conclusion, if you have any curiosity, entertain it and pick up this novel.

It's fiction, but it's a bit more than that. I remember reading somewhere that there is no difference between poetry or prose, fiction or nonfiction, that all these are just tools for writers to explain a truth. This book explains the truth in humans and everything from our vices to our virtues.The story also falls into a certain realm of fantasy because it does involve some supernatural elements such as ghosts and alchemy. It shows great men who lost their humanity, poor men who sold their souls for greed, the corruption of governments, the madness within ourselves, and the fallacy of our belief that people who are different than us are beneath us. The book follows an omniscient narrator as he tells the story of various family members of the Buendia family. Spanning several generations, these characters fill every quirk and vice that dogs humanity. My favorite character is Remedios the Beauty, who out of either extreme ignorance or extreme clarity is thought of as an eccentric, dumb girl. Her character poses the question, ""Is she really dumb or is she just smarter than us all?""The best books, though, are impossible to summarize and break down into succinct little paragraphs for those that haven't read it to truly understand. I plead that you read a few chapters into this book just to truly understand. More likely than not, if you prefer stuff by Stephen King or Dan Brown, you may not like this book. The book does not explain things point blank for you. It confuses you with over 30 characters, half of which have the same name. It melds storylines together from father, to son, to brother. It doesn't hold your hand and create suspense to draw your attention and it surely does not answer every question you have like a nurturing parent. It requires pensive thought while reading and an intuitive grasp of things deeper than what the author writes to truly understand. When you finish the book, there will be a myriad of questions left unanswered and you may or may not feel a certain disdain for the author for creating such questions within you. Answer them yourselves, the answer is in humanity."

The lively and eccentric characters like Jose Arcadio Buendia, the patriarch of the family, whose pursuits include getting a daguerreotype of God will make you laugh and make you think. Humorous incidents abound, including a supposed insomnia plague which causes the town to label every item in their house including the cow. Marquez's style is intoxicating and with every word he challenges the limits of reality and unearths the magical aspects of daily life. When Marquez describes carpets laden down with passengers flying through the air you simply accept an obviously impossible act as truth. The novel's length is somewhat daunting but very accessible. I would recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys fantasy or has an interest in Latin American culture. As the title suggests each character has his/her own private battle regarding the amount of solitude which is necessary and beneficial and amount that is overwhelming and debilitating. Sometimes the character's actions, like Rebecca eating earth and whitewash, seem absurd but Marquez always keeps in mind the nature of humanity and its varying inclinations.

Unfortunately I don't speak Spanish well enough to read this masterpiece in the original but I read it both in English and Russian translation and I would recommend it to any mature reader. An English speaker should only attempt to read this book if he is comfortable with other large foreign novels. If you can handle large works of Dostoevski (Dostoevsky) or Balzac in period translation, - cover to cover, - then go ahead. Otherwise don't even try to because what you'd be up against is pure torture. An abridged version of the novel or the same work narrated by a professional actor on audio tape could be considered a lighter cuisine but I am not familiar with either abridged version or the tapes. I guess people from nations which have had long periods of civil unrest and war on recent their historic consciousness could better relate to this work, its atmosphere and its characters than those who lack such experience or for whom it would be an extremely distant historic memory.

So I'll put it simply: As soon as 1999 comes around and we have to start reading everybody's top 5, top 10, top 100 lists, I'll sit down and make my own, but it will have to do only with books.

What a stunning masterpiece this is! I had read LOVE IN A TIME OF CHOLERA shortly after it appeared in English translation, and enjoyed it immensely, but as excellent as that was, it in no way prepared me for this amazing book. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's virtuosity is apparent on every page, assembling a vast array of improbable and unusual elements and blending them together to produce something utterly unique. He reminds me of those jugglers in a circus who spin plates on sticks, balancing them on every conceivable part of their body. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez brings in such disparate elements that one can't imagine that he will manage to be able to keep all his plates up in the air. Remarkably, he does.ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is the novel we most frequently associate with Magical Realism. It is impossible to think of this book without referring to ""magic,"" but the magic has as much to do with Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's astonishing mastery of his material as it does with the extraordinary events that occur in the novel. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have been a dreadful novel. Even a very good writer could be given a Cliff Notes summary of the book, and be asked to produce their own version, and produce a literary horror. The material is difficult, but Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez works it with a phenomenally deft touch, crafting it as superbly as Colonel Aureliano does his tiny gold fish. What is as unlikely is the way that he continuously introduces one supernatural element-a woman ascending to heaven while folding sheets, four years of rain followed by ten years of drought, a woman so sensual that her lovemaking causes livestock to reproduce at an usually fecund pace, a priest who levitates when drinking hot chocolate-after another without each new miracle seeming stale or losing its effect.The novel differs from most modern novels in that it does not contain in depth analyses of the characters. In fact, the characters aren't in general realistic characters at all. They function more like archetypes, and are sharply divided by gender. Men tend to act in the public arena, while women are guardians of the home and have it as their realm of influence. But not even the more fully drawn characters in the novel, such as Colonel Aureliano or his mother Ursula, emerge as full blown characters as in most serious novels in the 20th century. Nor is there a tightly constructed plot. Rather, the novel consists of a series of remarkable, fantastical collection of events and characters centered on a particular South American town. Some readers I know who want in depth, realistic characters have found the novel disappointing. But I have trouble accepting that a novel can take only one form.One could easily make the case that this is the most influential novel of the past forty years. It has had a profound influence not only in the Latin American world, but on writers in virtually every culture in the world. It has achieved a remarkable success in countries as disparate as Japan, Russia, the United States, and the various European nations. It is widely read in Africa and has been embraced in the Arab world as a modern day version of the Arabian Nights. The novel enjoys as close as one can find to universal appeal of any work of the past half century. My belief is that its success is merited and that it is one of the most remarkable novels that one can find."

More to this than meets the eye,"I am not what you can call the quintessential Classics aficionado, a couple of the books of that ilk I ventured into having bored me to death with their dreary dull plots, where 200 pages into the book you are still awaiting the drama to begin, and not having a clue of why on earth the man (or woman) in question does the things he is doing. Mostly the books I have enjoyed reading are the ones which had characters one could classify as human, earthy and realistic, the drama arising from the extraordinary situations they find themselves in. As such, the blurb on ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" (OHYS) should have ensured a quick rebuff on my part, what with its mythical town of Macondo, and a profusion of complex characters bearing confounding names living (and dying) in most surreal situations. OHYS is all that I have laboriously stayed away from - Gypsies and flying carpets, ghosts walking in and out at their own random free will, a torrential downpour which lasts more than 4 years, men and women locking themselves up for years together into the confines of their rooms - just to mention a few among the plethora of [...] things Marquez throws at you in wonderland Macondo. But once you sift through these seemingly inane and outlandish curios, what reveals is an intricate story of raw humans. OHYS lives up to its reputation of ""fecund, savage, irresistible ...characters rear up large and rippling with life.."" I don't yet make a claim to have discerned the more profound matters dwelled upon by the author, sufficient justice having been done to these by significantly more qualified people, but what I read is something I enjoyed tremendously. If not for anything else, this book is recommended just for Marquez's irreverent and comical treatment of all that we hold as fundamentals of life itself."

This is nothing less than the meaning of life, revealed through the virtues and faults of the Buendia family. The town of Macondo is a experiences everything of importance that has happened in the Americas since they were discovered by europeans.

Anthony,1/2,3.0,1308182400,Not My Favorite Work By This Author,"I recently read the author's acclaimed work ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" and enjoyed it very much. It spurred me to seek out more work by Marquez, hence this and several others that I recently purchased.Marquez's writing is certainly unique in its earthiness. He deals with such subjects as sex, bodily functions and graphic illness as if they are parts of everyday life ... because they are. It is refreshing. Marquez is also known as one of the leading practitioners of the literary device of ""magical realism"" in which events are introduced into the story which are quite fantastic (for example, a character being swept away into the sky as though taken to heaven, a rain event that lasts over four years followed by an absolute drought of ten years).At its heart, this is the story of a remote South American village, from its founding, growth, prosperity, decline and ultimately through its destruction, as seen through the prism of a single extended family. In something of an annoyance, the numerous generations of the family all have the same or very similar names and usually inhabit the same time frame. So, you might have three or four actors with virtually the same name inhabiting the stage at once. This can be very confusing, especially when resuming the story after a night's sleep. Luckily, the author includes a family tree in the front of the book, a page I visited with regularity.The author's writing is indisputably beautiful and at times mesmerizing. However, I must say that I enjoyed LitToC quite a bit more, simply because it actually contained what I found to be a haunting and compelling story. I felt that the writing here dragged at times, but that's just me, a philistine. In my world, beautiful writing, in and of itself, can only take you so far before you need an end to the means (at least I do)."

His style is very unique; it seems disjointed and jumbled at first glance, but as the reader continues everything falls into place.The imagery and metaphoric language throughout was especially fantastic. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has a way with words that makes you think. His use of magical realism is flawless. The book creates impossible situations throughout that for some reason seem plausible in relation to what is happening in the story. Some sentences are incredibly simple, and others may make you go back and reread. Magical realism can be very difficult to incorporate in a work of fiction properly, and I believe he has both produced a wonderful work of art and great instruction on how to do so in one sitting.If you've never read this book before, you owe it to yourself (if you're an avid reader) to check it out.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez forces his readers to pay attention wrapping his fantasy tales around deep and abiding characters it is sometimes very difficult to interpret where the story ends and the fairy tale begins. I found Marquez's writing style very difficult to read without having a few notes scribbled about me to refer back to. He has so many characters in the book, some with the same name, and bounces back and forth between decades that if you are an unorganized reader by page 50 you will already be lost. I am amazed at Marquez's ability to sustain his own thoughts during the writing of this novel. I found the women to be far more interesting than the men, each woman a central figure in family life as well as the most entertaining fantasies. You will be confused, uplifted, humored, informed, saddened and satisfied when you reach the end of this unique novel.I enjoyed this novel but did not find it to be the life sustaining recommendation that so many others insist it to be. So many literary professionals and celebrities have pumped this novel up to such great expectation that I would almost dare to say I was disappointed that I missed the affect it was supposed to carry. I imagine if this novel was read several times and studied with a fine toothed comb it may produce such elation.

I must admit, however, that I was a bit mystified by the novel at first. The books I read tend to fall into three classes. The first class of books are books I feel like I ""get"" right away on a first read through without having to read anything about them. The second class of books are books that I ""get"" to some degree, but I often feel like there is a lot I am missing, and I usually try to find some good books and articles to read that will help me figure out what I am missing. The third class of books are books that I enjoy, but ultimately feel like I am missing the main point. One Hundred Years of Solitude fell into that last category for me (if anyone is wondering why there is no fourth category of books I do not enjoy at all, it is because I almost never continue reading a book if I am not enjoying it).One Hundred Years of Solitude is not a difficult book by any means. Anyone can read it and will be capable of understanding the story and appreciating Gabriel Garcia Marquez' narrative techniques (his magical realism, and foreshadowing, for example). Gabriel Marquez is a beautiful writer, which comes across even in translation, and he tells a very interesting story, in a very unique way. That much is evident right away. But I think a lot of people who read this book will have the sense that there is more to the work that they are not getting despite its outward accessibility. I know I did. So I decided to do some research and it turns out I was right. There is a lot in this book, and there has been a lot written about this book, and while I have only read a small sliver of the available English language scholarship on this novel (if one includes Spanish language scholarship on the book I am sure the hills of material turn into mountains), the little that I have read has increased my appreciation for the novel a hundred fold. I am now sure that this will be a novel I continue to re-read and study throughout my life. So before I provide my own short interpretation of the novel (which is heavily indebted to essays I have read about the novel) I would like to recommend the works I found most helpful in unpacking some of the riches in this novel (I am sure there are more I have yet to discover).First, there is a collection of essays:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude: A Casebook (Casebooks in Criticism)edited by Gene H. Bell-Villada. The essay ""Gabriel Garcia Marquez: Cien anos de soledad"" by James Higgins serves as a particularly good general introduction to the novel. There is also another collection of essays I found helpful:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez: New Readings (Cambridge Iberian and Latin American Studies)edited by Bernard McGuirk and Richard Cardwell. There are two really excellent essays in that book on One Hundred Years of Solitude: ""Magical realism and the theme of incest in 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'"" by Edwin Williamson, and ""On 'magical' and social realism in Garcia Marquez"" by Gerald Martin. Those two essays totally transformed my interpretation of the novel. And finally there is a short book:Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude (Landmarks of World Literature)by Michael Wood. Michael Wood has a lot of interesting insights into the novel. I thought the sections where he discussed tone and narrative structure were particularly interesting, and those were aspects of the novel that did not get as much discussion in the other essays I recommended.Now, onto my synopsis and discussion of some of what I think are the most interesting themes of the novel. I should give my SPOILER ALERT at this point. I give away the ending of the novel, as well as a great deal of what happens in between, so if you have not read the novel yet, you probably should not read on. You have been warned!The novel, of course, tells the story of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo. The town is located in Colombia but as many interpreters of the novel point out, the setting ultimately serves as a universal representation of post-colonial Latin America. Macondo is, in other words, both specific and universal, at least universal within the context of Latin America. The novel encompasses roughly a hundred years, and I think six generations of the Buendia family, and within that time span the two major historical events are a Civil War, and the arrival, and eventual departure, of U.S. imperialism in the form of the Banana Company. These historical events provide the background for the events within the family (marriages, infidelities, feuds, suicides, murders, etc.).The story, of course, incorporates what has come to be known as 'magical realism'. Supernatural events are described in a very matter-of-fact manner, as if they were simply everyday occurrences (levitation, ascensions into heaven, magic carpets, raining flower petals, etc.). This technique certainly spices up the narrative, and has given rise to a number of conflicting interpretations in terms of its meaning (I will have more to say about this when I get to the themes of the novel). The novel also makes extensive use of foreshadowing, where events are described out of order. The narrative jumps ahead, and then moves back to catch up. It might seem like this would be a particularly ineffective narrative technique since the author is, in effect, giving away what is going to happen in advance, but it actually functions quite well, and ultimately produces some surprises by taking advantage of the readers' natural tendency to jump to conclusions. I will give one particular example from the first page of the novel (remember my SPOILER ALERT is in effect). The very first sentence of the novel is, ""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice"" (11). The reader, of course, jumps to the conclusion that Colonel Aurelian Buendia is eventually killed by firing squad, and yet, we are told much later in the book that Colonel Aureliano Buendia died of old age (104). And it is only later in the book still that the firing squad incident is actually narrated ""in the present"", and, of course, much later we discover how, and when, Colonel Aureliano Buendia actually dies. So despite the foreshadowing Gabriel Garcia Marquez is still able to keep the reader guessing about what is going to happen.There are really two main themes of the novel that I want to highlight. There are, of course, more than two themes in the novel. The theme of solitude is, obviously, central to the book, as the title suggests, but I don't feel like I really have a firm grasp on what Gabriel Garcia Marquez is trying to say about solitude, so I will not be discussing that theme in any detail. The two themes I find most interesting are: the meaning of 'magical realism', and the theme of time (or the meaning of history).In regards to 'magical realism' there have been a number of interpretations put forward by different scholars (I owe this little summary largely to the essay I referenced above by Edwin Williamson). The first group of scholars tend to see 'magical realism' as a means for creating a fully autonomous fictional universe, similar to the fictional universes created by Jorge Luis Borges in his fiction. The second group of scholars tend to see 'magical realism' as a means for critiquing the Western/European obsession with ""objective"" material reality, and its tendency to deny any reality to the narrative mythologies that actually tend to make up our life-world. The third group of scholars, represented by both Edwin Williamson and Gerald Martin, see 'magical realism' as a means for examining the relationship between consciousness and ideology, on the one hand, and objective/material history on the other. I tend to side with this third group. I think 'magical realism' is a brilliant technique for highlighting the separation between consciousness and historical reality.The actual history of Macondo is largely driven by external forces. The Republican period where the central government attempts to assert control over the largely independent municipalities ultimately leads to the conflict between Conservatives and Liberals and the Civil War, which has a dramatic effect on Macondo. The arrival of the fruit company, and U.S. imperialism, dramatically changes the shape of Macondo, so much so that when the fruit company finally leaves, Macondo is little more than a ghost town, and is ripe for the eventual apocalypse that will sweep it off the face of the earth. But the characters in the novel, as Gerald Martin persuasively argues, remain mostly unaware of these objective forces shaping their fate, and live within their own narratives, their own mythical understanding of their history. This ultimately leaves them powerless to shape their fate, and this powerlessness is perhaps why there is such a deeply pessimistic strain in Gabriel Garcia Marquez' vision of history. But is this powerlessness the final word? The novel seems to me to be arguing that it will be the final word as long as people continue to live in their own fantastical narratives about history (ideology in the Marxian sense). If, however, people wake up (as Jose Arcado begins to wake up in his labor struggles) then there is a possibility that this historical determinism might be overcome. The novel does not present the solution, but simply presents the problem. Anton Chekov once wrote to a fellow writer ""you confuse two things: solving a problem and stating a problem correctly. It is only the second that is obligatory for the artist."" I believe that Gabriel Garcia Marquez has, in this novel, stated the problem correctly, and he has, to that degree, fulfilled his function as an artist. The solution to the problem, if one exists, must be found in life itself.The other theme I found the most interesting was time. There are, ultimately two visions of time presented in the novel. A circular vision, and a linear vision. These two views of time are summed up beautifully in a symbol that appears late in the novel when Pilar Ternera, a fortune teller and occasional lover to the Buendias, has a realization, ""a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spinning into eternity were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle"" (364). This image combines both the circular view of history (the turning of the wheel) and the linear view (the wearing of the axle).The most obvious evidence of the circular view of history in the novel is in the often frustrating repetition of names. I think that every male in the entire Buendia family (and there are a lot of them) is named either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano. This illustrates that history may be progressive if conceived within the span of a single life, but if one widens one's view it becomes apparent that each generation is a repetition of all previous generations, and is condemned to repeat the same struggles as the last generation. The circular view is somewhat pessimistic, though I think there is a lot of truth to it. The pessimism can be seen in Colonel Aureliano Buendia's realization of the meaninglessness of his political struggles, and his decision to spend the last years of his life making little gold fishes just so that he can melt them down and continue remaking them over and over. This view of time could also be called the ""archetypal"" view, since it views history as the repetition of a limited number of archetypes (all the Aurelianos share certain characteristics, or are expressions of the same archetype, just as all of the Jose Arcadios are expressions of a different archetype). This is essentially the same view of history that one sees presented inFinnegans Wakeby James Joyce, in which every character is a repetition of a particular archetype that has been repeated throughout history since the beginning of time, ultimately going all the way back to Adam. I find this view of history quite compelling.The wearing of the axle, however, presents a more linear notion of time, though it seems to be associated with degeneration, as opposed to progress (both of the notions of time presented in the novel seem to be opposed to the most common Western European view of time as continual progress). This second notion of time is expressed, in the novel, through the degeneration of Macondo and its eventual collapse. The axle has finally broken and the wheel has fallen off. The repetitions are finally over. It is safe to say that both of Marquez' notions of time are fairly pessimistic.It is instructive, I think, to compare the view of time and history presented in the novel to that of the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. I just recently came across this interesting quote from Hegel'sIntroduction to the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, ""Even world-history is not like a romance; it is not a collection of accidental deeds and events; it is not accident which rules in it. The events in it are not the forays of knights-errant, not the deeds of heroes who knock about to no purpose, who toil and sacrifice themselves for some trivial thing"" (63). I think it is pretty safe to say that Hegel's view of history is, in many ways, the polar opposite of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' view, at least as presented in this book (I know very little about Marquez' personal opinions or philosophy). I think the view of history presented in this book is, precisely, a view where heroes ""knock about to no purpose"" and ""toil and sacrifice themselves for some trivial thing.""Colonel Aureliano Buendia, for example, while fighting his Civil War, is asked to compromise on some of the reforms the Liberals are demanding in order to gain wider popular support for the cause. The Colonel is told that this is a purely ""strategic decision"", but the Colonel rightly realizes that by going along with the compromises the war he is fighting essentially becomes a war over who is in power, and nothing else. In other words, it becomes a war between heroes who are fighting over some trivial thing. Anyone who thinks this is an unrealistic picture of history should check out the bookWinner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer--and Turned Its Back on the Middle Classby Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. There is a point in that book where the authors are describing the tactical decision made by the Democratic party to become more friendly towards business interests in response to the Republican parties superior ability to raise money. The thought occurred to me, as I was listening, ""If the Democratic party sacrifices its whole platform as a strategic decision to raise money, and ultimately win elections, then there is really no more difference between the two parties, and the candidates are not really fighting for anything other than power."" In other words, what is the point of winning a contest if one is forced to give up what one is fighting for in order to win? I had this thought before I read One Hundred Years of Solitude, and when I came across the passage where Colonel Aureliano Buendia came to his realization, it immediately reminded me of what I had read in Hacker and Pierson's book. This seems to me to be the way that history actually works, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez has diagnosed it brilliantly in this novel. Whether this pessimistic view is, or should be, the final word, I cannot say. But, like all good art, Marquez' novel provides not only entertainment, but genuine insight into the world we live in, as well as ourselves."

(Literal: No evil shall last 100 years; English: Nothing bad lasts forever.)1. Writing Style/ Readability: The writing style is what truly makes this a five star book to me. Not the plot or the characters or even the depth of it. Granted, the original was written in Spanish, but I don't think that too much was lost in translation. If I ever become fluent in Spanish (and I'm crazy about this beautiful language!), I'll happily read the original as well. Marquez's style (or the translator's, however you want to view it) is very smooth and enchanting, and appeals to my childlike fascination with anything magical. Oh, and there's actually a lot of humor in the book if you're paying attention.2. Plot - lots of interesting stuff going on, but there's not one ""true"" storyline to follow, as it seems like a never ending list of random happenings. Basically, you're following the lives of a family from generation to generation, getting to know each family member's personal story, some more than others. People die mysteriously or go insane every chapter or so, and it's tough to predict what's going to happen next. Marquez's foreshadowing at the beginning of the book is clever; he sneaks in lines about the far future to make you do a double take (""years later, when Aureliano faced the firing squad...""). The mystery of Melquiades is the common fragment that frames the entire story. I actually wasn't that impressed by the ending, but to each his own.3. Characters - let me just tell you right off that they're almost entirely unrelatable. They lack any real personality and I felt no emotional connection to them, especially since they tend to come and go in the story. (the exception of this being Ursula) However, I think this could also be viewed as an intentional exaggeration by the author...The only two ""real"" emotions that the Buendias have are lust and loneliness, which, in my opinion, are two of the strongest emotions that a human being can have. Lust is such a primal desire and it's obvious how much it still has hold of us even in this modern world. Loneliness is a more complex emotion, but I think that anyone can empathize with the conflicting feelings of wanting to be with someone so much, yet also being afraid of rejection.4. Overall Originality: Yes yes yes. That's all I'm going to say about that.5. Value (was it thought provoking): For me, personally? Not really. The ending, though, was a tad depressing in that it left me with the message of ""life is a cycle, we all die, everything you do is pointless"" which is why I tend to avoid books about philosophy because sometimes thinking too much about the universe makes me think as if there's nothing that truly matters because mattering is nothing after all. And now I've made myself depressed. Moving on.6. Enjoyment - this book was entertaining because of all its intricacies and twists and turns. It also really inspired me to write, which usually only happens when a book is fantastic or awful.The Bottom Line: read it because it's different from anything else you'll ever read"

2309,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A2LRVU5ZTGDKDB,Dan Lesnick,33/38,4.0,1177632000,Great novel with a few distractions.,"This novel grabbed me almost immediately, and I was sure it would not let go until I had finished it. Unfortunately, however, it did let go for a while, and even pushed me out sometimes.It begins beautifully with the founding of Macondo, and the visits of the gypsies to that small village. The introductory chapters are bright and uplifting. Unfortunately, near the middle of the book, it slows down tremendously and becomes largely mundane. Particularly when Marquez writes about the wars of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. During these parts, he seems to shift the tone of his writing, which is likely appropriate considering the shift in subject matter, but it just felt flat and dry compared to the beginning of the book. Fortunately, the rest of the novel after the accounts of the wars regains its earlier pace and style.My other complaint is that Marquez used his character names over and over again, and other than a small reference to the cycle of the family curse, there seemed to be little reason to burden the reader with so many Aureliano's and Jose Arcadio's. There was Jose Arcadio Buendia, (2)Jose Arcadio(s), Jose Arcadio Segundo, and Arcadio. Colonel Aureliano Buendia, Aureliano Jose, Aurelianos, Aureliano (x2), Aureliano Segundo, and even a reference to 17 of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's offspring all with the first name Aureliano, four of which are introduced as secondary characters. There is even a small amount of repetition in the female character's names. Whether this name game would have been plausible within the lives of the characters or not doesn't matter to me. I never felt that there was a compelling reason for Marquez to burden his readers with the trick.With those complaints aside, it is a great novel. Marquez conveys very well the loneliness felt by his characters. His characters are sometimes unaware of how lonely they are, but Marquez makes their solitude apparent to the reader. Several of the characters aren't fleshed out very well, but the book isn't as much about the characters as it is about the recurring theme of solitude that they experience.Definitely a novel worth reading to gain a feel for Marquez' mastery of written emotion, but be warned that it is easy to become frustratingly lost in the quagmire of repetitive names. (Fortunately, there is a simple family tree before the first chapter which helps to clear up some of the seemingly unnecessary confusion with the names.)"

Anybody that appreciates the magical story of Macondo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's work that much is allright by me!!This is my absolute favorite book ever!!. I grew up in a small fishermen village in Puerto Rico and reading this book taught me to appreciate the character of a town for its uniqueness and that no matter how obscure a life might seem, every life has a story to tell from where a lesson can be learn.

I now see why he won the Nobel prize for literature in 1982. I got so involved with the characters that I was actually dreaming of them (maybe hallucinating). I wanted to know why they behaved the way they did. Marquez had a systematic way of reavealing everything at the end. However, it was a little difficult to read, but challenging. It was funny,but at the same time weird. I loved reading it. Garcia Marquez has an incredible knack with words. Even though I read the English version of the book, I don't imagine much was left out as a result of its translation. He was able to show how individuals in this fictitious town, Macondo, become lost in their own worlds, desires (solitude) and at the same time disregard any social mores or laws and consequences. He subsequently showed that there are consequences for one's actions. Granted, there were many things that cannot be easily explained, but that is all part of his style of writing called &quot;Magical realism&quot;. I loved &quot;100 years of solitude&quot; so much that I intend to continue doing more research to understand the book. Great piece of literary work.

At that instant, I was carrying a book recommended by a friend of mine: One Hundred Years of Solitude. I had barely started to read it, and my father's friend told me that I would never read any book better than Garcia Marquez' initimate history of the Buendia family.And by golly, he was right. I heeded his advice and read the book in a harried daze while waiting in line for the rides at DisneyWorld and Epcot. And when I finished it, I was so amazed. I never knew that writing could be so dazzling, that a novel could be so endearing and challenging. In fact, this book made me fall in love with the delicate microcosms of novels, with the passion and power of words.And to this day, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been a steady and well-worn companion. I took the book with me to college, to law school, and even on trips to the Carribbean, South America and Mexico. In times of stress or hardship, I would read about Macondo and its generations of inhabitants, and suddenly be touched. I doubt if I will ever read a book again that has inspired, affected, even changed me as much as this book. The book and I are good friends; and as I sit and write this review, it sits there, on my bookshelf, its tattered and weatherbeaten spine enticing me once again: &quot;Read me, old friend.

They failed to find the ocean but built the town on the edge of a great swamp. The town grows and changes as time is transformed by modern inventions. The first of these inventions are brought by the gypsies, one of which was a heavy man with ""an untamed beard and sparrow hands"" who introduced himself as Melquiades. He sold Jose Arcadio Buendia a magnet and later a telescope. These items transformed Jose Arcadio Buendia from an industrious man who helped build the village into a man obsessed.Obsessions, solitude, love and war are themes of One Hundred Years of Solitude. Character after character seems to fall into one strange obsession after another. There is a girl who eats dirt to manage her pain, a man who loses his mind and is tied to a chestnut tree for years, a man who spends years writing on parchments and another man who spends years trying to decipher them.As Maconda is at first an isolated village, we see also that many of those living there have isolated themselves in one way or another and live in solitude. Indeed, solitude is a word which Garcia Marquez using frequently in the book. Aside from those characters who have locked themselves away physically are those who have removed themselves in other ways by rejecting love for fear of the transformative hurt which love can cause or by allowing war to take the place of love and human feeling.Gabriel Garcia Marquez wanted to tell the story in the way in which his grandmother told stories, with a granite face and a rambling way in which both listener and storyteller became lost in the story. He certainly accomplished this. At any point of the book the language and story telling is beautiful, but also is a twisting path in which the reader wonders both where are we going and where have we been?Because of this manner of ""story telling"" One Hundred Years of Solitude is a challenge to read, but well worth the effort with its tale rich with strange and magic characters, and mystical events."

Parallel to this is the colourful and bizarre story of its founding and chief family the Buendias. The novel is filled with particularly peculiar literary techniques. Marquez introduces the concept of 'Magical Realism', a feature of Latin American writing and culture, into this novel especially, and into all of his novels to some extent. 'Magical Realism' concerns seemingly incredible and fantastical events being described as if they were a perfectly normal everyday occurrence. Marquez wished to write a novel as his own Grandmother would have told a story-hence magical and inherently impossible events are recounted with unshakeable faith. Yet these events are often reflections of reality: for instance, when the workers union of the banana company organise a protest, the army open fire and slaughter thousands of people. Bizarrely, the next day the survivors have forgotten this event entirely. While this is indeed strange, Marquez likens this to the fact that, governments of South American countries have committed slaughter, yet withheld any knowledge of this from the public via manipulation of the media. Hence Marquez deploys political and human comment throughout the fantastical events of his work, using magical realism. Largely due to this technique the novel is a particularly enjoyable read: the incredible events keep one captivated, while the frequent and flagrant sex in the novel adds a touch of excitement and humanity to the work. Also, there is a constant repetition of events which seem extremely similar. Whilst there is a definite sense of linear time in the novel, a sense of history being almost circular is also apparent. Thus, personalities constantly repeat the experiences of earlier generations, though never in precisely the same way. This repetition imbues the novel with a strong sense of fate. For instance, once a person has been named then the major events of his or her life have already been pre-determined.The novel is extremely dense and the repetition of names can at times make for confusing reading. Yet each action is so perfectly ordered thematically, each fantastical event so subtely allegorical, that the novel requires, indeed demands a second or third reading, upon which it will impart much of its meaning.A massively important and enjoyable book, which everyone should own."

Like almost everything in his book, the statement should not be taken literally. Just as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis is not required to appreciate the Hebrew bible, this alternative bible begins to make some sense only when you get the metaphor. Everything is known because human nature is what it is. Because we are human, we make the same mistakes over and over. History repeats. And, it repeats. And, it repeats.Marquez's man-made bible history tells you that you do not need his or anyone's written history book to know that pre-historic mothers cried for their future warriors even as they nursed them. Marquez wants you to know that you don't need a bible or a crystal ball to tell you that tomorrow's righteous dads will again be sending their brave sons into some bloody conflict somewhere. Everything is known. The past, the present and the future, it's all known. Marquez lays it out for you in this bible. It's not an easy read. Despite brilliant uses of ironic humor, despite a masterful use of language---really more poetry than prose---, despite the occasional hints of hopefulness, the message comes through loud and clear: Life's a bitch and then you die; after that there is nothing.Now, go have a nice day."

First of all, many object to the immoral things described in the book (especially incest). I myself don't read exclusively books by authors whose morals I agree with, but I understand that can differ. That is not the case with the second possible reason for people disliking this novel, however - and the reason is: people try to find traditional characters and a traditional storyline in the book. That is, naturally, impossible, because Marquez is very much of a postmodernist - thus there are no characters you can 'care for' and no real plot to follow - because these things simply do not matter, they have little or nothing to do with the meaning, the essence of the book.The main character of modern novels is usually an individual who doesn't fit in with the world, and Marquez certainly stretches the concept of that - in this case, the individual is the whole family. It matters not what each of the characters says, feels or does, because all the events are not meant to illustrate the characters' life, but rather the whole family's life - that is emphasized by the fact the names in the family as well as whole scenes from the family history continuously repeat in the novel. Marquez destroys the barriers of time, no such thing exists for him, everything was meant to happen long before it happened and thus time has no meaning, he freely moves events and characters in time, it seems. In other words, the whole book is not a history of a family - it is a history of an individual, really (you can see the birth of the family, its childhood, youth etc. and then death) or - perhaps - even the whole civilization (many classical themes have been used - from the Bible, for example).Marquez's language is immensely interesting - it is lively and changes throughout the book. He is also extremely good at exploring seemingly insignificant details (they can usually be taken as symbols - for example, butterflies have long been considered the symbol of the short life of happiness). Another thing that cannot be left unmentioned is the truly mesmerizing way he merges the real with the unreal, thus rising a question - what IS real?I think 'One Hundred Years Of Solitude' is one of the most important novels in the history of literature. It is open to interpretations - and if you are willing to try, you will find very much in this book."

As the family expands however, and the years pass, this original drive is replaced by less noble ambitions. Jose Arcadio's heirs are gradually caught up by their weaknesses and relive the lives and mistakes of their ancestors.The novel would not have been such a masterpiece if Marquez had not employed a style that fitted perfectly with his goal--through magical realism, somewhat dispassionate and cyclical storytelling he manages to convey to the reader his main idea--that the life of the Buendias and Macondo and pretty much every human being in this world is full of tragedy and drama, hope and hapiness. It is the flow of life that makes Marquez characters stand out--yes, unknowingly they repeat the mistakes of their fathers and sometimes they recognize it, even if it is on their deathbed.

And, 'you can take your extra minute and shove it up your a$$' (said just before the 3,000 people were mowed down by the army).Pay attention to the surrealism, the oddities of the characters.

The term ""magic realism"" has been coined to describe it, but what Garcia Marquez does, is akin to what Kafka and Joyce have done, but in a style less concise than the former, and less abstract than the latter. He tells the fantastic tale of Macondo and the Buendia family in the most sober of styles, offering up surrealism as part family portrait and part Latin American history.The repetition of names serves as a device to hermetically seal off the Buendias from the rest of society, thus ensuring their solitude. It can be overwhelming at times, and I frequently had to refer to the family tree to get my bearings. Each member of the clan has unique strengths or attributes, as well as fatal flaws, that isolate them from others. The Buendias seem to be in constant struggle, either with themselves, with the rules of society, or with the natural world in the form of ants, scorpions, and torrential rains that last for almost 5 years. The alchemic quest, the transmutation of the dross into the sublime, seems to be a running theme.Garcia Marquez is very adept at descriptive imagery, but it seems overused at points. I never felt empathy with any character. There is a lack of pathos in this novel. Outrageous humor is in my opinion, one of the chief qualities of this novel, and probably it's greatest strength, more so to me than the surrealism and obvious symbolism."

But let me try.A statement of personal taste first. The label of ""magic realism"" is, to me, a positive lure, and is one of the reasons that I picked up this book. I have a great love of other writers, like Borges, who blur the lines of realism and fantasy and fable and metaphor. My favorite contemporary writer of all, Steven Millhauser, I would consider to be a ""magic realist"" even though I have not heard others use the term.On an intellectual level, Garcia Marquez's book has an obvious cohesion. It appears to mimic the great religious texts of old, such as the Book of Genesis. The town of Macondo, as the world in Genesis, is provided with a founding myth. Various fantastical things take place, the realistic superficial world uneasily overlays a magic-based otherworld; boys are born with pigtails, others are born with unnatural large genitalia, gypsies roll into town bearing every manner of magical device.And, as in Genesis, events pile upon events; just as in Genesis the reader is subjected to a never-ending series of ""begats,"" in Marquez's book, one is treated to an indistinguishable and never-ending list of people named Aureliano (and several other similarly overused names.) This is intentional, to confuse the reader, to cause them to wonder which Aureliano is doing what, and to contemplate how this world is often stuck in repeating the same comedies and tragedies over and over.Some things are uniquely Latin American in the tale; you can see in the book a certain fatalistic attitude towards the region's political troubles, the suggestion that there is little higher meaning in them, rather a culture that is doomed to repeat the same old stories until that world eventually dissolves.But here's the problem: it's really boring reading, and it lacks the spark of other magic realism. Quite willfully, the author never brings any personalities to life; they exist as archetypes, one-dimensional figures, actors in an endlessly recurring play. So too with the ""magic"" events; there is really very little magic in them, at least insofar as they inspire any sense of same in the reader.I finished the book having reached the conclusion that it should have been a short story, not a full-length novel. You get the sense later on that the author is simply going through the motions, having decided on his superstructure for the book, he executes it with little feeling of inspiration or concern for the emotive or sensory power of literature that attracts readers.Which is to say, if you find reading Genesis boring, with its endless ""begats,"" you will probably find this boring as well. It is a flat, mechanically generated place, an intellectual comment on the world rather than a compelling, enjoyable piece of literature.Some of the other comments here suggest that most people will dislike the book, but few will love it, even as they give it high ratings. I believe that to be fair; I have friends who enjoy the book. I found it labored and the reading of it laborious."

This book was suggested to me by my junior HS English teacher, and it took me about 1 week and a half to finish. Normally, I can finish a book within a day or two. The reading took me longer, not because it's a big book (it's not), but because it is very intense. One Hundred Years is a marvelous story about the Buend&iacute;a family, and their trials and tribulations. I remember this story so vividly because it's hard to forget. My favorite character was the family matriarch, Ursula. None of the other female characters, in my opinion, could hold a candle to her. Whether she was taking care of poor senile Jose, or dealing with the pain of losing sons and grandsons, or even dealing with (in her old age) the bugs and plants her great-great grandchildren piled on her, she was a rascally character I couldn't help but admire.The ending was very different from anything I could have predicted, but in hindsight, the ending looks inevitable. It's a twist, a very different ending, then what most people are used to, and Marquez tells the story so fluidly, I think many are disappointed or even frustrated by the end. All in all, I think One Hundred Years is a terrific book club book, because this book needs to be shared and discussed."

The characters were unique and colorful and I enjoyed traveling the generations of the family and sharing their experiences.However, someone in each generation (and sometimes more than one person) was named a variant of Aureliano or Jose. I was constantly confused at which character experienced what and feeling as if the plot was contradicting itself. I continually flipped back and forth with the family tree provided at the beginning of the book which caused me to feel disconnected from the story. I would lose track of the plot and ended up rereading many sections multiple times.Eventually, I felt like reading the book was a chore, and I'll admit, I was relieved when I finally finished it."

I could accept that magic realism makes things that could never happen, happen. But it was the flow of the book that I had a hard time with.Some tips: You'll need to pay attention to every word on your page. If you zone out for one moment, you'll surely miss something. Make sure you read the book with the family tree in the front- I used it probably just about every chapter. It's hard when everyone's names are the same or similar. Also, stick with it.

One Hundred Years of Solitude is the third book by Marquez that I have read. The first Marquez book I picked up was Love in the Time of Cholera and I was blown away by the story and the remarkable and beautiful prose. Next, I picked up a small novel of Marquez's, Memories of My Melancholy Whores, and once again walked away delighted. I found that Marquez had a very unique ability to create emotional ties to the characters in his stories. I also found that I was reveling in the joys of those characters, as well as suffering their grief. Unfortunately, in One Hundred Years of Solitude, I never made those emotional connections.One Hundred Years of Solitude is a novel that is ostensibly about a family, the Beundias, and the lot they drew which apparently leads to eternal suffering and misery for everyone in the family. As compelling as that theme should be, I found that deep down, the story was simply about a town, Macondo and the suffering is tangential and always on the periphery.Marquez does tell the reader that the characters are suffering, and he does so with vivid language:""The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the years eroded her...""""He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in war because one was enough: fear...""""Rebeca, who had needed many years of suffering and misery in order to attain the privileges of solitude...""These are all beautiful descriptions of grief and torment; however, over the course of the novel, each set of characters is replaced about every thirty pages. No relationships or attachments are formed between the reader and the character. So, while I can see the pain and suffering, I can read the eloquent descriptions, I could not feel the emotion.The disconnect I felt while reading One Hundred Years of Solitude made finishing the novel a chore. The disconnect, along with frustration, grew with the passing of each set of characters. I found myself not really caring how Marquez wrapped up the end of the book, as long as the book ended. Therefore, I found the story had no climax, no central moment, no real theme other than ""suffering exists"".I was once told that if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all. Well, I may have broken that rule, but, I will stop here so that I avoid digressing and letting my frustration show anymore than I already have.For more reviews and suggestions, please visit: [...]"

Jones III,1/1,5.0,1296777600,All in the family...,"I first read ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" not long after it was first published in English, almost 40 years ago. It was a wonderful, and magically, if you will, introduction to Latin American literature. Subsequently, I've read several other works by Marquez, notably,Love in the Time of Cholera (Vintage International)some 20 years later, but none have quite cast the spell of my first ""love,"" this one, so I figured a re-read was in order. The ""magic"" of magic realism has lost none of its charm.The story involves six generations of one family, established by Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula Iguaran, who also helped found the town of Macondo, in the lowlands of Columbia, though the country is never specifically identified. The in-breeding (and also out-breeding) in this one family is simply astonishing. I can't remember if the original edition had a genealogical chart at the beginning, but this one does, and it provides an invaluable reference in keeping the philanderings, and the subsequent progeny, straight, particularly since numerous individuals over the generations have the same name. What is the ""Scarlet Letter"" that is prophesized for a family with such a high degree of consanguinity? That a child will be born with a pig's tail.Marquez dazzles the reader with the intensity of his writing; it's as though he had a 1600 page book in him, but is given a 400 page limit. It is the furious sketching of a street artist, making every line count in a portrait. The strengths, follies, and interactions of the men and women are depicted in memorable events. And there seems to be a realistic balance and development of his characters. Marquez is also the master of segue, from one event to the other, and from one generation to another, with his characters moving from swaddling clothes, on to adulthood, and then into their decrepitude.From my first reading, I had remembered Rebeca, with her ""shameful"" addiction to eating dirt. First time around, I chalked it up to Marquez's ""magical realism,"" since no one really ate dirt. Several years later I learned that it is a wide-spread medical problem, often driven by a mineral deficiency that the person is trying to remediate. The author also describes the disease of insomnia which was spread to Macondo, with an accompanying plague of forgetfulness. Magical realism, or the forgetfulness of the ""now"" generation that has lost the stories of the past?Establishing the time period comes slowly. Marquez mentions Sir Frances Drake, but he is in the unspecified past. It is only when a family portrait is taken, as a daguerreotype photo, that one realizes it must be in the 1840's-50's, with six generations to go. There are a multitude of themes: since this IS Latin America, Marquez has the obligatory gringos and their banana plantations (alas, all too true); there is endless, senseless war, with the two sides eventually unable to state what they are fighting for, except, of course, the war itself; there are the women who drive men crazy with their beauty, and there is the spitefulness of women to each other (alas, again, the ""sisterhood'); there is economic development, and a worker's revolt, and the use of other members of the same class, but in uniform, who repress it; there is the role of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and even a family member who would be Pope and there are unflinching portrayals of the aging process, alas, to the third power.On the re-read, I noticed a portion of the novel that was much further developed inInnocent Erendira: and Other Stories (Perennial Classics). Also nestled in the book was an important reference: ""Taken among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, a colonel in the Mexican revolution, exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been witness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz."" Checking Marquez bio, he has been a long-time friend of Carlos Fuentes, slipped this reference in 100 years, which is an omen for me, since I was considering re-reading Fuentes marvelousThe Death of Artemio Cruz: A Novel (FSG Classics)And in terms of omens, redux even, do future travel plans include meeting another character in the book, the Queen of Madagascar?I recently had dinner with a woman who had been Ambassador to one of the Latin American countries. Spanish is her native language, and she still reads some of the Latin American writers in Spanish to ""keep her language skills up."" As for ""100 years,"" she had read it four times, each time in English. It's a record I am unlikely to repeat, but this novel, which honors the Nobel Prize with its name, could use a third read, if I am granted enough time. It ages well, sans decrepitude, and provided much more meaning the second time around. 6-stars."

I think he tells us how our remorse, scars, pride, fear, resignation and forgetfulness lead us to live and die in solitude, even in the sea of humanity, and that such lives are, in the end, as if not having been lived at all, for they will not be remembered.For all of the numerous people who populate the story, the character development is deep and wholly convincing of each joy and suffering, of which the ups and downs are considerable as the tale unfolds. The story is told with a mixture of honesty toward the brutality of Columbian national life, rich fables and superstitions of the locality, and Sr. Marquez's own twists of imagination that immensely enrich the experience. The underlining profound themes and the overarching sadness of the story is sprinkled with laugh-out-loud humors and brilliant observations of subtleties of life that reminded me of Milan Kundera, though the context is obviously a world apart.This is one of those stories that, having read, one feels rather exhausted from the emotional upheavals, and needs some time to let it ferment a little. After a while it starts to emit an aroma that challenges one's conscience with the relevance of what was said. It's a story-telling at its best from a Columbian national treasure.

I was surprised to read reviews where readers considered the book &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;dense&quot; until I read parts of it in English. I've read this book several times in Spanish, which is my native language, starting from when I was 16. And I find that the prose is not dense at all. My criticism of this English translation is that it overemphasizes the &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; aspect of the language, making it almost self conscious of its own &quot;magical realism&quot;. I think that in Spanish, the magical realism is implied in the language, in the story. It feels like the English translation is intentionally dreamy, almost forced. Anyway, I think this is an excellent book in whatever language you choose to read it. Everyone should read this book at least once, don't worry about the hype, the analysis, etc. Just enjoy it, it will be worth your while."

Even though I agree that Marques does earn the Nobel Prize, the structure of the book itself is still complicated. One of the pains during reading this book is to follow the history of the generations. Once you read the family tree in the front of the book, you&iexcl;ll realize that the entire Buendia family shares the same name, either Jose or Aureliano. Another Obstacle that I have to overcome with while reading this book is try to follow the generations. For example, the writer might be talking about the 2nd generation in the Buendia family, then suddenly jumps into the 1st family to talk about the history. By having the same names, it really did make me read this entire book two times to understand it.The book itself should be categorized into the magic realism category. When I first read this book, I couldn&iexcl;t understand how its magic realism is shown, but later on in the book, it still eventually made sense. The first part of the book is basically introducing the family of Buendia to the readers, then it goes on with how the Buendia family experiences events that they had never experienced.

As the book goes on, we're exposed to Marquez's own sense of magical realism as he describes both the significant and trivial events in the lives of the Buendias.At times, this book seems to be going in every direction at the same time. It is difficult to remember the different characters and their relationships to one another. However, the beauty of this book lies in its language and its explanations for human action. Marquez attempts to paint hundreds of little pictures that ultimately sum together to describe all humans to some extent.His characters unrealistically engage in a type of symbolism to show different aspects of their inner workings. For example, Amaranta Ursula keeps her husband, Gaston, on a leash. This is Marquez trying to show us a side of Amaranta's personality and soul without coming right out and telling us. The book is full of examples such as these. If you are enchanted by clever symbolism done up in a magical realism form, you will enjoy this book.Ultimately, the ending really ties everything together SO perfectly. My mind was desperate for clarity by the end, and Marquez more than impressed me. The theme of this book is the human relationship to time. Marquez sums this book up best when he concludes, ""Melquiades (who I believe is supposed to be Marquez) had not put events in the order of man's conventional time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one instant."" - overall, an awesomely poignant work."

It's difficult, confusing, strongly metaphorical, and far more concerned with history and message than any deep look at its characters. At the same time, it is sometimes lyrical, beautiful, inventive, and given to unexpected trips to the magical, just when it seems bogged down in a very harsh reality.It's the story of the town of Macondo and the family that help found the town, stretched over the hundred years of the title. It's clear, when you step back from the details of this work, that the entire work is a metaphor for what happened to Columbia, from its early run-in with the Spanish invaders through the exploitive actions of companies out to rip the riches from the country with no regard for the human cost of their endeavors, and on into to the modern day world of political corruption backed by barely sheathed threats of force.The family that the book follows is unique in many ways, peopled by characters both incredibly strong and driven by obsessions, and yet insular, separated from the real world by their own internal fantasies. Here we find the rebel hero and the dominating matron side by side with ghosts, the Wandering Jew, and highly mysterious gypsies. However, all of these characters are seen from a distance, even though we are privy to their internal thoughts and ideas, and it is difficult to get emotionally involved with any of them. Not helping in this regard is the extreme similarity of names through various generations of the family, and frequent references to the genealogical chart at the beginning of the book are necessary to try and keep everything straight.Stylistically, be prepared for page long sentences and sudden multi-page discourses not immediately connected to current happenings. Often this prose is quite beautiful, and at times very effective in painting pictures of some very horrible occurrences in ways that can sear into your brain. Also be fully prepared for the flights of magical realism, when you go from the mundane of everyday to things clearly impossible in ordinary life, items which often highlight by contrast the depth and trivialness of the ordinary.If you are looking for a straightforward story with normal people, this is not the place to look. If instead you are looking for something very much out of the ordinary, and willing to work to find the core of what's happening, this work can be quite rewarding. It's doubtful if a single reading of this work will expose all of its potential, there is too much buried meaning, symbolism, and metaphor here that needs careful inspection to yield its full treasure. Its themes are not uplifting; futility, the constant of man's inhumanity to others is stark, the repetitiveness of the actions and character types from one generation to the next leads one down the path of asking what purpose does anything have, and the pervasiveness of each individual's necessary isolation from others keeps a dark cloud over the entire work. This is a somber work, with its gold carefully buried, and the reader must be a diligent prospector.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"

2383,B000I3JBUO,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,A2NHD7LUXVGTD3,doc peterson,6/9,2.0,1249862400,Terribly frustrating,"Given the lavish praise for _100 Years of Solitude_, I am gravely disappointed and frustrated. At the risk of being burned in effigy (or in the very least pilloried as a philistine), wading through Marquez was a real test of my patience and literary fortitude.The story was a difficult read, which I don't mind, so long as there is a reward for my efforts. I found no such relief here. Stylisitically it was an abomination: paragraphs that run one, two, two and a half pages long?! This was worse than Faulkner, as at least with him there is conflict (and resolution) in his writing. In _100 Years of Solitude_, the initial investment of 100 pages is that the following 300 pages are more or less a rehash of the first quarter of the book. The characters have almost identical names, and make many of the same decisions and actions as their namesakes. Beyond being repetitive, I found it mindnumbingly dull. Adding to the sense of drugery I experienced, was the geologic pace of the book.To be fair to the legions of fans of Marquez, I ""get"" magical realism - in fact, I enjoyed elements of it here. I also understand his point that history is ""cyclical"" (although I don't happen to agree with him on this), and that this explains not only the similarities in name but also in behaviour by his characters. A strong case could be made for Jung's ""collective memory"" in the book, given the actions (and in several cases, literal ""hereditary memory"") of the many Arcadios and Aurielianos ; heck, I can even see how one could argue that Marquez is showing the existential crisis of the individual - that, in spite of our best efforts, we are all alone, daily wrestling with our solitude. And perhaps it is precisely because of these clues that this is so beloved by so many. All that aside, I didn't enjoy the book at all and had to force myself to return to it again and again in order to finish. With his book, at least, I am puzzled at the high regard with which it is held."

And it's also an incredible read. Garcia Marquez has somehow managed to balance an absolute clarity of symbolic thought with a kind of earthy pragmatism, the like of which I have not yet found. There's none of that stylish European existential angst in here; the kind which appears in, for example, Waiting for Godot (another work I adore, at least on an intellectual level). In this I think there's an important message to be found: when you get done reading this book, don't just sit on your butt and muse on the glories of the written word -- go out and DO something! Write a book of your own, compose some poetry, fall in love, what have you ... just alleviate that solitude, any way you can! In that alone, he already takes a more active role than most important authors in pushing for an active participation in society, as opposed to the kind of hermetic isolation from which so many of us suffer today.Additionally, for all the hullabaloo about Magic Realism, there's really nothing to fear; everything that happens within the book is completely consistent with what Garcia Marquez would have us believe about the world of Macondo and the Buendias (the main family of protagonists in the novel, if you haven't read it). And I believe that a mutual coherence between all the internal elements of a work of literature is far more important than its being consistent with what we're used to reading. And frankly, I found it hilarious. Cheesy justification aside, Garcia Marquez is a master of comic timing, and wit spills out of the sides of this magically realistic book as copiously as does significance.In any case, this book is just a perfect balance of everything that I wanted in literature but was never able to find -- clarity of thought without loss of depth, a philosophical bent without a loss of a sense of reality, and an absolute mastery of the use of symbolism. This last point is perhaps the most significant; not a single word in the book is wasted. While it is possible to enjoy the book without thinking about it too hard, almost every sentence contains some metaphorical double-entendre -- some easy to spot, some more difficult.Yada yada. Anyway, this book is absolutely wonderful, and there's no excuse (that I can think up) for avoiding this book besides an utter distaste for everything written in the 20th century. Or maybe a chronic lack of time in which to read. I hope this review bumps it back up to five stars on the rating meter; it was at four and a half, and that's just not fair. Well, now I will stop blathering."

Hayes,258/270,5.0,973814400,Mesmerizing and Marvelous,"There are relatively few books that I've had to read for my college classes and truly enjoyed. This was one of them.Now, be warned: this is not a clear-cut story; the prose can be confusing, and the repetition of names makes it more difficult by far to keep track of who is who. The novel does indeed cover one hundred years, so expect to see favorite characters die if they first appear early on. There is no one protagonist. The family is the protagonist--the family, and the town.Perhaps despite these potential confusions and perhaps because of them, Marquez has woven in this book a shroud of mysteriousness and magical realism that make reading it something like stepping into a dream; his Macondo is like nowhere else on Earth (or at least nowhere I have ever heard of), and things at once comic, tragic, and unreal can happen there. You will find dreamers and would-be scientists, layabouts and soldiers, matriarchs and wantons in this enchanted household. Enchantment of a murky sort hovers over the land like a haze, touching everything and separating the descendants of Jose Arcadio from the world as we know it.You may not want to read it in one sitting; you may find yourself putting it down for awhile, confused or exasperated by the latest turn of events, but it is quite likely that you will pick it up again in due course with curiosity drawing you back into the realm Marquez has created.

It almost reminds me of watching a Tim Burton movie ( I had just seen Big Fish) with much more detail and story weaving. Sometimes you don't know when reality starts and stops, but that is also the beauty of this story. So many characters were living in their minds and not in the present.

That Tolkien could write a children's story with such depth and resonance that anyone from 3 to 300 can read and enjoy is beyond nearly any other writer's ability, at least in this genre. The Hobbit stands alone as a beautifully written tale, but that it left so many tiny cracks that Tolkien could create an epic sequel and a complete land (With amazing history!) is beyond me. The Hobbit deserves reading once for entertainment, twice for discovery, and unlimited re-readings to delve again and again into a world that, beneath the magic, isn't unlike our own."

Since it was shot in New Zealand I got to see a lot of the country's scenery as well as enjoying a masterpiece of film. When reading a copy of Tolkien's original work sometime later I read ""Fellowship of the Ring"" all the way through but something about Tolkien's writing style caused me to lose interest after I started ""The Two Towers"". The fact I'd seen the movies was likely the reason, since I knew how the story went. After reading ""The Hobbit"" I might have to read ""Lord of the Rings"" in its entirety to see the differences between Tolkien's work and the Peter Jackson films (I'm sure both Tolkien's and Jackson's work are masterpieces of literature/film).While reading ""The Hobbit"" I could see/hear in my mind the faces/voices of Ian McKellan, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm and Andy Serkis (who played Gandalf, Elrond, Bilbo, and Gollum, respectively, in the films). I heard these actors had agreed to reprice their roles from Lord of the Rings one more time for ""The Hobbit"" (not sure about Ian Holm). It's too bad about the rights to a ""Hobbit"" movie remaining in legal limbo, but Tolkien's work is a literary masterpiece and I'm so happy I finally read it."

Wilfong,1/1,5.0,1356566400,Adventures!,"I recently read ""The Hobbit"" for only the second time in my life, and I have to argue with the people who say this is a children's book. I disagree wholeheartedly. Although there are elements of children's fantasy tales in the text, the themes and actions of ""The Hobbit"" are much more oriented to adults.I won't waste time rehashing plot points with this iconic text; instead I will focus on some features that stuck out to me.First off, if one is familiar with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I think their reading of ""The Hobbit"" will yield some interesting insights and they will catch some details that people not familiar with LOTR would miss. One can read, and greatly enjoy, ""The Hobbit"" as a standalone text, but I think it is much better when considered within the framework of LOTR.Another observation that surprised me was just how unlikeable the dwarves are in this book. Tolkien frequently mentions in his other works that dwarves are foolish and selfish, and usually only do good works when prompted by circumstance, but on this reading of ""The Hobbit"" they greatly annoyed me. Perhaps because of how much they remind me of most of humanity. And maybe that was Tolkien's intent? An allegory for how humanity often only makes the right choice when goaded into it, as opposed to it being our first and natural instinct.Although there are moments in the text that are a little slow going, they are few and far between, and Tolkien focuses much less on the minutia of detail about Middle Earth in this book as opposed to some of his others. I had also forgotten how action packed the last 100 pages or so of ""The Hobbit"" are. I was recently arguing with a friend that the decision to make the films of ""The Hobbit"" a trilogy was just greed as the book could not support 3 films. I was wrong, if the movies are well done, there is more than enough in this text to justify three films.This rereading of ""The Hobbit"" has made me want to jump back into Middle Earth, and I sense that I will be picking up and rereading more of Tolkien in the very near future. As for ""The Hobbit"", I will gladly revisit Bilbo Baggins and his adventures again and again over the course of my lifetime. No greater praise can one give a book."

One of The Hobbit's greatest aspects (or worst, depending on how you see it) are the vivid details of the scenery Tolkien provides the reader. This makes the reader feel as if he/she is in Middle-Earth as part of the party of 13 dwarves, one hobbit and a wizard. You experience everything the group does, and they do go through a lot. The downfall of this style is it may seem slow and boring to some, but not to me.Some say that there is not enough charcter development or that the plot is too thin. I beg to disagree. While there are many pages of wandering around Middle-Earth and descriptions of its locales, the plot moves at a fair pace with a main event present in every chapter. As for those who say that character development is non-existant in the novel must have skipped quite a few chapters. Do they not realise that the main character, Bilbo Baggins, goes through a tremendous change? At the very beginning of the book he has very little desire for adventure. He does not think of himself as brave or bold or resourceful. By the final pages of The Hobbit, he has become all the things he didn't believe he was.After reading this tale of travel and adventure, I now agree with those who say that this is the greatest literary works of the century. If you are open-minded and like fantasy in general or like the Star Wars saga, you should look into this book. And if you enjoyed reading this book you will also enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Finally, this is a great novel that is well worth your money, every cent of it."

Perhaps it is because I read it as a child, and it first introduced me to dwarves and elves in a way far different from their Disney counterparts. Perhaps it was the humanity of characters laid out for me to see. I am not sure exactly what it was, but after rereading it for the upteenth time, it still has not lost a smidgen of its charm.Sure, Lord of the Rings is the serious book, the more adultish, more classic quest fantasy to save the world from mortal peril sort of thing. The Hobbit is more of a quest to save Bilbo from living his life without a single thing happening that was unexpected. I think this central difference, combined with a younger target audience for this book, makes this book have a much more carefree attitude, and a generally much more merry tale.The pace of the Hobbit is pretty rapid, since really the journey of this story would have been of a similar length as Lord of the Rings, with a lot of detail simply missing from this book. The first leg of the journey was almost identical to Frodo's in route at least, yet it is over in a couple of chapters. Really, the lesser significance of this quest required a lot less development early on.What you really do see happen in the Hobbit, which is nearly absent in Lord of the Rings, is how a bit of a fussy homebody is changed into a daring and wise companion by means of the journey. Bilbo proved to be the lucky 'fourteenth' man on the quests of the dwarf Thorin to reclaim his homeland and treasure, and that was lucky for not only the dwarves, but for Bilbo himself. Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better. You can always just skip them, like I did when I was a kid.Highly recommended."

In the beginning of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins hated the idea of adventure, but he could only do so much to stop this one when thirteen dwarves and one wizard came to his little hobbit-hole in the hill.The lot of them needed his services as a burglar to gain their treasure back from he dragon, Smaug. He hesitantly agreed to go, and on the way, the group found Bilbo to be very handy, noble, and adventurous. Though the one to actually kill the dragon was a warrior from Dale, Bilbo played a large part in the entirety of the greater peace found after Smaug's death in the lands around. I strongly recommend this book to adventure-lovers and those in need of some inspiration.One reason that I liked this book was that it had many points of great suspense, such as when Bilbo woke up to find a giant spider's eyes and legs tying his legs together to eat him. Bilbo luckily woke up in time to kill the spider. Also, when Bilbo and his friends had to fight off the trolls, it seemed possible that Bilbo would get his toes singed, or they would all get eaten. It was a point of great suspense when Bilbo darted invisibly from tree to tree, away from the spiders who were trying ton eat him and his friends, who were hanging from a web some way off.Another good part of this book was the mystery that loomed in the background, though sometimes it was unnoticed until it was directly brought up. For example, when Thorin was lost from the group, it was quite unknown where he had gone, and it wasn't brought up for quite a while. Also, it was a mystery how Bilbo would get into his barrel, which he didn't get to, because he didn't think of it, but ended up floating down the river on top of it. It was quite a mystery how they would get out of the trees surrounded by wargs and goblins, but were eventually saved by eagles.My favorite part of this book was the way it often made it seem impossible for the dwarves and Bilbo to go any further, like when they were in the Goblin's passages, in front of the Great Goblin, about to be eaten, or when they got caught in the forest with no idea of how to get out. The best example was when they got stuck in the elven-palace, guarded by elves and a spell-ridden gate.The Hobbit was a very satisfactory reads, full of suspense, adventure, and friendship. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book that keeps you turning the pages through Bilbo's adventure.-K.Carson"

Tolkien wrote the book was for his own children to enjoy, but the intended audience of this book could be anywhere from 13 up to adults, as I know a 30 year old who claims to have read it 5 times and as recently as last year. Because of how well the book was written and the great characters, this is a great book for someone of any age to read.The only background information you need to know about this book is that it is a prequel to the Lord of The Rings series. I do not have many criterions to judge this book as it is the first one I have ever read from cover to cover. To summarize the book, Bilbo is convinced to go with a large pack of Dwarves as a thief to help them get their mountain back from an evil dragon called Smaug. Along the way they run into trolls, elves, spiders, goblins, eagles, and participate in a huge battle.I really enjoyed all of the books key elements. The plot really worked well for someone my age, it had a great reward at the end of all their hard work, and it had some amazing characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. It had sad parts too at the end where a main character learned a good life lesson. Knowing that this book was wrote before the Lord of The Rings I think it sets up that book really well. It already lets you meet a few of the main characters and makes you interested to see what happens to Bilbo and his ring. I haven't read any other books like this so it makes it hard to compare to books like it, but I know that I would be interested in reading more books like it if there any.The great characters and the adventure in this book really have made it an enjoyment to read. From the very beginning of being introduced to Bilbo and all his adventures with trying to escape being eaten by trolls, trying to get out of a goblin cave, being chased by wolves and spiders, and helping the dwarves escape from an Elvish prison along with trying to defeat a dragon and survive a war I really had a great time reading it.

Bilbo obliged and accompanied the band of dwarves on their rescue mission. On many occasions during his journey, Bilbo wished that he were back home, but once his duty was complete, Bilbo never regretted going with the dwarves.With an unexpected ending and great descriptions, I would undoubtedly recommend this book.

2437,B000NWU3I4,"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.",,,,0/0,5.0,928886400,The best fantasy book by the best fantasy author ever!,"The main character in the book The Hobbit is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A Hobbit is a short dwarf-like creature that really is not very capable of action. Bilbo was one of these exceptions, since he was born from a very famous family of Hobbit who were always getting into trouble. Bilbo's personality changes throughout the story. It starts like a regular Hobbit who doesn't want a adventure, but he eventually becomes sort of a leader and slays a huge dragon. The story The Hobbit didn't have any real defined point in history, but it did take place around fantasy times around spring. In the beginning of the story, Bilbo was in his little Hobbit hole when a group of travelers stop by to rest. It turns out they were on a voyage with a great wizard named, Gandalf. Through some means, Bilbo comes with them and meets their first challenge with a bunch of giants. The giants desperately needed food, and were happy to see these travelers until they all got away. The travelers faced a few more problems like goblins, until they were separated in a cave. Bilbo went downwards where he found this strange ring and met a strange monster. Bilbo discovered his ring made him invisible, and decided to make a deal with the creature. The creature was hungry, so Bilbo said that if he lost at a competition, the creature could eat him. If Bilbo won though, the creature would show him the way out. They decided to tell riddles, and by slightly cheating, Bilbo won and escaped. After Bilbo was reunited with his team, they voyages on, fighting more goblins and giant spiders until the final showdown with Smog the dragon. Everyone was too scared to face him except Bilbo. The dragon was so large he couldn't beat it alone, but he didn't have too. The dragon flew out of the cave and attacked a small town nearby. One townsman shot the dragon and killed it, ending the tragedy and the adventure. The real reason on how the dragon was killed was because of Bilbo. When he was in the cave, he saw a small place where the dragon armor didn't cover the flesh. It was conveniently located near the heart. It was a tough shot, but a young archer in the town had a good arrow. One shot and the dragon plunged into the ocean, killing it forever."

Afterward, our son wrote the following essay:Since The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was offered as an option for our family book club, I've been asking for it each month. In August, my pleas were granted, and we started the book well before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrives in theaters.A quick summary of ""the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings"": The comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins smokes his pipe, relaxes in his easy chair, watches the stars. He leads a peaceful life until Gandalf, an old white wizard, comes along and changes it forever. In spite of his Tookish ancestors, Mr. Baggins is a ""lazy"" hobbit who doesn't want adventures: ""Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them."" (p. 4) Of course, then, he is quite suprised when he is called to serve as a professional burglar for a band of thirteen dwarves. Later, he's even called upon to kill Smaug, a dragon with a diabolical appearance and a mammoth appetite. Of the thirteen dwarves, Thorin is the most eager to see Smaug die, for a few of the villages Smaug has destroyed were part of the kingdom of Thorin's fathers and forefathers, making Thorin the King Under the Mountain - not Smuag! With no choice but to join them, the hobbit has no idea of the dangers he must face to reach his goal, no idea how to kill a dragon (let alone a dragon who has been the glorious victor of who knows how many battles).My favorite part of their adventure takes place in the Elvenking's palace, when Bilbo is devising a plan to save the dwarves. He decides to put them all in barrels to be rafted off with the other empty barrels sent to ""the Long Lake... a town of Men still throve there."" This plan gets them out of the castle without being seen. But, as Tolkien points out, ""It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well as him yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there any one to pack him in, even if there had been a chance!"" (p.182)The mastermind of this journey, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) were friends, colleagues, and masters of fantasy. We can see the influence of the Chronicles on the many series written for younger readers today. Tolkien's influence can be seen in series that appeal to more advanced readers; The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are the ""granddaddy"" of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.In The Hobbit, Tolkien relies on the power of the mythological ""hero's journey."" Bilbo has a lot in common with Odysseus of Homer's Odyssey (perhaps the original hero) and Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars epic, a hero whose story was told four decades after Bilbo's. Hero stories teach us about our own potential. Heroes are called to journey and adventure for their heart's desire (Bilbo and Odysseus both want to return home, for example), but they must fight evil and learn about themselves before they can achieve their goals. Each of the heroes I mentioned are guided by mentors or wise guides: Odysseus by Athene, Luke by Obi-Won, and Bilbo by Gandalf. They each benefit from a magical talisman or sacred object: Odysseus has his magical bow and quiver of arrows and assorted amulets Athene and others provide during his twenty-year journey home; Luke Skywalker wields his father's lightsaber; and Bilbo has Sting, a short sword made by Elves, and the invisibility ring. In each of their stories, the hero must enter the ""underworld,"" a classic mythological detail. They are also encounter ugly, horrible beasts on land and in water, adding chilling action and, in some cases, humor to the stories. The heroes also, I might add, eventually achieve their goals.The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection. I look forward to more of the same exciting and enchanting elements that made The Hobbit so memorable."

In fact, there is a new appreciation for this book as it takes me away from my stuffy adult self, much like Mr. Baggins at the beginning, content in my little hole with my daily routine. I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure. This volume does not have the scope of the trilogy (except in the last chapters) and can fell ever so slightly twee at times but it has enough charm to take one to a magical place. And that, after all, is the joy of reading."

When one talks about Tolkien ""dilly-dallying and such"" one is referring to his complex style of writing. Quite frankly, Tokien is not ""less,"" he is ""more."" He demands that one pay more attention, he gives one more information. If one wishes to say that more isn't always better, then fine. The rest of us don't expect them to understand. Let me put it this way: It is like Champagne. People don't dislike Champagne, they merely don't understand it. These idiot reviewers ""Larry"", ""Curly"" and ""Moe"" don't prefer the taste of Champagne to 7UP, they simply can't taste it. Is it their limited capacity for intelligence? Is it upbringing? It doesn't really matter what it is, all that matters is that they can't ""taste"" The Hobbit. But those of us who can, can- and we love the taste. After all, we have no choice. These are people who would rather eat Aunt Jemima pancakes with fake syrup than have hot crepes rolled with fine preserves. Really, do the opinions of these people actually count? It is understood by many that an opinion is only an opinion- how untrue this is! In the legal world an opinion is something that is ruled and weighed to be best, to be most true. There _is_ such a thing as a good opinion, even the best opinion. And opinion can be right and an opinion can be wrong. I daresay that giving The Hobbit 3 stars is wrong. And why do I dare? Because if someone told us that cow manure tasted better than ice cream they would be wrong. The bottom line is this: Mozart is better than The Beetles; Ferraris are better than raced out Subarus and Ice Cream does, in fact, taste better than manure. If, like this idiot, you are a simpleton who can can neither hear, taste nor see then don't bother to post your opinions to the rest of us. Instead, take my advice and cozy yourself up with something you can understand like Harry Potter and let yourself float away to the world of un-imagination. You will be much happier and won't have to deal with the headaches of trying to figure out what Tolkien is trying to say, nor will you have to deal with the frustrations of not being able to see in full color and dimensions the Dwarves and Elves and Wizards they way that the rest of us can. I almost pity you, but then, you wasted 60 seconds of my life with degenerate reviews so on second thought, get out of my gene pool and stop breathing my air. It's people like you that make the rest of our lives so two-dimensional by preventing more work like The Hobbit from ever being created with your lack of understanding and abundance of stupidity.P.S. The Hobbit is a great book, arguably the greatest, certainly the greatest in its own league. It was written by an adult and is absolutely suitable for adults. The fact that it may also be enjoyed and understood by children is only a further credit to Tolkien's genius. Don't let the altogether too commonly found ramblings that this is a book for children discourage you from reading it if you haven't already. While not everyone is capable of enjoying it, it is criminal not to at least expose everyone to this book for anyone who is capable of enjoying it who is denied the oppurtunity has been cheated of one of the finest intellectual pleasures of this past century. My advice to you is to read it slowly and thoroughly. It is an experience like nothing else that will never be quite as magical the second time around.P.P.S. If you don't know what The Hobbit is about, in short, it is about Adventure. A great Adventure full of Swords and Magic; of Dwarves and of Elves and of Wizards and Hobbits; Good, Evil; Trolls and Goblins; Suspense, Excitement, Comedy and Tragedy; Music, Riddles and Poetry. All of this presented in one of the most unique styles of writing ever encountered; a style of writing that paints every detail of Tolkien's fantastic world in your mind as if you were there. Not a single word is wasted and every element of the story is to be enjoyed. If any of these things sound even remotely fascinating then read this book- you won't be disappointed.P.P.P.S. Comments about the illustrated versions for those trying to decide between the two illustrated versions of The Hobbit done by Alan Lee and Michael Hague: I recommend the Michael Hague edition hands down. The illustrations seem to fit the book much more than Lee's. Lee's anything but poor, but Mague's are more merry, bright and rich. The characters appear heartier and the colors set a better mood. More simply put, when I look at Lee's illustrations I feel like I'm standing in the dining room of somebody's grandmother- wallpaper, china dolls, lace and all- they just seem old and dry. Hague's characters, the dragon especially, seem more believable- when I turn the page I don't get a feeling like what I'm looking at is out of place. Another difference with Hague is that I am confident that anybody would enjoy his illustrations, but with Lee I merely see why some people 'might prefer it.' Hague really does have that illustration feeling I expect to see in a book; Lee's look like they belong on a museum wall. Also, I feel that Hague took a more direct interpretation of the book while Lee seemed to illustrate as he liked to fit his own style without much less regard to the book. Still, before buying I suggest you sample the art on the internet just to be sure of your tastes. However, if you're uncertain then I am confident that you and especially your children will enjoy Hague."

Tolkien is a book meant for those who have an imagination, or those who whish to enter the world of dragons, magic, treasure, goblins, gloomy figures, but most of all adventure.I thought a big reason that the book is great is that it's so great, is that its so vivid it feels like you are in the book, that you are seeing the characters right there, facing danger. The whole story of going to take back what is theirs even though they must face impossible odds, they themselves spoke that they wouldn't make it, the book is also written in some old English to make the characters seem older and mature. Though the book does a good job in letting one know what the characters are thinking and feeling, one cannot get a good grasp of what the characters are like. I believe the book lacks in this, because the characters are in such extreme emotional and physical conditions. I liked the message of I got from the book which was the underdog taking a stand, and not going out without a fight no matter the odds.This book makes you feel what the characters are because like I said it feels like you are right there in the middle of it all. It also does a good job of guessing you do not know whether something is going to pop out or where the must go next. It left me impressed with the way it was written; the vividness of the book is something one must read."

This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of ""The Hobbit,"" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.""The Hobbit"" is the prelude to the widely known ""The Lord of the Rings"" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Middle Earth,"" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in ""The Hobbit.""In my opinion ""The Hobbit"" is much lighter and not as dramatic as ""The Lord of the RIngs."" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, ""The Hobbit"" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed ""The Hobbit"" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,"" brutally honest!"" or ,""heart-wrenching!"" and ,""so sad i wanted to cry!"" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being ""brutally honest,""... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. ""The Hobbit"" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."

Very amusing for me, and very good for you- and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it,"" Gandalf said. This is how the great adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakshield, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin and Gloin began. The thirteen dwarves, one hobbit, and the wizard Gandalf set off to use `their' burglar (Bilbo) to steal back the treasure of the dwarves of Dale, stolen in the first place by Smaug the dragon. Gandalf leaves the group after they encountered three trolls, stayed at the home of Elrond, got lost in the goblins' lair, rested at the huge house of the man/bear Beorn, and reached the edge of Mirkwood. From there, the dwarves traveled alone and fought giant spiders, were captured by wood-elves, escaped by hiding in barrels, and were greeted and treated very nicely in Lake-town. Then the group traveled to the Lonely Mountain where the treasure was being watched carefully by Smaug. For a long time the dwarves and Bilbo waited until Smaug left and was killed by a Lake-town man. Then the treasure was fought over by dwarves, men, elves, goblins, eagles, and wolves. Finally the dwarf/elf/man/eagle side won the Battle of Five Armies and peace was restored. Bilbo was at last able to return home safely. I disliked the way this book was written, but I loved the story behind it all and I would recommend it to fantasy-lovers.One reason that I disliked this novel is that often the author would complicate simple things. For example, he would write ""You will get there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find out all about it."" Really all he needed, though, was- You will find out about it in a few days. The author definitely over used commas in The Hobbit. Sometimes the amount of detail was good, but a lot of instances the detail and description was confusing. One of the possible explanations for my confusion is the length of the author's sentences. For example, take the sentence, ""The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky."" I had to read this sentence a few times before fully grasping the meaning of it. This is just one of the many paragraph long sentences.One thing I did like about this book, though, was the story line and the characters. Once I finished the book I was able to look at the ""big picture"" of the story rather than the specific details. I especially enjoyed the part in the book where Bilbo (with his invisibility ring on) talks to Smaug. I also really liked when Bilbo was playing riddles with Gollum because I could guess them, too. I also liked the character of Bilbo. Even though it seems as though there are many characters, Bilbo is the main character so you come to like his clever, kind, curious, and brave ways.Lastly, I really didn't like the amount of violence in this book, especially in the end. The ways the battles are described are frankly quite gross. For example, during the fight between Bilbo and the dwarves against the spiders, one spider is described, ""Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks..."" Also, during The Battle of Five Armies, the valley was described as ""the goblins were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses."" These sentences were very disturbing to read.In conclusion, I didn't really like the way this book was written, but I loved the over all story and characters. The novel was violent and sometimes it was very confusing, but I did enjoy some parts of the book a lot. I recommend this book to fantasy loving readers who have a lot of time to read this novel and who don't mind reading about war.-C. Chaudhury"

The author expertly combines delightful riddles, the singing of well-versed songs, and adolescent banter amid charming creatures, spooky monsters, and minor magic to craft the ideal tale for young readers.The continuous adventure may start with many characters, but Bilbo composes the storyline from a third person view and interjects his own pleasant personality. Other than one affair relating to Gandalf and a Necromancer, all events are resolved in a thorough yet amusing manner. ""The Hobbit"" helped define expectations for a reader and laid the groundwork for future fantasy novels with the introduction of different races including Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, and their relationships between each other and with Humankind.The collection I own has ""The Hobbit"" along with all books of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series.

One morning after a hearty breakfast, the wizard Gandalf arrives, and that's when the trouble begins. Gandalf ends up inviting a flummoxing total of twelve dwarves over for tea the next day. The dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the glory and riches once held by their forefathers, but they need a ""burglar"" to help, and hobbits are small, stealthy creatures.Bilbo joins their party on a whim after being teased by the dwarves and praised by Gandalf for his yet-unknown abilities. He soon regrets his decision when the rolling fields past his home turn into a dark, foreign country, and he doubts that he has what it takes to carry out an adventure of this magnitude.As Bilbo meets (and is captured by) trolls, goblins, wolves, spiders, and wood-elves, he begins to use his practicality to his advantage; when engaged in riddles with Gollum under the mountain, for instance, his wit saves him from a very unfortunate end. And he puts his riddling skill to use with Smaug the Dragon as well, using their conversation as a chance to scope out the dragon's weakness.Happy scenes are interspersed throughout the tale to keep Bilbo from despairing entirely; they rest at the Last Homely House as the guest of a friendly elf, the noble eagles of the mountain come to their rescue more than once; they find a faithful friend in Beorn, who is usually gruff and wary of visitors; and the men of Lake-town herald their arrival to oust Smaug the Dragon from the dwarves' ancestral mountain.But more often than not--and certainly more than he would like!--it is small, hearth-loving Bilbo who ends up saving the day, when he and his friends are faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Bilbo grows from a homebody to a hero with ""a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck.""AnalysisThe Hobbit is one of the best books I've read all year.I know. I know! People have told me all my life that I need to read The Hobbit. But I always protested, claiming that I didn't like fantasy because there wasn't enough reality in it to ""connect"" to. Where I got this idea, I don't know--possibly from my brothers' fantastical explanations of Tolkien's books, which sounded far too removed from me to be interesting.As it turns out, The Hobbit is so widely regarded by readers of all stripes because of its humanity, its down-to-earth humor, and its realism. Who would've thought? (Everyone but me, I suppose.)As Michael D.C. Drout explains in The Modern Scholar: Rings, Swords, and Monsters: Exploring Fantasy Literature, applying Marxist theory to the story helps to understand its appeal: Bilbo represents the bourgeoisie, the trolls are members of the Cockney-accented working class, and Smaug the Dragon is the ruling class, literally rolling in riches. Tolkien himself was certainly no stranger to literature and theory, with a history of Anglo-Saxon epic poem translation under his belt. He incorporates themes common to Middle Age conquests while also sprinkling the book with a healthy dose of modern-day humor.Bilbo is an unexpected hero, the everyman who saves the day more than once. Though often he seems primarily occupied with eating breakfast, maintaining a tidy appearance, and yearning for his soft bed far from these dangerous adventures, he keeps a cool head when he and the dwarves seemed faced with certain doom. In fact, Bilbo's practical considerations are often what save them; while the dwarves stubbornly refuse to tell the Elf-King the purpose of their quest, which leads to their imprisonment, Bilbo cleverly rescues them, though his unorthodox methods produce more than a few grumbles among the dwarves.Bilbo is an incredibly likeable character with whom I can closely identify; who doesn't love a second breakfast? On a deeper level, Bilbo's moral ambiguity makes him a realistic hero; when he is bargaining with the men and the elves that are preparing to battle against the dwarves, who have become offensively greedy, he begins by complaining that the entire matter has made him uncomfortable and cranky, and he offers goods stolen from the dwarves to appease the other side.The Hobbit originated as a story Tolkien told his children, and the excellent narrative style and the thrilling twists and turns took me back to the days when my parents would read me bedtime stories. I felt like running from the hulking, humped figures of the goblins, and I shivered at the enormous hairy spiders of Milkwood Forest.Because of its intensely imaginative plot and Tolkien's masterful literary execution, The Hobbit is one of those few books that are equally attractive to kids and adults alike.

The Lord of the Rings came next with me through junior high and high school (I've read the trilogy 3 times) and now I'm a few pages away from finishing The Silmarillion. Tolkien's imagination and attention to detail cannot be outdone, and those who slapped Tolkiens first literary triumph with a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; rating had really take another look. The Hobbit intruduced us to a world as real as our own, therefore it stands to me as a real masterpiece. It gives you a taste of Middle-Earth, an exiting and thrilling touch of what his other books have to offer. If you want to begin to lose yourself in enjoyment and/or want a whole new world to explore, start with this book. You won't be sorry."

But things change when Gandalf the Wizard drops by--along with thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield. Suddenly, Bilbo finds himself on a pony heading away from the Shire and into the great unknown, to defeat a dragon and score treasure.I Liked:WOW! This was such a beautiful, enjoyable book!The Hobbit has never been my favorite Tolkien novel, mostly because it seems so childish (of course, it was written for kids). But the audiobook (and listening to Eldest prior to this) gave me a new appreciation for this joy.Firstly, there are the characters, primarily Bilbo. Bilbo really strikes me as a relatable guy. He's comfortable, content to live at home, and uninterested in adventures. He has to be pushed out of his home by Gandalf in order to get in on the fun. It reminds me so much of how I can be: content to go along, not trying new things until my sister forces me on a new path.My favorite character, though, is Gandalf. I like how quirky he is, how smart and even caring he is to Bilbo. Gandalf knew that Bilbo was perfect for the job and wouldn't let Bilbo back out no matter what. Plus, it's awesome to see recurring characters from the Lord of the Rings.The story itself is so wonderful! Tolkien writes in a third person omniscient, which allows him to employ a great sense of humor. I love how he often directs comments to the audience (explaining hobbits, trolls, and the like) and how light-hearted the tone is. As for the story proper: a pleasure! There is so much adventure, excitement, intrigue...I've read this before, but I still learned new things or was wowed all over again. I loved the tale of how Bilbo and the dwarves evaded the trolls (so simple, yet showcases how brilliant Gandalf was), how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, and the trek through the Forest (so scary!).And I love how this story fits into Tolkien's vision for Middle Earth. Elrond, Wood Elves, Mirkwood (Thranduil!), Gollum, the White Council...all these and more make appearances.And lastly, the narrator...ah, he was such a pleasure to listen to! I loved his voice, and I adored how he sung the songs and poems in the book! Not many could pull it off so convincingly!I Didn't Like:I don't have a lot of complaints, but there are a few. Firstly, there are thirteen dwarves, and most of them have little to no character. Fili and Kili were young, Bombur fat, Balin I believe had the best eyesight. Only Thorin had any development.One thing I've never liked about the Lord of the Rings or much of Tolkien's works was all the poetry. The Hobbit was no different; a few poems were great, but after a while, I grew tired of the lapsing into a poem.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.None.While not graphic, there are some intense battles between goblins and the troop in the Misty Mountains and in the final battle.Overall:I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never been a Hobbit fan, but this time around, I might be converted. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's a piece of your childhood in novel form. Highly recommended for those who want to be kids again.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"

I found that I could not set this book down. With each page, I was that much more drawn into the realm of Middle Earth, and I made myself put the book down for a little bit in order to enjoy it.The characterization in this book is phenomenal. Both the protagonists and antagonists throughout the novel help creat the landscape of the book, as well as set the foundation for Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, displays the ideal character in that he is forced into a world of adventure of magic. As an innocent creature unaware of the outside world, Bilbo matures throughout the book, and is a classic example of a character who, by the end of the book, has developed into a great intellectual character. Bilbo continues to display this intellect throughout the Lord of the Rings.I have experienced many a conflict with other readers who did not enjoy the Hobbit, and I'm not saying that this book is in everyone's favor, but any reader of fantasy, magic, and adventure will love this book.

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."

I am primarily a theologian. But I loved The Hobbit.With the announcement that Tolkien's great prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will soon be made into a movie trilogy of its own right, I thought it was time to delve into this classic adventure myself. I am so glad that I did.Let's start with character development. Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Wizard are two of the best characters Tolkien has ever created. (And he has created hundreds!) In The Hobbit, we learn to trust each of them. Bilbo emerges as a reluctant yet heroic protagonist. He is hesitant, traditional, mannered, quick-witted, and yet shockingly courageous. This despite his diminutive stature! Drawn into an adventure larger than life--to recapture dwarvish treasure held captive by a murderous dragon--Biblo shows himself over and over again to be the most reliable compatriot of the band.Gandalf on the other hand is Biblo's perfect compliment. He is strong, indomitable, larger than life, and yet flighty and preoccupied. He swoops in at just the right moments to rescue the would-be treasure hunters. In chapter five (revised in later editions) we also meet the grotesque Gollum, bent helplessly inward by the ring's debilitating powers. The repartee between Bilbo and Gollum while the ring's fate stands on the line is deeply memorable. We only learn later that all of Middle Earth hangs also in the balance of this test of wits between the deformed Gollum and the sharp-tongued hobbit.In terms of visual drama and setting, Tolkien in unmatched. He is able to create vast worlds that seem both familiar and impossible to the reader. Throughout his works, the Shire, the Misty Mountains, the Mines of Moria, Esgaroth, and Mirwood are described with vivid imagery. Tolkien creates a world that can both enrapture and repulse his readers. Few fictional writers can create and balance such elaborate settings as Tolkien does. (Thankfully, the movies have not let us down in portraying these stunning worlds).Most readers will be not surprised to note that The Hobbit (like The Lord of the Rings series) contains a substantial amount of poetry. In Tolkien, this functions to create a timeless quality, blending Middle Earth's mythic age into current bends in the plot. The poetry often emerges in the form of dwarvish songs, assuring the reader that the characters themselves are captivated by myths and legends of their own. These poetic songs and tales are sometimes warning, and sometimes consoling the heroes along their path of destiny.The plot itself, primarily a dragon-slaying tale, never lags. In each successive chapter, Bilbo finds himself entrapped in another web (once literally!) that seems at first inescapable. Once Biblo and the dwarves--led by the overly confident Thorin Oakenshield--actually meet the dragon Smaug, the reader stands convinced that their gold-snatching feat will at last be impossible. Only the heroic resolve of a certain halfling will prove otherwise! But I won't spoil the tale for you here.The Hobbit ends exactly where the reader hopes it will all along: with a cataclysmic battle scene featuring all the forces of Middle Earth present. Men, elves, dwarves, wargs, gobblins, eagles, and one particularly irrepressible wizard all arm themselves for battle to the death for fame and fortune.No wonder this work is timeless!Matthew Everhard is the Senior Pastor of Faith Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Brooksville, Florida."

Tolkien until I saw the movie. I didn't like the movie very much until my friend brought it over and let me hold it. I instantly fell in love with it. And felt that I was almost forced to Buy Tolkien's Literary works. After much and much hesitition, I knew that I was bound to like the book so I said why not go all out and buy this GREEN LEATHERETTE HOBBIT, AND THE LORD LORD OF THE RINGS RED LEATHERETTE.editions of the book.I read the Hobbit in 6 days. The book starts off very entertaing but later on becomes rather dry. However not dry enough to make it unbearable.The Green Leatherette edition is 317 pages, and about 4 full color glossy drawings, and as well as about 10 or more other drawings. The Drawings are not bad, especailly since they were drawn by Tolkien himself who is known for his writing skills not his drawing skills. The book becomes dry when they leave the wood elf spot, and they have to go through mirkwood, where there are many spiders and other creatures. The book then picks up later when they arrive at Loneley mountain, the end of the book, where they have to steal the treasures from the Dragon Smaug who guards the treasures. Which is about 60 pages of the book, completely on the part with Smaug and before Smaug dies.The book I would reccommend to people between the ages of 5-?? the book is very good, and should be read by all readers of all ages.The book has illustrations but does not need them to help the story progress, I could litterally sit there and draw out the things described with out being bored, as other books do.The book has nearly no violence and is a very light hearted adventure of a ""hobbit"" Bilbo Baggins who never went on any adventures or unexpected events, but with his meeting up with the Wizard ""Gandalf The Grey"" he tells Bilbo about going on a quest that will make him rich. The next day, Gandalf comes back with the Dwarves who Bilbo will spend his adventure with and tells him everything(or not so much as everything).The quest starts simple enough and seems like a typical fantasy( which J.R.R. Tolkien is the author who spawned the genre as a whole) Bilbo is hired as a burglar to accompany a group of thirteen Dwarves to the Loneley mountain. Once at the Loneley mountain Bilbo will have to pilfer the Dragon Smaug of all his un needed treasures.

It was the gateway to the likes of Donaldson, Eddings, Kerr, Feist and many others the sort of stuff which I specifically look for when I want to read something relaxing. Tolkien has managed to transport the reader to a completely different world populated with absolutely delightful characters. I have read it countless times in countless situations, in an airliner crossing the Atlantic, in the centre of Picadilly Square, on a bus, on the underground, in bed, by the campfire, during examination time, wether I'm exhausted or bristling with energy... this is stuff that anyone can enjoy at any time and in any surroundings or situation. This sort of literature is a good lesson for all of us to stop taking ourselves and our petty concerns too seriously. It teaches us to be children once again and to experience joy at simple things. Everyone should read it at least once, especially adults !"

Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first of a series of books that constitute Tolkien's legacy, one which, like many other literary masterpieces, has stood the test of time. The hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, is forced to face his destiny by the wizard Gandalf; one that gradually gains him the respect of his companions (thirteen dwarves, along with the wizard) and many other characters in a year-long adventure through the dangers of facing the meanest creatures and walking through the most adverse places.Ultimately, the tapestry of events which Tolkien brilliantly weaves around Bilbo and his friends confront him with Smaug, the terrible dragon who has long seized the dwarves' treasure. Only the combination of luck, intelligence and a courage which he never thought he had, help Bilbo to sort through all he's faced with to come out as a better being, one that can see beyond the blindness that greed brings into smaller spirits (not necessarily because it affects dwarves more than it affects others in the story). It is there where the true greatness and universal character of the story lies.The best thing about Tolkien's fantasy books is that you can relate to them in so many ways that they no longer seem so distant from what could actually occur to you."

As an adult who loves fantasy and science fiction, I was shocked when I realized that I had not yet read this tale. When I learned that a dear friend was reading it at bedtime to her first grader, I realized that I was long overdue. This is an amazingly delightful story. Aside from its tale, it looks at beings of different backgrounds and their conflicts. Not everything works out perfectly, and the ends don't always justify the means.

Since Peter Jackson chose to stretch one small children's book into 3 long movies it turns out you can easily read the book chapters covered by the movie faster than you can watch the movie, and reading the whole book only takes a few hours.As a children's book I think it is pretty damn good. You can see Tolkien building up ideas for Lord of the Rings: the easily-killed but numerous spiders are the building blocks for the much more sinister and powerful Shelob, the swords taken from the trolls were very reminiscent of the swords acquired from the Barrow-wight and used to kill the Nazgul, and the Battle of Five Armies is a smaller scale template for the epic battle of Helm's Deep.On a less positive note, I found the foreshadowing fairly annoying, and I'm not sure why it is there. Maybe Tolkien thought kids needed to be reassured that everything was going to work out in the end, or needed all the dots explicitly connected?&#34;...which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end....And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight. Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&#34;Great children's book, and I'm going to score it as such, I certainly loved it as a kid.4 stars.

Tolkien was a lover of the Norse myths, the Germanic, and his work shows it. The man, far from being just a professor, was a genius, creating his own mythology from myths that already came before hand. The Hobbit is a wonderful way to get started on his work. The Hobbit is very much a myth for our time, with the wise old counselor who helps the reluctant hero to realize his full potential.The story starts out with Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, living a quiet life, only to have his life interrupted by a the wizard Gandalf and a group of dwarves. It appears a rather nasty dragon has stolen the dwarves' treasures and is now making his home in their lair. It's up to poor, little Bilbo to muster the strength that he never knew he had, so that he can help reclaim what is rightfully the dwarves, all the while dealing with goblins, trolls, and other uncomfortable situations.This is the perfect book for those new to Tolkien to start with. It's not as dark, dreary, and violent as Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" series or ""The Children of Hurin,"" (all of which are wonderful must read books: ""The Lord of the Rings"" being my favorite) or as complex as ""The Similarion"" (also a must read), but an excellent starting place for most ages. This is one of the most incredible books ever written, one of the most amazing stories ever told, and I've read it numerous times. This version, with illustrations by Alan Lee, helps accentuate the mythical world Tolkien created even more, breathing life and magic into the story. ""The Hobbit,"" is a book I look forward to having the joy of reading to my future children, sparking their imagination, awaking the magic within them, in the process. To those that like Norse/Germanic myths, there are plenty of things you'll recognize in names and tales. In fact, there is a little nod to ""Beowulf,"" in it. To those that just want their imaginations to soar, to be taken to another world, then this is the right book, as it has helped inspire today's fantasy books and video games. Read this treasure and enjoy."

These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."

The great dragon Smaug has been terrorizing the country and must be destroyed before his work of death can go any farther. Bilbo and the Dwarves go off to destroy this abomination. They are soon swept up in a quest filled with evil orcs, giant spiders, and much worse hidden dangers. Although Tolkien does well in describing the settings and characters, he doesn't really do too well with his action. Some authors, such as C.S. Lewis or J.K. Rowling, have the ability to create the sweeping kind of action that seems to just bring you along and keep you reading whether you like the story or not. J.R.R. Tolkien doesn't, no matter what you say. At the beginnning of the story, he seems to just drone on and on until by the time he's gotten to the point, you forget what he's really trying to say. Of course he does well in his description, but there is too much. And he does great while writing about the action areas, but afterwards it returns to that bleak nothingness of words that never catches your interest. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a work of art writing this book, but he fails at keeping the reader glued to the pages like some authors can."

It was great to see Bilbo's character evolve from beginning to end, as well as get introduced to all the great characters that populate Tolkien's world. I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!). My only gripe is Gandalf - I thought he was extremely underdeveloped and there was so much more we could have learned about him. As a stand alone story, The Hobbit is a classic, but it just felt like Tolkien was going through the motions and saving his best work for his later novels..."

This book more so than any other that I read as a child opened my mind to the vastness of humanities imagination. The purity of J.R.R. Tolkiens fantasy allows the reader to become totally immersed in the fantasy and adventures of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, Esquire. From Dragons to Wizards the reader develops a sense of comraderie with the characters as the overcome foes and their own fears and failings.Now as a father of four children I have taken each one of my kids into this wonderful world. As each of my childred reached the age of five I would carefully tuck them in and then together we would imbark upon this most amazing adventure. Re-reading this book every five years or so has only brought closer to the characters and the story itself. But perhaps the greatest joy is seeing the excited look on the face of my child as Bilbo first tricks theTrolls or when he first steals the ring of Gollum in the caves of the Goblins and certainly the climatic event of the burglary into the den of the sleeping Smaug, the dragon who awaits all of them under the mountain. This is a book rich with adventure and fantastic episodes like no other. Truly this is a book to grow up with and I would venture to say -- to stay young with through the eyes of a child."

I've read it many, many times and will continue to read it over and over again. But, to be honest, I don't really view it as anything more than a highbrow bodice ripper, hence my title calling it ""trashy."" It's fancy beach reading, but I mean that in the nicest way possible. It's written in a very compelling way and will keep you entertained. Despite it's length, it's a book I can -- and do -- finish rather quickly whenever I read it. It's a pageturner, there's no doubt about it.lMy real issue with this book is, naturally, the historical inaccuracies and great liberties that author Gregory takes with the story of the Tudors. Inaccuracies that she tries to pass off as historical fact. But I am still able to enjoy and appreciate it while also appreciating non-fiction books on the same subject. I sort of view this as an adaptation of history: Movie adaptations rarely follow the book exactly and always take liberties, but a person can still love both the book and the movie. That's kind of how I approach The Other Boleyn Girl."

Costas Jr.,1/2,4.0,1101686400,"Not history, but you'll learn a lot anyway","I am a big history buff (American mostly) and am often skeptical of historical novels. This was an exception for me. I don't know all that much of England's long royal history. I do know enough to be aware of the high-level intrigue that used to go on in those days to achieve power, but it was really interesting to see it so well-developed and told in this book. A gander through the internet will give you a more accurate picture of what is today accepted as truth and what is in fact the author's imagination. In the back of the paperback edition, the author also tells some of what she invented and what happened to some of the characters after Anne's death. If you realize all this, this is one immensely enjoyable read. The almost 700 pages are turned very quickly and I think you will learn some very valuable things about life in the English courts and England/Europe in general during the 16th century. I think the author's intentions are to pique our interest in either the period or the personalities enough that we might be interested in seeking more historical information. That's what it did for me. I would not mind reading the book that followed this one, watch the movie ""Elizabeth"" again or even read an actual history of this episode in British history. Although the main protagonist (Anne's sister, Mary) is historically obscure and without a lot of documentation, many of the other characters are significant enough in history that it should have been easy for the author to do enough research to present portraits as accurate as any historian could. What I came away with regarding Henry VIII, Wolsey and other royals, is not much different than what I came in with. For those sticklers for absolute fact, there are history books. This is a fine introduction for the more casual reader that, to me, gives an accurate enough picture of those days and a plausible description of Anne's life and reign."

2608,0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,,,84/99,1.0,1178409600,"Inept, Unintelligent, and Historically Innacurate.","Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Tudor England. I am also a fan of reading, particularly historical fiction. My favorite subject would be, of course, Anne Boleyn, the Boleyn family, and her friends. I heard that The Other Boleyn Girl was chronicling Mary Boleyn, the relatively unknown sister of Anne, and I was undoubtedly excited. I've always thought of Mary as the less succesful sister, the foolish one, who enjoyed the bodily pleasures and failed in her ambitions(there being overwhelming evidence to support this), as opposed to the witty, intelligent, wordly and ambitious Anne who was spirtually adept and not neccisarily a physical being. I, of course have read books where Anne was not all of these and still enjoyed them so don't think my intense admiration for Anne is coloring my review.Let me start off with the basics; Characterization. Gregory apparently skipped this class-or at least was asleep for the majority of it. All of her characters are two-deminsional-at best. Let's start with the protagonist-Mary. For no reason whatsoever Mary has grown up superior to her family...despite the fact that she had no outside influence to change this. She never mentions a mentor who taught her her values and moral superiority,she is not particularly religious,she merely is better-something that goes intensly against human nature. Mary's intentions are soley good all the time, she just wants to be with her beautiful children and escape her evil family. I suppose her good nature was supposed to leave me on pins and needles just hoping she gets that beautiful happily ever after-in fact, it had the exact opposite effect. I found Mary's troubles superficial in comparision to those around her, the majority of whom where sincerely better people with causes they were dedicated to. Mary was simply self involved to the point of making me nauseous. When her sister gives birth to a girl who is apparently-and innacuratly- unloved whom is apparently her sisters downfall(again, innacurately)-and what is Mary's thought process? She is not concerned for her sister who is now treading down the road to execution, not for the King she once loved who is bitterly dissapointed in the woman he love not being what he expected, and not even for the poor baby girl-but for herself. She tells her husband that she can't believe she's going to have to wait for another pregnancy to ""escape"". When Jane Seymour is slowly taking Anne's place as Queen at court, and Anne is understandbly saying how much she wishes she was dead, Mary returns with a ""Anne that is so horrible"". What? What is Anne supposed to feel? Jane certainly wanted Anne dead. No one around her is good enough for Mary, and her morality seemed to grate on my nerves. At one point she threatens suicide to her sister-and I was half hoping she would actually go through with it to end this narcissisticly schreeching, whiny narration.Anne, I am supposed to gather, was the exact opposite of her wonderful sister. This wonderful, intelligent, witty and albiet ambitious woman is reduced to a pure evil caraciture. There are no limits to her evil, everything about her is cruel, she doesn't hesitate in way before committing the most henious acts, with none of the basic human emotion of regret. Turn to any given page and there is an example of her evilness. There is not one nice thing said about Anne in this book. Even on the eve of her execution she doesn't seem to want to repent anything. Why would Henry literally turn church and state on its head for this woman, one might ask? Good question, and I'm still trying to figure it out. Anne had many, many, many admirers because she was a very attractive, intelligent and generally pleasing being. She may have had moments of cruelty, though so has everyone, but that does not mean they are a one-deminsional harpy with little thought above how she can advance herself. Even though Gregory, I'm gathering, wanted me to hate her, I really only loved her simply becuase she was different than that whiny protagonist.The other characters are equally unbelievable. Thomas and Elizabeth Boleyn were certainly ambitious, but I doubt they were this careless when it came to their children. Ambition does not equal recklessly evil, though I got the feeling that this is what the moral of this story was supposed to be. Henry had no depth whatsoever, and was constantly WHINING! He was King of England, he really need not whine so much. William Stafford is supposed to be the ideal, supportive man who is deeply commited to Mary-for God knows why- and he is basically a characticature. George Boleyn is either doing two things-hanging around his sister's bedchamber or cavorting with his male lover. Katherine of Aragon was-historically speaking-certainly a wronged woman, but I have trouble believing she was so unhumanly saintly. This really isn't the only book that does this-authors who are sympathetic to Katherine tend to make her out-of-this-world Godly. Katherine was a human being, with flaws just like the rest of us-I'd love to see some of them sometime.Now the laundry list of historical errors:Mary Boleyn spent many years at the French Court, where she had quite the reputation of being permiscuous(the King of France called her ""my English mare"" becuase he ""rides her so often""), and sent home in disgrace because of it. She was probably the older sister(and five or so years older than this), but if she was not, Anne would probably be three or four years older, becuase Mary would hardly be sleeping around at 11. Mary was Henry's mistress for perhaps two years, and her children were not his. Anne and Henry Percy did not connsummate their engagement-it would have been impossible to break. The Boleyn ""family meetings"" probably did not happen-Anne and Mary probably both made their way to the King's bed on their own, seeing as how Mary had done it before and Anne staunchly resisted his advances for a year before becoming emotionally-though not physically-involved. Mary probably didn't even consider Katherine of Aragon's feelings-mistresses in Kings were considered common, and if a King did not have one he was considered weak. Mary was hardly cast aside with nothing, she was given all the favors of a royal mistress. Anne's cruelty to Mary Tudor and Katherine has been overexaggerated for hundreds of years-she was indifferent at worst to them both. Fisher and More were executed in that order, how could that not get past an editor? Anne loved Elizabeth fiercly and intensly, and did not neglect her in the wet nurses' chamber, but insisted on breast feeding. Anne's miscarraige of a deformed baby and George's homosexuality were taken directly from Retha Warnicke's biography, which is perfectly fine, but Warnicke's main theory is the discounting of Chapuys as an accurate source, who has been the major source to prove to people that she was evil. She uses undeniable evidence to prove this, and yet Gregory did clearly did not use this, so she either only read the parts that sounded cool to her, or simply skimmed the back. Mary Boleyn was banished from court and then begged for years to be allowed back, she did not make a stealthy escape, and she never comes back, not even when her siblings are rotting in the Tower. Anne was a surpisingly liberal Queen,and saved hundreds upon hundreds from the Inquosition, something Gregory conviently forgets-she also donated thousands of pounds to charity-which is equivalant to millions nowadays. Not one heretic was burned while Anne was Queen, although hunreds were burned before and hundreds after. Anne saved both Catholics and Protestants from the burning post. And for GOD'S SAKE; Anne did not commit incest!!!! She swore ""upon the damnation of mine own mortal soul"" that she did not, evenwhen she didn't neccisarily have to. No one seriously believes Anne commited adultery, or was a witch, and absolutely no one believes she had sex with her brother. Why does Gregory feel the need to include this? I'm willing to bet the vast majority were hating Anne at this point anyways, so including charges she was certianly innocent of was just plain disrepectful. And there were so many, many more.After reading all of this, I was naturally inflamed, but after reading the interview in the back I was half ready to hunt Gregory down and accuse her of incest with her brother. She says things like ""historians are divided as to whether the charges actually took place"" Um...no they are not. I think Gregory is the first person to insist that they could be true in a hundred years. ""Anne was not a woman who let morals get in her way"" This is a strange sentence, and also patenly false. All of the sources listed in Gregory's ""bibliography"" have varying degrees of respect for Anne, and Alison Weir clearly does not like her, but even the ones who do not think she was a Godly creature insist that she did have morals and virtues. Gregory also insists ""Anne was clearly guilty of one murder"" What?! I have no idea what she is talking about here, genuinely no idea. She insists that there is evidence that she tried to poison Fisher. This evidence is a rumour that started contemporarily, in which Anne sent a messanger to him to tell him to avoid Parliment should he become sick. This is a rumor, and Weir is perhaps the only historian who believes it. Gregory says the broad facts of Mary's life are true in the novel-of which they are not. She discounts every other type of fiction and constantly toots her own horn. She says it's perfectly reasonable that Anne would have commited incest with her brother to getting pregnant and that George would be the ""obvious choice"". It's an odd world when your brother is the obvious choice for getting pregnant. Anne had many admirers who would die for her (Thomas Wyatt ""Whoso List to Hunt"" for example), and if she were to take a lover(which she didn't) I would say that she had many to chose from. Also, the common knowledge of that time was that women were responsible for miscarraiges and the sex of babies. If she was miscarrying, she would have certainly thought it was her fault, and taking a lover would not help.I would give it zero stars if I could. Please pass this one up. But if you simply cannot refrain, I suggest buying either Warnicke, Bruce's, or Ive's biography and read it first, just to laugh at how ridiculous Gregory is."

The author does a fabulous job of making these historical sisters come to life and presents a compelling tale beginning at Anne Boleyn's introduction to the English court, always showing them as three-dimensional people with real desires, needs, and inner conflicts due to their outer circumstances.I found it so intriguing to learn more about this time period and the relationship of Anne to Mary, and to their family, and to the royal family.

What if the charges were true? Anything is plausible. Gregory scores major points in just being able to write such a tomb of a novel, however, there are some choices made that are hard to swallow. Mary being the youngest of the Boleyn sisters is one, their ages for another. What happened to the part of the story where Mary was KICKED OUT of French Court for her promiscuity with King Francis I? She was closer to 18 than 12 at the time this story began. A small thing, but it's Anne Boleyn behavior in this book that was very hard for this reader to believe. Screaming at the King in front of his court. Are you kidding me? The last act is also a hard one to swallow. All historian agree that once Mary was banished from court, she never returned (and she went on to have a total of 14 children). Which is more feasible than Gregory's suggestion that the whole court would forget about Mary and not involve her in the intense interrogation scenes. At bare minium George's wife would have brought up her name. Still, this is an engaging read and do offer some ligit possibilities and this novel is definitely worth your time and money, but do not learn your history through fiction novels."

There is fiction sprinkled in to fill the gaps of course - otherwise you have non-fiction. That's the ""fiction"" part of Historical Fiction.We don't even know for sure if Mary was the elder or younger sister to Anne. Historians disagree on that fact and put her birth anywhere from 1500-1507. This book chooses a position that she is a year younger than Anne.What has been documented in history is followed closely here. Dates and times, locations, etc. The rest is a enjoyable, plausable story.The book was a great read and was easy to follow. I prefered ""The Queen's Fool"" to this one however, perhaps because it was my first of Phillipa Gregory's."

The Other Boleyn Girl was far from boring. In fact, it was amazing. The story contained so much sex, scandal, deception, and rivalry, it was shocking and deeply entertaining.I saw the movie adaption years ago, and after reading the book, it's obvious the movie was perfectly cast. Obviously, the book went much deeper into the story. The book was long (over 600 pages) and I loved every single page of it. I could not put it down and spent a few mornings bone tired due to ""just a few more pages"" that found me awake and reading hours after I meant to go to sleep.So much happens in The Other Boleyn Girl. The story really only spans about fifteen years, but it has a epic feel. The rivalry between Anne and Mary goes well beyond the average sibling rivalry. King Henry is a tool. I believe it's historically documented that he was the epitome of an spoiled, overgrown child, but seeing him in action, so to speak, makes me wonder how he survived so long without being poisoned.The queen fights for her man in a peculiar way, leaving the reader to wonder why she ever thought that would work. George, brother to Mary and Anne, brings about a very interesting and surprising look at court. And the rest of the Boleyn family, and their involvement in younger generations lives - especially sex lives - reeks of sleaze and conniving. Actions and events so shocking, yet thoroughly realistic, make The Other Boleyn Girl very memorable.There are multiple romances in The Other Boleyn Girl, each markedly different from the next. These relationship do well to show how love, and lust, can vary greatly between couples. More than anything else, The Other Boleyn Girl is about the lengths a woman would go to to become and remain queen. No line remained uncrossed in The Other Boleyn Girl and I found it to be juicer than any modern tabloid."

It is not a boring story about re-evaluating one self or coming of age. It is a wonderful tale that Gregory weaves superbly. I finished the book today, and now I don't know what to do with myself.

However, as the story progresses, we grow to love Mary's even-tempered perspective, while we shrink from Anne's ever-increasing power--and temper.

You do it beautifully.""","""You just keep on being sweetly stupid, Mary. You do it beautifully.""Mary Boleyn is one of Queen Katherine's many ladies-in-waiting. But things change when she catches King Henry VIII's eye. Her family, led by Uncle Thomas Howard, quickly push her into becoming the King's mistress, but Anne, Mary's sister, is never satisfied. Set amidst the turmoil of King Henry's early rule, we follow Mary through her affair with the King, the strife between King Henry and Queen Katherine, and the marriage of King Henry to Queen Anne.The best way I can describe this book is ""guilty pleasure"". There is so much to dislike about the book, and yet I was entertained for the entire part. Not to mention, this book made me research Tudor England and the whole drama with King Henry VIII and his many wives, and any book that makes me interested in looking up history or researching the backstory gets a bit of a boost in my book.PLEASE NOTE: I am no historian, nor am I particularly well-versed in this era. Therefore, I am not going to get into much detail about whether or not this book is historically accurate. There are other reviews that go into FAR better detail about whether this is accurate to history; I will defer to them. But I do caution: if you are expecting 100% accuracy, I would encourage you to pass this book up. Just the itsy bitsy bit of research I have done doesn't seem to quite match up to what PG presents here.With that out of the way, let's get on to the good stuff!First off, I really didn't like our ""protagonist"", Mary Boleyn. In Gregory's story, Mary Boleyn, the sometimes ""other Boleyn girl"" (though the term was applied occasionally to Anne), is the younger sister of Anne (this is one of those areas where historians will tell you that most likely, Mary was the eldest--and in this book, I really felt that Mary acted more like the eldest than the youngest). She is married to William Carrey and quickly attracts the eye of the King. Her family then tells her to seduce him and bed him, which she does. But after the birth of her second child, Anne whisks the King's attention, and Mary is left in the background.I'll admit, I like it when characters aren't perfect, aren't the best or smartest in a field, aren't able to make the right decision each and every time, have actual flaws. But Mary really tries the patience. According to history, Mary was the beauty but not so bright (it was Anne who was the brains), but Mary in TOBG seems unable to put the simplest conclusions together.For instance, when William Stafford leaves to secure a farm for a ""court lady"" he's been interested in, Mary IMMEDIATELY assumes he has been seeing someone BESIDES her and snubs him. OF COURSE, we know that William, who knows Mary's desire to be a simple farmer's wife, was actually purchasing the farm for HER. (In Gregory's defense, this Misunderstanding did not last very long.)Another count against Mary is her passivity. I know women in this period do not have the freedoms that modern women do, but Mary was a complete doormat. She rarely even tried to defy her family. Most of her actions are either A) forced upon her or B) reactions to other people's actions. She doesn't initially WANT to seduce the King, but her family forces her. She balks at helping Anne, but her family tells her to. She wants to see her kids, but her family won't let her; therefore, she doesn't see her kids.What is almost worse is when Mary complains about how she can't do anything, how if she had her own free will, she wouldn't have done X. She could have put up a little more defense, tried a little harder, pushed a little more. Or she could have just been kicked out of her family. But personally, I like Queen Katherine's response to Mary's BS best:""If you had not been tempted, you would not have fallen. If it was not in your interest to betray me, then you would have been loyal. Go away, Lady Carrey. You are no better than your sister, who pursues her own ends like a weasel and never glances to one side or the other.""And that leads to my other complaint. Mary likes to think she is way better than her sister, Anne...but most of what Anne does, Mary has done before. Or she gloats (and I mean GLOATS) about what she didn't do. Such as:+ When Anne was sent to Hever, Mary writes Anne every week and gushes about her pregnancy and how the King lurves her so much.+ Enjoying how Anne has to wait on her, then being p!ssy when the tables are turned.+ Being upset when Anne gets married to the King, but legitimizes her affair with the King (in fact, I never felt that Mary was at all guilty for sleeping with the married King or committing adultery against her own husband).+ Being upset when Anne is pregnant with the King's baby, but when she was pregnant, she rubbed her sister's nose in it.And then we have how she has an affair and can't BELIEVE how her husband William Carey is upset at her (uh, duh?) or her claim to be loyal to the Queen even though she is sleeping with the King. For the latter, she even names the child she bore through Henry after Queen Katherine! (How tacky!)But it seems that Mary is supposed to be the perfect, sweet sister. She is loyal to the Queen, even turning against her sister. At one point, Mary becomes a confidant of sorts to the Queen, and the two giggle about how awful Anne is--sure, that's believable! We also know Mary is ""good"" because she wants to abandon court life for country life after a mere 3 month stay at Hever! And then, when she becomes a farmer's wife, she ADORES making cheese and cooking and has NO PROBLEMS with all the work she suddenly has to do. And while Anne meets a terrible end, Mary gets a happily ever after--her children, a loving husband, a little farm, and all the things she ever wanted.Instead of being the perfect, sweet, innocent, beleaguered sister, Mary came across as a dense, two-faced, passive hypocrite, unable to do anything for herself, who somehow got everything she wanted but didn't deserve.But as much as I despised Mary, I adored Anne and Queen Katherine. Sure, Anne is personified as a bawdy devil, a woman desperate for power and the Queen's throne instead of an intelligent, highly religious woman who really did love the King, but I felt that a lot of what she did was understandable. She was smart and cunning; when her family didn't support her (and for a good portion of the book, it seemed they did EVERYTHING to make her life miserable), she made her own way using her own wits and skill. Mary needed guiding throughout her entire time of her affair; Anne was more than capable of handling herself. Her struggles to give birth to a son were heart-rending; her desperation understandable (not that I really believe she slept with her brother or was a witch). As for Queen Katherine, she was a respectable woman, a good wife. I felt bad for how King Henry put her away in favor of Anne.As for the rest of the characters, they are pretty one-dimensional. King Henry is ALMOST ALWAYS called a ""boy"" by Mary, which was irritating and disturbing. King Henry, I always got the impression, was a pretty strong, charismatic guy. I'm sure he had some childlike aspects, but I felt nearly every other time Mary saw him, she was comparing him to a child. If Mary found him so childlike, how could she have a years-long affair? Ew! Jane Parker is so snoopy and awful; Jane Seymour is so virtuous and sickeningly pure; Uncle Thomas was pure evil; George honestly felt campy gay (I'm surprised more people didn't find out about his orientation); William Stafford is so ""wonderful"" and ""manly"", I wanted to be sick. None of them really stood out; none of them felt like people whom I could interact with and meet on a daily basis.A key component of this story, the whole reason I believe it was written, was to show the competition between the two sisters, to compare and contrast. But while The Cranes Dance did an EXCELLENT job of showing two sisters who love each other but feel threatened by each other as well, this book flopped. I felt like both girls hated each other viscerally, until one of them would do something unexpectedly nice to the other or say how fond they were of their sister (and mean it).Another thing that I felt really hurt the story was one key historical component. I know I said I wouldn't nitpick history, but I felt this component REALLY affected the story. There is NO WAY Mary's son would have ever been considered an heir apparent to the King, even if he were to marry her after the fact. The King already had an illegitimate son through Bessie Blount; he would have been the first in line if illegitimate children were in line for the throne. So all of the family's crazy talk and effort to get Mary married to King Henry and how their illegitimate son would be heir is silly and ultimately pointless. Sure, if the King married Mary, she MIGHT have another son, but that is the only way for an heir to come.After Mary's affair with the King, the story really stops being about her and is instead about Anne. I guess it makes sense, but when the story tries to return to being about Mary, it is boring and so drowned in sugary, sweet sappiness, I thought I was going to go into a coma. Mary and William are a boring couple. They meet, they fall in love, life goes perfectly for them (with a few mild speedbumps that are IN NO WAY Mary's fault). William is not at all frustrated with Mary for being unable to do simple household tasks; Mary loves being a housewife and getting her hands rough and dirty. William is A-OK with Mary's earlier affair; Mary has no problem giving up court life to live in the country. Oh, and they have AMAZING MIND-BLOWING SEX. The relationship COULD have been interesting; these two characters come from wildly different worlds. But because Mary has to have everything turn out perfect for her, there was no drama.I must commend PG (or her editors, future books will tell which of those is true) on the brisk pace. Very rarely does the book just sit around and do nothing; for the most part, the story moves and is pretty engaging. I might not have liked some of the characters, but I WAS interested in seeing how they would turn out. And I listened to this book to the very end with little regret for the time I put into it (and I've regretted many a book I've sat listening to through to the end).One more thing: Susan Lyons, you are an amazing narrator! Pat yourself on the back!I do not recommend this book for history buffs or hard-core Tudor enthusiasts, but for those that don't mind some mindless, deliciously catty entertainment, this is a decent read. At the very least, it will make you head to the library or the ebook store or to Wiki to do some research of the time; at the best, you will have spent a few hours (depending on whether you are reading or listening, of course) immersed in a time left behind long ago. I certainly don't regret the time I spent listening to it or the new knowledge I have of the Tudors.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"

However, I was pleasantly surprised. I wish that more professors in college would have required us to read books like this for our history classes...it would have made class so much more exciting.The Other Boleyn Girl tells the story of Mary Boleyn, the often forgotten sister of the much talked about Queen Anne Boleyn, Henry the VIII's second wife (just one of six!!). The story begins with Mary's family pushing her into the King's bed, even though she is a married woman. While many so that Mary was a whore and she gladly went after the King, Gregory instead portrays a woman dealing with a constant inner struggle between what she feels for her husband and for herself and what she feels for the King. In the end, family pressures get the best of her and she finds herself in an intense and oddly satisfying affair with the King.However, soon Mary's sister, Anne returns to the court and catches the eye of the King. The second half of the book centers around Anne's relationship with the King and with Mary. Mary is suddenly pushed aside as her sister quickly climbs the social Tudor ladder faster and faster eventually being crowned Queen.Upon finishing this novel, I immediately started investigating King Henry and Anne Boleyn myself. This piece of literature made a time period that I had often thought to be dull and boring, exciting and interesting to me. I recommend that anyone interested in history pick up this book and give it a try. I promise you won't be disappointed!!"

This novel is full of manipulations, political manoeuvring, deceit and heart-wrenching treachery; as the Boleyn's rise in power so to does their risk of safety and death by treason. Torn loyalties and familial affection become twisted into a grotesque mask of hatred, jealousy and spite.

Larson,1/1,5.0,1074038400,Fascinating Period Fiction,"Everyone knows the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, but this book brings these characters to life & puts a whole new perspective on this age old tale. Mary Boleyn, like her sister Anne and brother George, has spent virtually her entire life in the Royal Court, and the siblings are well educated on how to mask their inner emotions and desires with a courtiere's smile. Dominated by an ambitious uncle, they are each directed to play roles that will advance the family's status. After Mary's relatively brief affair with King Henry VIII, she is supplanted by her sister Anne, and Mary is reunited with the husband she had been married to, but separated from, since she was 12 years old. After his sudden death from disease, she meets and falls in love with a man of whom her family would never approve. Eventually, as things slowly start to disintegrate for her sister Anne, Mary finally finds the courage to separate herself from her family and leave the royal court behind to join the man she has married for love. I love reading a good historical novel, and this book was no exception. Philippa Gregory does a fantastic job of developing characters, setting, and plot to keep the reader engaged from beginning to end."

Written in first person from the prospective of Mary Boleyn who was intimate with the King years before her sister. This book tells Mary's story with is completely imeshed with her sister Anne's. The Boleyn family is portrayed in a less then golden light as the family attempts to weave themselves into court life and gain the advantage over the Seymours (ultimately failing). Anne and Mary are simply pawns in a sick and twisted game. Anne is very unlikable in this novel however, it's not clear as to rather she is more tragically a causality of her family and the times. Mary's hostility and love for her sister is as confusing and complex as any sibling relationship. I celebrate when Mary is able to find true love and break free of the family cycle... if we could all be as strong as Mary perhaps we too will live happily ever after. Enjoy!"

All historical sources agree that she was the elder daughter. That doesn't really matter to the story, so why not get it right? I was also annoyed by the portrayal of Mary as an innocent young girl when she first met Henry VIII...in fact, she had previously been the mistress of Francois I of France and had been kicked out of the French court for prostitution, which is why she returned to England while Anne remained in France. When Mary arrived at the English Court, an innocent she was NOT. I found the author's portraits of all 3 Boleyn children to be biased in the direction she wanted them to go, as opposed to being realistic based on the historical data available. The author was prone to conveniently leaving out facts that were relevant to the story but did not support her simplistic view of each character. Anyone who has read historical accounts of these characters and times will be severely disappointed in this book. I only hope that the general public does not mistake this book for history."

The apparent factual inaccuracies noted by other readers takes something away from it, as I think it shows a lack of respect for the history. However the story is fascinating and most of the characters wonderfully textured (I don't agree with some that they were one-dimensional: Henry was a powerful goof, George lovably ambitious & loyal and Anne was my favourite of all; so powerful and sarcastic! She was more of a heroine than Mary for me. I wanted to be her lady in waiting!). You won't want to put this novel down. Like Henry, the Boleyns snared me too! 4 stars."

2661,0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A1DT1X5SLS69JX,RC,3/3,4.0,1276041600,"Entertaining, certainly","I found this book entertaining despite the romance novel devices. Anne Boleyn fans beware - this is not a multi-dimensional portrayal of the historical figure. This Anne is more Scarlett O'Hara or Becky Sharp - willing to use anybody and suffer anything to achieve her ambitions. She does have a few vulnerable moments that make her sympathetic occasionally, but mainly she is a foil to Mary's blondness and relative niceness (the historical Mary Boleyn's alleged sexual escapades are toned down or omitted in this novel). This Anne is far more bitchy than spiritual or charitable - but of course that's why the book is so popular. After all, several enduring novels use this classic device of one nice girl and one nasty one and the sibling rivalry makes this story all the more emotional.Mary narrates the story, so that could excuse some of the negative portrayal of Anne. They are both rivals for the king's attention and rivals for their parents' affections. The coldness of the parents and Uncle Norfolk make the closeness between the three siblings George, Anne and Mary all the more poignant. George is charming and witty in this novel, Anne is self-centered and witty, and Mary is the romantic heroine, but she is not totally likeable. Before she defies her family to marry for love, she repeatedly betrays Queen Katharine by spying on her and seducing the king right in front of her - then she grovels before Katherine and declares how much she enjoys serving her. She knows she's a little hypocrite - she repeatedly uses snake imagery to describe herself and her relatives. My favorite line is: ""George and I smiled encouragingly, the Boleyn smile: a pair of pleasant snakes.""The author used many of the more controversial theories from Retha Warnicke's biography of Anne Boleyn as historical background, rather than a more well rounded and historically accurate sampling - but it made an entertaining story. The relationship between the 3 siblings is what kept me reading: perhaps closer than is healthy, but understandable considering their awful parents. This novel should have made a great movie due to the lurid story and historical characters - it is just a shame that neither of the movies made picked up on any of George's, Anne's or even Mary's charm - that is what really makes me want to read the book again.Now for the bad. First, Some of the dialogue is incredibly annoying unless you like romance novels. The siblings repeatedly call each other ""silly whore"" and stuff like that to excess, more like modern reality show trash than young Tudor aristocrats. Second, most of the other characters are one dimensional: The family elders are all self-serving, ambitious and cold with no redeeming traits whatsoever. The king is a spoiled brat, and the queen is pious and regal, but you don't find out much about her inner mind - she is developed in another book by the author. Mary's second husband is just too good to be true: he never loses his temper, super lover, super stepfather, helps deliver his own child, etc. etc. Oh, her kids are perfect little angels too. Third, I do have a respect for history and I would have preferred a more factual story, although that didn't stop me from enjoying this book. The queen committing incest with her brother - come on, most people understand that the incest charge was always used against top ranking females when they wanted to ensure a death verdict (witness Marie Antoinette) and historians have proven to most people's satisfaction that the incest charge against Anne was trumped up. I think the story would have been just fine without that prurient scene, since not very believable in fact.All in all, a very enjoyable story if read purely as entertainment."

White ""Medical Librarian""",3/3,3.0,1225065600,Worth reading once,"You've got to find this book appealing because of the time period it covers - the early Reformation. It was a time of great upheaval in the Church, and many Europeans were forced to re-examine their core beliefs about papal supremacy, the authority of God's word, and the sanctity of marriage. In such a vital, dangerous, and exciting time, two sisters from the Howard family, Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary Boleyn, emerged to become rivals for the affections of King Henry VIII.As we all know, Anne Boleyn fought her way to the throne, eventually becoming queen of England and the mother of Elizabeth I.The first thing I noticed about the book was its length of over 600 pages. Normally, I'd be wary of such a contemporary novel, as they nearly all seem to go 400 pages (frequently for no good reason); however, in this instance, I think it is necessary for Gregory to drag her story out. Even though I knew what was in store for the Boleyn sisters, I began to wonder if Anne would ever get to the throne of England in this book, and perhaps there was a sequel to the book that I just hadn't noticed. By taking the steps slowly, Gregory makes us feel all of the impatience and frustration that Anne felt, if not the desperation. So, for pacing the novel, I give the author high marks.Some readers have criticized Gregory's portrayals of the Howard family and of Anne specifically. Some call the portrayals overly negative, judgemental, harsh, and one-sided. Obviously, Gregory feels comfortable painting a heartless picture of many characters in the book, whether deserved or not (and I suspect, though I don't know, that some of her characters in her other novels suffer a similar rendering). It's Gregory's story to tell, and if she wants to pit greed and selfishness against sweetness and light (as in her characterization of Mary), then have at it, I say. As a reader, ask yourself if you would have kept turning the pages of this book given a more nuanced, historically accurate portrayal. Clearly, Gregory is very familiar with the concept of oppositional elements, and these elements combine to tell a romping good tale, one that, as the evidence shows, met a highly successful reception in Gregory's chosen market.TOBG has some rather glaring grammatical errors. For that reason, it doesn't get my highest rating. If you're not annoyed by such things, read the book. It is a work of escapism and a perfect distraction from the stress of modern life."

The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her ""cotton head"". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous.

It is a work of FICTION built upon known information and expanded to fill in what MIGHT have been going on while history was in the making.This story is based upon real people in real situations and the story line that Ms. Gregory developed is what makes the historical facts come to life. Between those facts were situations of REAL LIFE and though I am not sure that each of the characters were represented accurately (as, again, we cannot know their true personalities) they would most likely be similar to how they have been portrayed based on the results we know to be true.In any case, I learned a great deal about the lifestyles, difficulties and ambitions of the people of that time period and I think I got a true sense of what the BOLELYN'S lives were probably like...and the lives of ALL those living in the 1500's.The book did seem a bit long-winded, but in that way it did give a sense of how long and tedious a journey it was through time.In the end, the story left me more interested in the rest of English history...wondering what became of the children, how Henry moved on after Anne's beheading, etc. I realized I knew little about the line to the throne and Ms. Gregory stimulated that interest, as she probably will for any reader of this book.Find out about the little known REST OF THE STORY, the Other Boleyn Girl and their brother, as well as other assorted other historical doings and get a taste of history that may lead you to wanting to know more."

Gregory is a master at writing; take her character of Anne Boleyn for example: sometimes she was so horrible that I looked forward to her death, but at other times you can't help but feel sorry for her. I think that telling the story from the view of Mary, the &quot;other Boleyn girl&quot; and Anne's rival, was an excellent choice, as it offered great insight into a woman's life at court during the reign of Henry VIII. Yes, this story does have a lot of romance in it, but I really feel that it's tastefully done and certainly doesn't subtract from the quality. All in all, an excellent book. Highly recommended."

I don't have any issue separating and appreciating the difference between the real story (like the wonderful, ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" by Alison Weir) and the fictional adaptations like this and the movie (which are very different stories). I think it's really great when you're fascinated with an era to take on a real event that happened and try to discover what might have happened if the characters were a little different than they really were. 'What if we made it seem more possible that this happened (even if it didn't really)?' 'How would the characters react if we threw this into the mix?' 'How about if we exaggerate this character or make them more like this, just to serve this fictional story a little better?' I thought it was a great read! I particularly liked this version of Mary and her interactions with the other characters. It was terrific!"

It captivates your imagination and takes you back to the days at the Englishg courts where King Henry the VIII rules and the Boleyn girls play a game of ambition,love, and desire for the throne.The narrator of the novel is the young Boleyn girl, named Mary, whom immediately catches the wandering eyes of a king, desperate for an heir, as soon as she arrives to court.With its twists and sudden turns the plot thickens ever so deep as soon as Mary is bumped out of the Kings vision and is replaced with Mary's older sister, Anne.Now that each sister clearly is envious of the other and that the desperate Boleyn family desires at least one of their daughters to assume the throne as soon as Queen Katherine, Henry's wife, croaks, the powerful Uncle of Mary and Anne blatantly decides Mary and Anne's fate for them.Mary, becoming quite lonely, for her family's attention is set upon Anne's happiness, falls in love with a man, named William, who is a mere servant for her Uncle, but she follows her heart for the first time in her life and marries whom she really loves despite the consequences and the wrath of her sister, Anne.It is quite clearly the story about Anne's rise and her sad and unexpected fall through the eyes of her sister Mary. And it shows the importance of family, for even though they grow terse and cruel towards each other, they are always there for one another when in need.With all this stories strong points the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it gets a bit frustrating while reading it. Not because it's a hard read, far from it, but because poor Mary never stands up for herself and lets herself get beat up, verbally, by her Uncle, Mother, Father, Sister, Bother, and King. You just want to reach into the book and slap some sense into her! I EXTREMELY suggest that you go out and get yourself a copy, it is truely a wonderful tale."

I grew to love most of the characters and then I grew to hate them too, especially Anne and Henry, they both turned out to be quite selfish and horrible. Mary and George were portrayed as quite human--flawed, but trying hard to be good all the same. If George was anything like the character that Philippa Gregory portrays, then I am very sorry for the way he died. I usually start a story, get bored, and read the last chapter to see if I want to read the whole thing, but not with this book--I read it cover to cover.

Despite knowing how it would end, I read every page in suspense and hope for the Boleyn family. The story is still lingering in my mind while I wait for the next historical fiction novel to be delivered.The Other Boleyn Girl is narrated by Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary Boleyn, the most notorious adulteress of the time. When Queen Katherine becomes barren after not producing a male heir for Henry VIII, political families jockey for the king's favor, and the queen's crown, by manipulating the young neices and daughters of the family. As soon as she hits puberty, Mary is trapped into a life of serving the Howard and Boleyn families' ambitions for wealth and power. Intent on getting a legitimate heir for his throne and fulfilling his every desire, Henry VIII uses his supreme power to manipulate even the laws the church to get exactly what he wants. Mary, Anne, and their brother, George Boleyn are in the middle of the mayhem.

This book was wonderful. It really made you think about how cruelly women were used in the past. Mary was treated like an animal, a person without feelings, like an object. She was used as something to further her family's importance. The king's mistress at 13! And Mary really had no one's shoulder to cry on. Her sister Anne was jealous of her, her brother was nice but would have told their father or uncle. I was happy at the end where she married someone she loved, I was angry when her sister banished her from court, I felt happy when Anne finally got what she deserved. Mary didn't want much.

This fictional book is based on the true fact of Mary's affair with King Henry and the subsequent marriage of Henry and Anne as well as the beheadings of both Anne, George and half of Henry's court - The Other Boleyn girl is well written and fast paced and gives a credible and interesting back story to one of the most celebrated and notorious marriages England's history as well as bringing to light several individuals who have been relegated to the back pages of history - if they are mentioned at all.From life at the court to life in the fields, The Other Boleyn girl has it all, love, adventure and intrigue.

As a lover of historical novels, I was curious on how the author would portray the famous Anne Boleyn. To my disappointment, she was one-dimensional and flat - like all the other characters in this book.I understand that there are historical inaccuracies or distortions in such a book in order to make the plot flow or more interesting to readers. Fine, I accept them because this is a historical FICTION, not a history textbook.However, to make the characters in the story either vicious and evil or virtuous and kind, made the plot tiring to read and to accept. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a selfish and manipulative woman, at times so psychotically unhinged and unreasonable that I found her character to be laughable. On the other hand, we have her sister Mary Boleyn - that poor, innocent girl used by her scheming relatives to attain wealth and status. The author wants readers to love her, to sympathize with her - but I am sorry to say that I could not. She narrates this entire story from the age of 13 to her twenties and sadly, her character's voice does not mature or grow up. She was still the naive and wanton teenager at the age of twenty, with just the addition of various proclamations of love to her kids. Also, I found her thought process fragmented and just plain weird because at one point, she hates her sister to the extent where she wishes her death and then at the next moment, she's all best friends with her. I mean, what? Other characters are also this poorly constructed and unbelievable - from the almost saintly Queen Katherine to the lurker-like, nosy-to-the-point-of-wanting-to-harm-her-own-husband's reputation Jane Parker.The prose and style this book is written in is also not particularly special. Rather, her sentences are very simply constructed and at times, repetitive. I felt no emotional response at any point while reading this book because how can one feel anything when the author merely uses a sentence to describe the death of so-and-so. She 'tells' us too many things rather than showing us. Without the sexual themes, this book could be easily read by a middle school student.I can not understand why people are giving such high ratings for this book. To me, it was like reading one of those romance novels you can get at the convenience store. All I wanted to do was to chuck it out the window in between readings. This novel lacks well-developed characters (at times, I felt offended at the portrayal) and the prose is not particularly beautiful or inspiring. I suggest borrowing it from the library if you really want to read it."

The story is told by Anne's younger sister, Mary Boleyn, who was married off at the age of 13, became the king's mistress until he lost interest in her, and then after many years of being a pawn in her family's ambitious plan to rise to power, whatever the cost, began to make her own decisions.Anne and Mary were both beautiful young women who were members of a powerful family that felt it could never have too much power or too much wealth. It was fascinating to read about the choices each of these women made along the way, and where their choices led them. It was also eye opening to read about what life was like for women in the 1500s.The English court during Henry VIII's reign is a poignant reminder of what can happen when corruption and abuse of power dominate, no one is safe.Even if you're not someone who typically reads historical fiction, read The Other Boleyn Girl.

Since I read this book I have had trouble getting into other books because they seem so much less. From the first page I was hooked and drawn into the story. The characters were stongly developed and I found myself sharing their emotions and thoughts. I could not put the book down, I finished it in two days and was sad to come to the end. I cheered for Mary, wished ill to Anne and sympathized with Mary's first husband who was cast aside. It was a side to Tudor history that I have never faced for little is mentioned about Mary in other books, except to make her seem like a trashy plaything for the King.

I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time!Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as ""He was executed the next day."" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it?In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said ""stuff"" back then, for example, as in, ""All this stuff is making me mad."" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect. If you're like me and want to learn something in the process, however...As I've made obvious, I was sorely disappointed. Just thought I'd pass my warning along.

They don't teach you about Anne's sister, Mary, in high school history class. Immediately I was hooked on this novel. Though obviously fictional, Gregory does a great job of getting most of the background about the time period correct. She is a master story-teller and her prose just draws you in. I found myself rushing home from work so I could get back to my book! I thought all of the characters were quite believable, except maybe Jane Parker, and I sympathized with Mary and Queen Katherine. Some of the other reviewers seemed to be put off by a few inaccuracies, but I think if the reader looks at this as a work of fiction influenced by the time period, they will not be bothered, and probably won't even notice. I know I didn't. Also, to address the issue of George's homosexuality, Gregory DOES speak to this in the back of the novel in the interview section. She says that there is a school of thought that believes this theory and that is the one she chose to base that storyline on. I felt she explained herself rather well. Anyways, buy the book, it will keep you up at night wanting to know what will become of poor Mary and her corrupted family."

Holmes,0/0,5.0,1184284800,Review of THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL,"I really appreciate a book, especially historical fiction, in which an author painstakingly researches the material. You could tell by the writing of Philippa Gregory that she is an expert when it comes to the matters of King Henry VIII and his court. This expertise of the author makes the story much more enjoyable and believable. Her writing and descriptions in this book are incredible. She definitely has a grasp of the English language. You will understand what I mean when you read this book.This is definitely a ""chick book"" but I read it anyway because I enjoy history and stories of the kings and queens of Europe. I have to admit that I was never once bored with this book throughout the entire 661 pages. The story moved fast and the events took place one right after the other. The cool thing was that I really had feelings for the characters which is always important to me when I read a book. In this book I felt for the characters, some I loved and some I despised. And I found them believable as well.There are plenty of other great reviews on here that can tell you what this book is specifically about, but in one sentence it is simply a book about two sisters competing for the love of the king. I am very surprised to have liked it as much as I did.A quick warning to parents who may be deciding if there kids or young teenagers can read this book: there are some very graphic sexual depictions in this book. I would read it prior to them to decide."

I have stuck with mostly Italian in the past, but this was a very exciting ""jump"" into British historical fiction--specifically the CRAZY world of the Tudors and Henry's 6 wives.I was totally enthralled with this book--but not until around page 200. So the first bit I was having a hard time buying into it because I thought Mary was kind of annoying and weak. But as the book progresses, she ages (obviously) and her relationship with Anne, the Boleyn family, the King, and pretty much everyone around her is really fascinating. She finally grows some ""balls"" and you're rooting for her to escape the treachery of the Boleyn family and FIND LOVE. It sounds cheesy here but there is seriously nothing cheesy about this book.I know that I love a book when I'm constantly looking up the history in encyclopedias and finding other books in this area. I was a little disappointed to hear that there really isn't much documented history pertaining to Mary in real life, but from what I have read (very VERY preliminary), Gregory is right on and has solid backing for what she has written. Also, I am very impressed with historical fiction writers who use the actual historical character as the center of the story versus using a fictional character and having things happen around them.

And since most all history is written by men -- the men who are the victors -- I found it fresh, gripping and entertaining to imagine Mary Boleyn's life.As often the best cinema does not distract the viewer with special effects or other cinematic devices, so it is with Ms. Gregory's seamless writing. Her words are so well woven I almost forgot that I was reading fiction. I almost forgot that I was reading altogether, I was so transported. A reader cannot do much better!"

In particular, this book deals with Mary and Anne Boleyn, two sisters who could not be more different in looks and personalities. They are Boleyns due to their father's side and Howards due to their mother's. Anne is the dark-haired, seductive beauty who marries the king and is later executed for witchcraft and adultery. Mary, the younger, fairer Boleyn sister, is actually the girl who starts the Boleyn chapter in English history. Mary, married at a young age, catches Henry's eye with her pretty fair looks and charm, and her relatives, the Howard family, seize the opportunity to make Mary Henry's mistress and to glorify the Howard/Boleyn names. Even after conceiving two beautiful children, Mary does not achieve a higher status other than the king's mistress, so Anne takes her place. Anne, with her deadly ambition, is determined to outshadow her fortunate sister and leave her mark in history. The king divorces his faithful but barren Spanish wife of many years and breaks from the Roman Catholic Church so he can marry Anne, and she will do anything, even go to the gates of Hell, to bring a son for the sake of the English throne.Meanwhile, Mary, no longer the Howard favorite, discovers the simple pleasures of life on a farm, and she decides to follow her heart for once and marry her true love. However, she is forced to watch the poignant rise and fall of her best friend and rival, Anne, in the whimsical English court. Anne is constantly kept on her toes, both literally and figuratively, to please the king. Henry acts like a spoiled child who will stop at nothing when he wants something, especially that something being a legitimate son to the throne, and one wrong dance move means certain death.This book wonderfully illustrates the deadly ambition that seizes many families like the Howards and turns the daughters and sons into mere pawns of an intricate game. Some of them escape alive, like Mary and her children (and her new husband), but others like Anne end up greeting the scaffold and not leaving it alive. The Other Boleyn Girl shows the whims of love and lust; Mary eventually discovers true love (to my joy), and she is the only fortunate member in the Boleyn/Howard families, as her brother bitterly notes. I love the magic and the suspense of the book. It is one of the few books I have stayed up many nights in a row, sacrificing precious hours of sleep, just so I could finish reading it. Philippa Gregory blends historical fact and fiction so well; she truly makes Mary, an obscure character in English history, come alive. Although this book is about 700 pages long, it is a true page-turner that keeps the reader wanting more."
2721,0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A2OAD5Y7MXUOFZ,Laurie A. Brown,0/2,5.0,1287964800,The lesser known Boleyn was the nicer one,"Most people know that Anne Boleyn was the second wife of England's King Henry VIII, but few have heard of Mary Boleyn- the other Boleyn girl. Anne's sister (historians disagree as to whether she was older or younger) played on the stage of the Tudor court, yet has been mostly forgotten as she was never queen and died of natural causes.As a female member of the Boleyn and Howard families, Mary was a pawn to be used for gain, her own feelings and wants to be ignored. Married at 12 to William Carey, at 14 Mary caught the eye of the philandering king- then wed to Katherine of Aragon- and was his mistress for several years, bearing two children in the process. While laying in to have her second child, her sister Anne seduced the king, reserving only her (questionable) virginity, which she withheld for a promise of marriage and queenship. As we all know, that marriage and queenship was short and unhappy and ended with Anne's head removed from her body.This novel, told from the point of view of Mary Boleyn Carey, is a story that blends the false glitter of the court with strong family ties- ties of both obedience and of love. Mary loves her sister Anne but is also jealous of her- they are constant rivals at everything. Anne is her beloved sister but Anne is a user, someone who never looks at a situation without wondering how she can turn it to her advantage and humans-including family- are disposable. She learned this from her parents, who taught their children- including brother George- well. Their parents care not what happens to their children, as long as they are advanced at court and made wealthy.In this telling, Mary is less driven than Anne or George and more in touch with her moral side. She sleeps with the king because her parents tell her to, while questioning the propriety of betraying both Queen Katherine and her own husband. She asks for presents for her family at their behest. She gives up her place as mistress and aids her sister's ascension despite having come to love the king. She teaches her sister sexual tricks to hold the king and helps her hide miscarriages. She hides the secrets of the family, secrets that are punishable by death.But she finally rebels and makes a life for herself, marrying for love. Not long after, the Boleyn web of secrets falls apart and we all know how that story ends. Mary alone lives on, and historical record seems to point to a happy, if short, life after that.This book takes some liberties with history but I'm willing to forgive it. Gregory brings the era and the court to brilliant, vivid life. Somehow she manages to get the reader to care about these people, not just Mary (although she comes off best) but the avaricious Anne and George, and even the petty, selfish, childish king Henry. These characters are fleshed out, with the contradictions of spirit that we all have. I loved this book."

Wright ""A Modern Bibliophile""",1/1,5.0,1242432000,Fascinating!,"The Other Boleyn Girl tells the notorious story of Henry VIII and his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn, from the perspective of his mistress, Anne's sister Mary Boleyn. The novel begins with the execution of the Duke of Buckingham in 1521 and ends with the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536. The story itself is rather well known to even casual history readers, but Philippa Gregory makes the story intriguing by telling us what went on behind the scenes.I found this book to be enchanting, enthralling and difficult to put down. As it is put forth as historical fiction, and not a text book, I did not read it with an encyclopedia on hand to detect historical inaccuracies. I don't think that we should negatively critique fiction because of liberties taken with the story. Yes, Gregory puts a decidedly sensationalist construction on the famous story, and her choice to use the lesser known Mary Boleyn as the narrator means that a lot of the story can't be verified. But I didn't care about any of this when I was reading. Instead, I found myself swept away into another time and place - Tudor England was truly brought alive in Gregory's thorough description of the places and atmosphere of England under Henry VIII's rule. It is a riveting story of love, scandal, ambition and sibling rivalry at its worst. I devoured it in a few days and I've already moved on to The Boleyn Inheritance.The best part of the book for me was the fascinating development of Mary Boleyn as a character. At the beginning of the novel she is a slightly idealistic 13 year old girl forced into a marriage and later into an affair with the King of England. Through heartbreak, loss and betrayal, she develops into a courageous woman who makes the choice to rebuff her powerful family and marry a man of her choosing. The scenes between Mary and William Stafford are breathtakingly romantic and beautiful.This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read in a long while. I enjoyed it from beginning to end and recommend it to all historical fiction lovers. Enjoy!!"

Rich characterization of the members of the Boleyn family and King Henry VIII's court, rich descriptions of the life of the courtiers (full of pettiness, social climbing, gossip, scheming and intrigue) , and vivid explorations of the circumstances of Anne Boleyn's scheming rise and abrupt, precipitous fall, seen through the eyes of her sister Mary, all combine to make an absorbing and entertaining read. When finished reading, I felt, ""It definitely really could have happened exactly that way.""

From the first page of this book to the very last this book kept me interested, awake, and well-immersed in the Tudor courts. I may only be in middle schoolbut I have read many adult books, mostly historical fiction, and this is one of the best I have ever read. Sure, this may be historically inaccurate at some parts (like the age difference in this book goes Anne is the oldest, then their brother, then Mary when in real life it went Mary, Anne, and their brother) but it is still a good read, a very interesting read, and a very needed record of the forgotten Boleyn girl who bore Henry two children and was his first mistress who established the Boleyns at court. Anne is shown in the light she should be told in this book: power hungry, beautiful, a devoted girl to her closest of friends, and simply someone who wanted to make it in the world but went too high and was brought down. Mary will be sympathized in the book and may seem a little whiny at times but you will be scared, happy, upset, and carefree along with her through all the chapters. I recommend this book to all people from 9th Grade+ because of the adult references and I am sure you will enjoy it no matter how inaccurate it may be and how girly it can be.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, from minute to end. In fact, I couldn't put it down. Despite the novel being pretty lengthy, I finished it in two days.It gives a very detailed, fascinating glimpse of life at one of the most famous courts in history. Although yes, ill say it is very dramatic (pretty much an old-fashioned soap opera). Nonetheless, its beautifully written, so much so that you can feel yourself going back in time, and imagine yourself at the court, amongst the characters.Since reading this book, I have read several other novels having to do with this time period, a majority of them having to do with Anne Boleyn (one of the main characters in ths book). To me she is the most interesting of all the wives of King Henry VIII. Which leads me to the one thing I must say that I didn't like about this book....the way that Anne Boleyn was potrayed.

She also has a King edition as well, I just haven't gotten around to that one yet. But back to The Other Boleyn Girl, I like that Ms. Gregory wrote the book in the voice of Mary Boleyn, whom you never hear about. The absolute determination of Anne and her family contrasted by Mary's desire for a simple quiet life is what makes the story so fantastic. I have just started the second Boleyn book, The Boleyn Inheritance, which looks into how the women after Anne where effected by the damage that was done by the Boleyn family, so far, so good."

I think Anne would be horrified, disgusted and offended if she knew how modern novelists, such as Gregory, portray her. What irritates me is exactly what Alison Weir has pointed out - history in the Tudor period was so fascinating, you couldn't make it up, so why do people invent things when surely Anne's story is fascinating enough anyway?This book is also a monstrous betrayal of Mary Boleyn, and George. Mary would probably be mortified to see that she is portrayed as nothing more than a naive whore, when Weir's research disputes that and suggests that she was in reality unlucky, whereas there is no evidence that George was homosexual. Philippa Gregory has disgraced the name of the Boleyns. Let us also not forget her horrible depiction of Jane Boleyn in ""The Boleyn Inheritance"". And I'm quite sure Katherine Howard would not appreciate being presented as a sex-mad bimbo when she was more probably naive than anything else. Disgraceful."

To me, there are two types of books: page turners and books that move very slowly but have a lot of substance. The Other Boleyn Girl is the latter.

I've heard differing opinions on just how historically accurate this novel is, but in the end I think it matters little. Gregory stays close enough to the facts to be believable and ultimately it is a work of fiction.My only critique is that she works so hard at sanctifying Mary Boleyn while villifying Anne. She asserts on several occasions that Mary is as preoccupied with family and personal advancement as Anne, but the story she tells seems to indicate that Mary is an unwitting participant in all the intrigue.In the end, that one flaw vanishes in the sheer beauty and scope of the novel. It is not an undertaking for the faint of heart, at over 600 pages, but it is well worth it.

I noticed them as well. The changes in the Boleyn girls' birth order did not trouble me as much as the disputed parentage of Mary Boleyn's children (why would Henry, whose first illegitimate son he made a Duke, ignore his son by Mary Boleyn?) I also found it odd that the author seemed to give creedence not only to the charges of witchcraft against Ann Boleyn, but to the charge of incest between Ann and her brother George. These charges, which were ostensibly the reasons why Ann was beheaded, have been generally dismissed by every historian since they occurred.So why, then, did Phillipa Gregory treat them as, if not fact, then at least possibilities?This would not have bothered me at all had she included an author's note that explained her reasoning. I understand that the hints of Dark Doings and intrasibling sex make for a much more intriguing read, and if that was Ms. Gregory's intention, good for her.But why, then, would you not include something to tell your readers what liberties you've taken with the facts, and why?The fact that she did not do so is why I gave this book such a low rating.As a story, it's pretty good. A bit heavy on the purple prose, but that didn't bother me too much. The detail about life at Henry's court was quite good and the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon and Mary's guilty affection for her was touching.Is the book a tad too long? I think so. I didn't need page after page to remind me that Mary Boleyn loved farming and her children very, very much. Got it the first time. But it was an enjoyable story, and the characters were well-crafted and for the most part believable (though they veered towards charicature near the end).All in all, it wasn't bad, and I would read another book by this author. I'm merely disappointed that she took such liberties with the facts (Mary's daughter in the Tower with Ann? Huh?) and did not explain to her readers why she did so or what the truth was."

While she was recovering from childbirth, Henry turned from her to her sister, Anne.In one of the unforgettable scenes in the book, the Boleyn family calmly discusses which sister should be the one for Henry. And when it is decided it should be Anne, Mary asks, ""What shall I be?"" and the answer from Anne: ""You'll be my lady in waiting. You'll be the other Boleyn girl.""Mary always did as she was told but her real longing was to live a peaceful life in the country - far away from court - with her children. But once Anne became Henry's favorite, she controlled Mary and her children like pieces on a chessboard.Anne became very cruel. The Boleyn family was ruled by blind ambition and anything and everything they did was done to gain access to the throne. Mary was kept from her children and from the man she then fell in love with to serve Anne.One of the amazing things about Mary is she was the only one of her family who just wanted to be common. She managed to stay friends with Queen Katherine even when she had Henry's children. And when Anne and her family had completely lost favor with the King, Mary survived.An absolutely riveting book.

What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's nave and unique generosity.That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.She wants readers to get an ""insight into the psychology"" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is ""The Virgin's Lover""... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel ""The Queen's Fool"" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful ""Earthly Joys"" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)So, get ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's ""Legacy""."

This book is amazing how it portrays life in Tudor England from a less known woman, the infamous Anne Boleyn's sister Mary Boleyn. The fact that it is written from her sister's point of view is hat makes this book even more special. I think she described Anne better then if Anne had narrated the book. I literally could not put this book down! It was too good. She made an extremely creative and wonderful story."

Jaszczak ""servant of the secret fire""",0/0,4.0,1140307200,Intelligent and engrossing historical fiction,"The title of The Other Boleyn Girl pretty much says it all; it's the story of Anne Boleyn's sister Mary, who was Henry VIII's mistress before he became infatuated with Anne. The historical Mary seems to have been very different from the rest of her ambitious family, receiving virtually nothing of value from Henry herself and eventually marrying, after her first husband's death, a comparatively humble man and becoming the only one of the three Boleyn children to die in bed. In this novel, however, although she is the pawn of her family, pushed into the path of the king in her mid-teens, she is far more.In Gregory's portrayal, Mary is an extremely sympathetic character but also a flawed one. She admires Queen Katherine but betrays her not only with Henry, a situation in which she has little choice, but also in more reprehensible ways. She allows her first marriage to become all but meaningless, but eventually, after Henry leaves her for Anne, begins to feel a growing closeness to her husband and, after his death, finds the strength to defy her sister and father to marry a man she loves. Despite her sometimes bitter rivalry with Anne, Mary and her daughter are the only members of the family who defend her upon her arrest. By the end of the book, Mary has truly become her own woman and can leave the court, as well as the world stage, for a real, fulfilling life.The politics of Henry's court are also portrayed in all their sordid detail: family gatherings centering on which sister should be pushed into the king's bed and how to keep her there; the bribery of maids to find out whether the queen has had her period and the secret disposal of miscarried babies; the pimping of his own sisters by their brother George, who has his own shameful secret; the intrigues of councilors and churchmen to achieve the king's desires and their own ambitions. Yet for the most part, these people are portrayed as living human beings, not angels or monsters.My main quibble with this book, and the reason it doesn't rate five stars with me, is its portrayal of Anne Boleyn. Gregory gives a realistic picture of her charm, drive, and relentless ambition to become queen, but other aspects of her character are not delineated as well. When she falls in love with Henry Percy (son of the Earl of Northumberland, not the Duke), I find it hard to believe, although Gregory obviously means for it to be a real passion that affects the course of Anne's life. Also, even though Mary mentions her (Anne) reading theology with the king as well as her wit, I never get a sense of her real intelligence or of a personality behind the obsessive ambition.On the whole, however, I recommend this book very highly; despite its almost 700 pages it only took me a few days to get through it and I enjoyed it immensely."

Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."

There is a limit as to how far a novelist can stretch the truth while writing historical fiction, and Gregory went too far. It is clear that Gregory did hardly any research on Anne Boleyn's character (as is evidence by the fact that she did not even consult THE biography on Anne, Eric Ives's book) and instead was too concerned with making Mary Boleyn out to be more important than she actually was to English history. Gregory unfortunately just reiterated the slanders that Anne Boleyn's character incurred after her execution by her Catholic enemies. It is sad that an author today could do so much disrespect to a historical figure in one novel. Furthermore, she cites Retha Warnicke's research as being her primary basis for the novel, yet after Warnicke heard this, she publicly distanced herself from the novel--mainly because Gregory misinterpreted Warnicke's theories completely. In my opinion, Gregory may as well have made up characters and kept the story she wrote, because she completely changes the personalities of these figures as we know them from the years of reasearch done by actual historians. I am all for using creative license to ""fill in the gaps"", but Gregory uses far too much license in this book, and instead changes the facts for her own interest--in order to make Anne appear as the horrible, manipulative sister, while Mary is an innocent victim of Anne's wrath. It is proposterous. For example, Gregory completely ignores Mary's behavior in France before she joined the Tudor court. Historians are pretty certain that she slept with the King of France, as well as others, during her time there. Gregory chooses to believe that Mary is a virgin when she comes to Henry, just to make her appear more innocent. Another example is Anne making Henry Carey her ward. She did this because Mary did not have enough money to give Henry a proper education, so Anne was helping her, and actually did an extremely nice thing by giving him such a good education. Gregory spins this to make it seem like Anne is stealing Henry from Mary--a ridiculous notion and quite the opposite of what actually happened.Besides the switching around of facts, the book isn't even very well written. The characters are very black and white, as is true in most of Gregory's novels (one woman=good, other woman=bad). I would not recommend this book to anyone.. if I could give it a 0 star review, I would have."
2758,0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A1YIYOAUTKQE6,Rachel,15/17,1.0,1219881600,"Atrocious, unpleasant hatchet-job","Historical fiction is a favourite guilty pleasure of mine, and I came to this book with no pre-conceptions; in fact, I actually expected to like it. Unfortunately, and many reviewers have said it more eloquently than I, TOBG is poorly-written, vulgar and offensive on a number of levels. It is reminiscent of self-indulgent internet fanfic, where the only constructive criticism received must have been along the lines of ""Soooo need more!!1!!!"" I am still mystified as to how it even got published in its current form.I get that this is historical _fiction_, and that that means an author is free to make up details as he or she sees fit. Of course, one can never expect complete accuracy; I am pretty tolerant of historical errors and literary licence, provided that these are acknowledged and disclosed to the reader. I've enjoyed numerous historical novels, most of which could never be regarded as classic literature or accurate, but which bring to life the era and the personalities vividly. I did not expect the definitive biography of Anne and Mary Boleyn by any stretch of the imagination. What I did expect though was at least an attempt at treating the characters with a modicum of respect and remaining true as far as possible to what we know about them, as well as a gripping and enjoyable story. TOBG provided neither.This author claims to be a ""feminist historian."" However there is nothing ""feminist"" about the portrayal of the women here, in fact like a previous reviewer, I think it's bordering on misogynist: Mary and Anne are reduced to one-dimensional representatives of the ""Madonna/whore"" stereotype, with Mary being the ultimate Mary Sue, embodiment of all that is pure and virtuous (complete with some 21st century attitudes about marrying for love), and Anne a vicious, megalomaniacal, amoral troll with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Mary's reputation - which comes to us from contemporary accounts - as a good-time girl of the French court is completely whitewashed over; in this universe, she is a sweet, innocent teenager when she becomes Henry VIII's mistress. There's no sign of Anne Boleyn, the cultured, very well-educated, multilingual Renaissance lady and Queen, who produced the great Elizabeth I and during her lifetime, patronised the arts, generously dispensed charity and was deeply interested in religious reform, to name just a few things.This novel does both of these women, as well as the other characters, a disservice with this flat, caricatured portrayal. There is no light and shade, no complexity; in fact, some of the characterisations are completely implausible. The dialogue is frequently anachronistic, the prose is often turgid and heavy-handed - Gregory tells, rather than shows - and I found myself skim-reading a lot of it just to finish it. The language evokes little sense of the period, with characters being attributed with modern attitudes and opinions. It takes some doing, but TOBG manages to turn interesting, dramatic and complex events into a dreary, tedious family soap opera, with a substantial dose of gratuitous and disturbing sleaze.Fiction dealing with people who really existed is tough to write, as I believe there is a responsibility to remain as close to the facts as we know them as possible; one must have very good reason to diverge from the accepted historical record. This means researching the era and the personalities almost as thoroughly as one would a biography. As other reviewers have pointed out, Gregory's research - if the listed bibliography is all that was consulted - appears shoddy at best: she ignores the definitive biography of Anne Boleyn by Eric Ives, for example. Some of the plot elements are so removed from the historical record (let alone basic human psychology) and thus so implausible that it is hard to take the novel seriously. Mary becoming Henry's mistress at 13 - why make her so young? Anne marrying Henry Percy? Being sent to France as ""punishment""? Henry VIII fathering both of Mary Boleyn's children? The Boleyn parents effectively being pimps for their daughters? Anne seducing Henry away from her sister? ""Stealing"" or ""abducting"" Mary's son to establish him as a ""potential Tudor-Boleyn heir""? George Boleyn sleeping with Francis Weston (this element did nothing to advance the story whatsoever, and seemed to be included for the sake of it) but also happens to be sexually attracted to his sister ... and acts on it? Mark Smeaton being _ Weston_'s musician? Deformed incest babies? The list goes on. Sorry, just no.Again, an author is entitled to take liberties and deviate from the historical record for dramatic purposes, but here, there is no disclosure that this has occurred; in fact, there has been repeated insistence to the contrary. Further, it is difficult to see how the plot and the central themes of the novel would have suffered had some of the above elements been accurate.This would have been a far better novel had it focused on purely imaginary characters, set in Tudor times. The same themes could have been explored just as effectively had the protagonists been say, two fictional noblewomen vying for the attention of the Duke of Whatevershire, and there is no restriction on how the personalities are portrayed or the course of events.I respect the fact that many readers have enjoyed this novel for what it is, but I sincerely hope those whose interest in the period has been sparked by TOBG will go beyond this frankly bizarre alternate universe and sketchy bibliography, and discover the fascinating story of the _real_ Anne Boleyn. Excellent non-fiction sources include Ives' ""The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn""; and Antonia Fraser and David Starkey's works on the six wives. As for novels about Anne Boleyn - although dated, the best I've found are probably those by Margaret Campbell Barnes (""Brief Gaudy Hour"") and Jean Plaidy (""Murder Most Royal"")."

Gregory is able to engage the reader with a solid voice with the main character Mary Boleyn to the infamous Anne Boleyn. The heroine, Mary has her faults and her positive traits that allows her to be a well rounded character.She is thrust into the bed of King Henry the VIII after it is learned that the Queen and him fear they will never bear a male heir. You will notice that Gregory excels at displaying the status of women as pawns during this time period through Mary's explanation of events. She was recently married to a courtier, but it hardly mattered as the Boleyn and Howard family (Mary's mother belonged to the powerful Howard family) cared first and foremost about their advancement in the court and their female daughters were merely pawns in this game.Mary falls in love with the King, but everything goes awry. She gives him two children, but King Henry is fickle and starts to lose interest when the family throws Anne into the mix ensuring that he keeps himself interested in a Boleyn girl, any Boleyn really.What happens after the failed extra marital affair is where the story truly begins. Mary at one point attempts to rekindle her relationship with her husband, but the fates have other plans in store for her. When she finally finds love, it becomes one of the best moments in the novel. He is simple, stoic, neither flashy nor grand and offers Mary the one thing she desires most and that is independence and an identity, which she wasn't afforded being a Boleyn sister.It's difficult to see how Mary wants to be loyal to the Queen, but is forced to betray her due to the hold that her family has on her. Even her depiction of Anne's ascension to the throne is enough to make one shudder. The historical theories that are inserted are believable and the historical setting is seen as a backdrop, a detail, not something to become fixated and lecture the reader on. Any event of significance or social custom is slyly introduced so that the flow of the story is not broken.This book is a must read for historical readers, readers who seek a strong female voice (with flaws mind you), and those who mistakenly saw the movie, before reading the book.

Becker ""sminismoni""",3/4,4.0,1127260800,Fact and fiction blend seemlessly,"Most fans of historical fiction are probably familiar with the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. His divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and the events leading to Anne's execution have been dramatised many times. But not much is known about Anne's younger sister Mary, who is known to have interested Henry well before these events.""The Other Boleyn GIrl"" is told from Mary's point of view, and highlights the cut-throat atmosphere of the Tudor court. Once her family realise that Mary has caught the King's eye, they instruct her on every move, hoping that the king's affection will translate into positions, titles and power. And when Anne eventually fascinates Henry even more, they plainly discard Mary to back her more ambitious sister.But the book deals with Mary's feelings as well. We watch her grow from a girl who is married off at 13 to someone she barely knows, to a teenager smitten with the attentions of a powerful sovereign. Eventually she becomes a mother and finds love with a simple country man. But even so, her personal life is forever at the mercy of the changeable court, and so often she must drop her personal concerns to aid her family retain power, a job she doesn't relish.Since there is little historical fact known about Mary Boleyn (it isn't even sure when she was born), Philippa Gregory has chosen a protagonist who is involved with interesting actual events, but can be conveniently moulded to fit the form of fiction. So beware, not all you read about Mary and Anne may be strictly true. But the story is constructed so well, and the writing so entertaining, that I wasn't even concerned by the parts I knew weren't correct.This is good quality historical fiction which I recommend to any lover of the genre. Enough of the book is based on fact, so the educated reader doesn't feel duped, and the fictional parts blend seemlessly. Not to mention, they make this book a dramatic and entertaining read which I had trouble putting down."

It's very readable, accessible style allows the reader to easily dive into early 16th century England.

Anne Boleyn's rise and fall is one of the great, intriguing stories of English history, and Philippa Gregory does it ample justice. An extra spin and spice is gained by viewing events through the eyes of Mary, Anne's sister and predecessor in sexual intrigue with Henry VIII.Gregory's portrayal of life in an ambitious, rapacious family is vivid and chilling. Mary Boleyn is ambivalent about the costs of her family's high ambition but absolutely vulnerable to its every demand. It says much about Gregory's persuasiveness as a storyteller that Mary remains a sympathetic figure even as she participates in schemes that run counter to her own conscience.Regarding the assertions that Gregory gets her historical facts wrong, it should be noted that recent scholarship does indeed place Anne as the elder sister and Mary the younger (the birth order used by Gregory).There is no contemporary record as to when either Boleyn girl was born. However, the family's decision to send Anne -- not Mary -- to be educated abroad at the court of Margaret, regent of the Netherlands, is cited by recent biographers as important evidence that Anne must have been the elder sister: ""By contemporary custom, the younger child would not have been favored with such a splendid opportunity to the detriment of her older sister..."" (Anne later spent additional time abroad at the court of France.)Mary Boleyn was the first sister married, something that would normally indicate she was the elder sister. But Anne was still abroad at the time, and her family may have been hoping for a more splendid match for her with a European nobleman. There is also evidence that the Boleyns were trying (ultimately without success) to betroth Anne to the heir of the earl of Ormond. Both circumstances would explain why they were willing to defer the marriage of an elder daughter and go ahead with an advantageous, though not as splendid, union for their younger girl. These observations come from Retha Warnicke's scholarly study of Anne's life, which Gregory cites as one of her major sources.Sorry if I made eyes glaze over with all this, but it really is unfair to assert that Gregory (whose books are in general distinguished by careful craftmanship) fouled up her facts or distorted them for the sake of a better story. She definitely makes artful conjectures -- impossible to avoid with subjects of whom very few hard facts are known. But her conjectures fall within a solid historical framework.If you enjoyed Gregory's fluid, page-turning touch in this book, take a look at some of her other historical fiction, such as her ""Wideacre"" trilogy."

I don't usually go for historical fiction since history is usally dry and fiction is not meant to be taken as more than creative license. But Phillip Gregory has blended both mediums masterfully. I found using Mary as the narrator, the infamous Anne Boleyn's sister very clever since so much is historiclly documented about Anne and very little is actually known about Mary. We are told that Anne is older and was sent to be trained in the French court and that Mary is the younger sister being married at aged 12 and placed as Queen Katherine's lady in waiting. I have always found Anne Boleyn's tale fascinating.Gregory is not a historian, so if she erred somewhat on the order and dates of some of the demises of the famous clergy or wars, so be it. At times I forgot I was reading fiction I got so caught up in the political intrigue and the Howard family's lust for power at the expense of their own kin. Her portrayal of George Boleyn was very colorful though there is no way to know if the allegations of him being homosexual or whether he actually did engage in incest to help his sister Anne beget a son to save her posisiton are true. The sibling rivalry between Anne and mary plays true. Anne uses her sister so meanly in her asirations to become queen, yet Mary is still supportive of her sister to the very end as Anne falls from grace and is executed.We see Mary, who truly cares for the king being pushed by her family to keep the interest of the king for their selfish rise in power and then callously pushed aside by both the king and her family when neither have further use for her. While Anne is ruthless, and self serving, Mary matures and eventually develops the courage to take control of her life by marrying the man she loves and defying her overbearing family. I recommend this book this anyone who is drawn to this famous period of history and wants to see it ""come alive"" in print."

As for the book itself, I was glad to be done with it. The characters had no development and seemed very one-dimensional. There were too many scenes that seemed redundant and too many conversations that kept reiterating the same points over and over. As a reader, I wished the author had respected me enough to allow me to make my own conclusions instead of beating me over the head with hers. How many times do you need to read about the treatment of the Boleyn girls by their family to grasp that they were a commodity rather than human beings? I got it the first time. All the other references to the same point felt slightly insulting.I liked the details of life in court: dresses, fashion, political events and developments in the background. I did not like that each main character represented ONE personality trait: Anne is an embodiment of blind ambition, Mary is the obedient female, George is a calculating, spineless brother, uncle and father (interchangeable, by the way) together represent the dominating, heartless male, and mom is a cold witch whose character is so underdeveloped it's hard to picture her altogether.In the end, the book felt like a dessert you eat because it's there, not because it's irresistible or worth the calories."

I enjoyed all four of the preceding novels. Therefore, I forsook my '39 page rule' (if the author hasn't hooked me by the 39th page, I give the book away.) I expected that in almost 800-pages, Ms. Jean would get around to introducing new concepts, new cultures, new `happenings', or new stuff. But *SoS* turned into a repetitious travelogue of *Plains of Passage*. It is long, ponderous, dull, and boring!I was astounded when I noticed that this is review #756, and the average rating is 2.5 stars. Look at the bell-shaped curve of 1 and 2 star reviews predominating, tapering to the least amount of 5 and 4 star reviews.The story dies after page 200, the author seemingly tired of writing the book and proceeded to pad it with 570 more pages of repetitive recollections from past novels instead of finishing it off in 400 pages. Perhaps Ms. Auel was paid by the word!But I kept plugging away, getting more and more upset at Ms. Auel for explaining almost everything repeatedly--the long-winded name introductions; the stories of finding and domesticating her animals; the customs of the Clan, how much an angry Brukenval looked like her old tormenter Broud. Even the `sharing Pleasures' parts were repetitious. And when the `The Mother's Song' was repeated for the 17th time, I almost gagged.What's also bad about this mammoth effort is that nothing happens. No new inventions and no new places (other than some under-described caves and cave paintings). She introduces new characters, but most are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The ones who do show some promise--like Brukenval, or Larimar the brewer, Echozar of the mixed spirits, or even the ponderous Zenandoni are neglected, under-described, or under-utilized. Auel prefers her repetition to fleshing out these characters, creating interest, and advancing the story line.In the previous novels Ayla and Jondalar were responsible for most of the technological and philosophical advancements of humankind to that point: the spear thrower, use of flint and steel in starting fires, the sewing needle, domestication of the wolf and horse, the horse halter, the travois, human genetics theory (Ayla's theory of mixed spirits), and where babies really do come from. In *SoS*, Ayla and Jondalar invent nothing, go almost nowhere, and do little except share Pleasures, get mated and have a baby. Oh yeah, I forgot. Jondalar's Mom does invent weaving.There are no major threats from nature, animals or people; no clash of cultures. Just flares of Cro-Magnon temper and different opinions on the nature of `flatheads'.For almost 800 pages I kept waiting for something to happen, for Durc to show up at the head of The Clan. For a blizzard, a flood, a plague or earthquake. Another adventure or trip somewhere would have been nice. There wasn't even the trademark Auel anthropological monograph on how to make a flint axe head, basket or garment.I'll probably get suckered into the next/last book in the series if she ever completes it. But first I'll read the Amazon reviewers opinions and if it is recommended by you, I will rigorously apply my 39-page rule."

I understand the concept of leave them wanting more... but I would have liked to get a few of the book' issues resolved in the 700+ pages. By the time I was at the end of the book, I felt that there was still so much story to tell...As I was preparing for the release of book 5 I did refresh my memory regarding the storylines of the other 4 books. I am sure any other fans did the same. Most of the repetition was not necessary. I got tired of reading the repetitive sections of the story and found that I was skimming the text until I got to something new... although I think that I too may have memorized the song of the Mother. How many meetings must be chaired for there to be any action on the part of the Zelandonii regarding Ayla's ""new information"" regarding flatheads.I was very interested with the storyline between Ayla and ""The First"", I suppose it could have been resolved sooner... not much of a surprise there, especially considering her history in the previous books has been sort of leading up to this. I got rather frustrated that I was the one with the realization before Ayla. Usually she is so perceptive... maybe with others and not herself???This being said, I am still looking forward to book 6 and I hope that it will answer my questions and tie up all the loose ends in Ayla's Journey. I just hope that Ms. Auel gives me a lot more plot and a lot more credit."

This book definitely marks the ""dumbing down"" of the Earth's Children series.Reviewers have ridiculed Ayla for inventing modern civilization, but hey....someone had to create herbal tea, birth control, mouthwash and tampons!Jean Auel is no longer pretending to be a serious novelist. Ayla has become a gorgeous New Age prehistoric goddess.Regarding the sex scenes--we already knew that Jondular has a big...umm...""manhood."" Mrs. Auel describes their sexual antics in gynecological terms and that's a turn-off. Actually, their sex life has become boring and routine.And Marthona--Jondular's perfect mother--keeps her dishes and herbs on SHELVES in her stone-age kitchen. Imagine that! Her ""condo"" is as well-decorated and luxurious as any modern townhouse. And Jondular's sister is a cool teenager who likes cute guys and beautiful clothes.The book is escapist entertainment---but that's okay."

The SoS is all four books combined plus 4 days of intense details as Ayla meet the uptight Zelandonii followed by a quick skip to the Summer Meeting and then a leap to the birth with a step to the birth of Whinney's foal.The rest of the book is filled with Ms Auel's last 10 years of research of the cave system in France. In the acknowledgments at the beginning of the book she says thank you to Dr Rigaud because he proof read everything she had written about the area which was presented first and then it sounds like she filled in the rest of her Geological and Anthropological thesis with a couple of cardboard characters to take up another 100 pages. If she isn't already, then I am sure that some august body in a museam or university will bestow a fellowship on my once favourite author for her work in this field.I am deeply disappointed in this ""story"" and think that Ayla should hightail it back to the Mamutoi as fast as Whinney can carry her. At least there she had a life worth getting up in the morning for. The brief encounter we had with the Ramudoi in The Plains of Passage was more exciting than over 700 pages with the Zelandonii. Come back Ranec, all is forgiven! Now we know why Jondalar has always been so painful. Growing up with people so set in their ways they make The Clan look advanced must have been a handicap for him.I highly recommend this book if you are studying anthropology or geology or anything to do with the Ice Age and the Dawn of Man. (Hey that would have been a better title for this book) You will not be sidetracked by a plot as there isn't one. Please Ms Auel, less research and more character please!"

""Valley of Horses"" was much the same, and completely frustrating as the author flipped back and forth between characters in true cliffhanger fashion. (I loved it.) ""Mammoth Hunters"" was filled with wonderful people who lived, breathed, and had complex relationships with each other (and the idea that Ayla might choose to stay with the Mamuti was completely believable, based on the fact her son was only a mention since the end of Book One).

If you are looking for the brilliance and creativity you found in the first four books you will be disappointed. Reading this book leaves you wondering why you had to wait so many years. It ties up what happens to Ayla and Jondalar and would have made a nice ending to the fourth book but it just is not able to stand on its own. There is a strong feeling that Jean Auel was tired and having made a nice short story suitable for lunch hour reading she reworked it using repetitive wording and other filler suitable for a high school science report to stretch the story in an effort to make it a book. There is just no meat to the story, no strong conflict, no heart wrenching decisions, just nothing to make you care about the characters. Fans will be disappointed in this story but at least it gives a feeling of closure, unlike the first four books this one does not leave you hungry and desperate for more. Like oatmeal when you want steak...it will fill the void but never satisfy the craving for red meat. The best I can say is that after reading this I feel indifferent when I think about the possibility of a sixth book. The addiction has been cured. Buy it and let the memories of past triumph temper your criticism for a brilliant author who has lost her way."

Rather than playing to the strengths that we saw in ""The Clan of the Cave Bear,"" i.e. an original idea couched in some impressive research, she is now resting her entire series on her weakest points: black-and-white characterization, wooden dialogue (everyone - EVERYONE - uses long, multi-clause, perfect sentences with impressive, SAT-worthy vocabulary), and pages upon pages of exposition about the tundra. I have the impression that Auel's boxed herself into a corner by her previous books, which established the precedent that Ayla is absolutely brilliant, beautiful, and perfect in every way, to say nothing of Vivid Blue Eyes. That being said, I still read the entire blasted thing, although I started skimming and skipping over large chunks about halfway through. It's worth a library checkout if you're an opportunistic glutton for a series that should have ended several books ago.If you are in the mood for some long AND excellent historical fiction, I would recommend reading Gary Jennings' ""Aztec"" or ""Raptor.""

Ayla, the prehistoric superwoman, is the first human being to domesticate animals and to discover the fire-starting properties of iron pyrite. Ludicrously, she also becomes the first to realize that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse.In short, this is not a novel; it's a National Geographic special."

Where is the tension, suspense, confrontation and all the other wonderful attributes of the other novels?SOS only seems to flaunt the wonderful things Ayla does. She can do no wrong, and she is just too perfect in this one. BORING! I think Jondalar has lost alot of his sexiness in this one. He seems to be like a lost puppy dog following Ayla around all the time. This is not the way I feel his character should be. He is a very sensitive and strong man. Where did he go?

It is building up to an encounter/clash with the Clan, just like VoH was for most of the book a buildup to Ayla and Jondalar's introduction to each other. However, unlike VoH, SoS leaves us hanging... in spite of a book that left me with sore muscles from holding it up!Now to be totally fair, the tediousness comes from getting to know yet another people - the Zelandoni. Their society is not terribly different from the Mamutoi, Sharamadoi, and all the other peoples we get to know in previous books. But they are different, and the timing of the introduction of them should have been done in VoH, or even an earlier book of Jondalar's childhood. Auel chose this way and it obviously was a difficult choice.So I guess I rate it this high because as a stabd alone book, it is not that bad. It is just kind of clunky if you are reading the series concurrently.This book is like eating your Brussell Sprouts so you can have dessert.

I am now twenty-five years old and I had given up on completely reading the series. In this span of time I have read and reread through the series. I love her books previous to Shelters Of Stone. She has always provided excellent plot, character development, excitement, and the tantalizing ""just wait for the next book"" endings. This, mixed with her amazing ability to convey the setting in a factual well-researched manner, has made me a devoted Auel fan.Over a decade I had spent reliving Ayla and Jondalar, in a limbo that I had thought would never end. Now it seems that I will continue to exist in this limbo. Jean Auel has forgotten her characters in exchange for more intimate detail of scenery, climate, and anthropology. I feel like I know these characters better than Auel does. This is not conceit, just plain commonsense. Ayla is a shadow of who she used to be. The animals are no longer character. Jondalar is just an ordinary man. I would like to ask Ms. Auel, ""Where is Ayla? Does she exist in your mind anymore, or is there only rock?"" Perhaps this seems harsh. Perhaps this could be a problem with the Publisher and Editors hounding Ms. Auel for her new book. It is easier to write a book about things than about people, especial the fictional. However, the book is not up to Auel's par. Regardless of the reason, or the quality of the settings, which are in full detail, the heart of The Earth's Children is not there."

I say this to give some means of valuation of my opinion. OK here goes. I was disappointed in the book. I cannot uderstand why it took so long to write. The book uses pages and pages of quotes (word for word) from previous books, renames charactrers that appeared in other books and presents them as new--they are not--and uses scenes and situations from previous books that are hardly reworked just name changes (the young man who is attacked and Ayla rushes to the rescue and sets the bones. Sound familiar? check Valley of Horses). Just one more example: The child that is shunned in the Mamouth Hunters is presented again in this book under a different name with a different handicap but the situation is the same. Much material in the book is repeated needlessly. The book needs a good editing. There are contridictions within this book and constridictions of material in the previous books.

With the latest book this technique has gotten unmanagable. She spent at least a third of the book going over material covered in previous books. She needs to understand that this is a series and she should assume that her readers have read the previous books.

She spent more time describing the vegetation and rock formations then she did her characters. When she finally did get around to some dialogue, more often then not, it was passages taken from her earlier books, or to recount the same stories over and over again. Gee, was that how Whinney came to be with her, oh, ok, tell it again, please, again, again, oiy!!!The characters did not mature at all, and by the end, I was hoping for an earthquake to put my out of my misery. This book had so much potential, new antagonists, past acquaintances reemerging, not to mention the dynamic duo, however, she just dropped them all in lieu of yet another verbose description of the era.

We know that Ayla will have to retell what happened to her many times, but it bored me to read it all over again and so many times. There is too much detail to things that happened in the other books, and no detail to what is happening now. And a lot goes unexplained, like why Laramar's son was injured, why was he in a fight.

Auel seems to have run low on ideas and resorts instead to recycling material from the previous books. This 5th book is particularly bad about repeating what happened in the previous 4; I got sick of Ayla re-telling some facet of her life's story to every new person she meets. Even if Auel wants to remind us of some of the other books' details, she could have done so much more succintly. Also, she is more repetitive of story ideas than ever -- Ayla heals someone to prove she's a great medicine woman, Ayla goes on a hunt, Ayla proves the value of the horses to everyone, Ayla is ostracized by some people for her Clan background, Ayla forms a special bond with someone who is crippled, blah blah... I understand a lot wasn't going on in the Stone Age, but if you have to repeat some elements of previous stories or some ideas, they certainly don't warrant the same elaboration as in previous books. It says a lot, to me, that I could read the first sentence of every paragraph and occasionally a smidge more and not feel lost in the slightest as to what was going on. Over 700 pages? Please! Less is more, Jean.With that said, I couldn't stop skimming the story. As much as I hated having to filter through this vastly over-long book (even the sex scenes were overwritten, as someone else pointed out, and how many more ridiculous euphesism can we take, really?), I became so interested in Ayla's life in the first three books that I forced myself through this 5th one as I did through the slow parts of 4 and will through 6, and I think fans will find it fun to play in the Stone Age again even if ultimately not much happens.As literature goes -- a really terribly book; as quick reads go, not the worst you could pick."

I have read the entire series over the last 1 1/2 years, so it was all fresh in my mind, and I did not find it to be a problem at all. With the amount of time between the 4th and 5th books, I would think it would have been helpful for someone who had not read the other books as recently. My first thoughts when reading a lot of the other reviews were that many of the reviewers were looking for things to find wrong with the book. (Short attention spans came to mind as well, but that's a whole different story by itself!) Could any of them honestly have written the book better? NO! I think it was very well done, and just as enjoyable as the previous 4. Of course the lives of the main characters have settled down a bit- their journey is over, they have a family now- isn't that to be expected? If I had been travelling as long and far as they had I would think my life would be more settled too! And I think if I had just arrived in a new place living with new people as Ayla had, I would probably be telling the same things over and over again just like she did in the book. I for one think the book was excellent, and I would highly recommend it."

To save you the time, here's what happens: Ayla and hubby arrive at his hometown; Ayla demonstrates all her inventions; Ayla has baby. Yes, sportsfans, that's 750 pages worth! The book is hideously repetitive. If Ayla had shown off her Thread-Puller one more time, or if she enjoyed Pleasures with Jondalar again, I think I would have tossed my cookies. I wish Auel had written instead an anthropological treatise on early human life in southern France; that's what she's really interested in anyway. Definitely pass on this one."

There was so much promise, and instead it is mostly boring, befuddled and bare of plot.It is apparent that Jean M. Auel's interest in the research behind the book overcame any desire to tell a decent story. The majority of the book merely exists to take us on a tour around the Dordogne region, and to look at the major artefacts found. Jondalar and Ayla are simply there as ""guides"". This is why we don't even get to the important aspects of the story - the matrimonial and birth - until the last quarter, and even then it seems rushed. I think it's fair to say that most readers really only care about ""what happens next"", and there's precious little of that to be had.And it's been mentioned in other reviews - the book is horrendously edited, with too much repetition and unnecessary characters. It also frustrates with the number of suggested plot lines that simply fade away with no follow up. There's a great small novel lurking amongst these 750 + pages, but unfortunately it is smothered in banality.It's a vast opportunity wasted. So many things could have happened. I waited 12 years, and I'm just so sad that this is the result. I only hope the 6th book is better."

Von Behren ""reneofc""",3/4,4.0,1314230400,Ayla Acclimates Jondalar's People,"No matter what anyone says about the Earth's Children's series--""The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One)is best,"" ""the romantic sequences are overdone,"" ""repetitious,"" ""too many anthropological and geophysical facts,""--the author, Jean M. Auel is a good storyteller. She recounts the saga of her heroine, the Cro-Magnon girl, Ayla with all the monkey-mindedness of an authentic human. In each sequence, we hear Ayla's thoughts, we understand how her brain is connecting with the current situation as it relates to other happenings in the past and because of this, sometimes redundant, style of narration, we are privy to Ayla's world in a way that few storytellers can duplicate.That is not to say that much of the criticism directed at Auel, most notably with regard to her last book of the series, ""The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),"" does not ring true. Many descriptive passages abound in all the books of the series which belie Auel's love of anthropology, however Auel's fascination with the subject might be best explored in a coffee table volume, complete with photos, that retrace the steps she took in researching the backdrop to her glacier dwelling society. For this reviewer, Auel's reliance on engaging her two lead characters, Ayla and her soon-to-be mate, Jondalar, in two-to-three page ""leg A over leg B"" sexual gymnastics every time there is a lull in the action seems almost sacrilegious and detracting to the otherwise beauty and ingeniousness of Auel's narrative. In this case, in particular, less would have been more.Auel plays with some interesting themes in ""Shelters of Stone."" However, I believe her main consideration is not a literary one. Primarily, she tells the story of Ayla from the perspective of an outsider wanting to belong to a large community of people to which she was originally born. As a character, Ayla remains steadfast to her own truth. She believes the Neanderthals or ""flatheads"" as the Zelandoni Cro Magnons call them, to be different humans, not animals. After observing wildlife during her forced isolation (The Valley of Horses (Earth's Children, Book Two)), she has come to the conclusion that it is man and not a spirit who begins life in a woman. Puzzled over her frequent fugue states where she encounters Creb, the Neanderthal who raised her, she must come to terms with what her dallying in the Spirit World tells her about herself.""Shelters of Stone,"" then, acts as an awakening of sorts for Ayla. Not only does she finally meet Jondalar's people and wow them with her animal friends, her healing abilities and her innate commonsense, she must realize that perhaps, life has something more in store for her than just a husband and babies. The moment when Ayla comes to terms with her ""calling"" and announces her decision to Jondalar brings this book of the series to its conclusion. Nonetheless, Auel wants to relate Ayla's timeline and strut her well-researched stuff rather than constructing an intricate metaphor comparing prehistoric lifestyles, sensibilities and politics to that of the present day. She does, however, underline her thinking regarding issues of ecology, discrimination and human nature all under the guise of Ayla's Zelandoni acclimation.I enjoyed this book in audio format; the reader did a fantastic job of distinguishing Ayla's ""unusual"" accent while still giving nuance to all the other characters in the story--she sounds like a Russian spy during the Cold War! Listening to the book rather than reading it meant I had to plough through the detailed lovemaking scenes that I would have ordinarily skipped. However, it also forced me to take a full accounting of all of Auel's information regarding flora, fauna and geography which greatly enhanced my understanding and appreciation for her accomplishment.Bottom line? In ""Shelters of Stone,"" Jean M. Auel furthers her telling of Ayla's history as she finally meets and joins Jondalar's family in the Ninth Cave of the Zelandoni. Auel provides her fans with more memorable moments while frequently reminding them of past experiences from the first four books and paves the way for Ayla to become something special in the eyes of those she once considered ""the Others."" Be prepared for some repetition as Auel insists on a drum roll of names and affiliations each and every time Ayla meets another member of the tribe, but don't let this detract from the human drama, of which Auel conveys very well and with no need for sophistication. As the beauteous and talented Ayla cannot help make envious enemies who attempt to foil her in whatever way possible, ""Shelters of Stone"" provides a kaleidoscope of human emotions that prove that nothing much except technology has changed since the Ice Age. This reviewer would like Auel to continue this series past ""The Land of the Painted Caves"" to catch up with the couple again when Jonayla has reached a head strong maturity and locks horns with her savvy mom.

When most of your time is spent referencing an appendix at the back of the book to keep the 80+ characters straight in your head, when you close the book thinking it could've been a good 400 pages shorter without editing out any of the genuinely good writing, and when you ultimately walk away thinking to yourself, ""I waited 12 years for THIS?"" you're bound to be disappointed.If well-written epic women's fiction is what interests you most, then do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Before you're brainwashed into thinking THE SHELTERS OF STONE is anything beyond a colordul doorstop, pick up some backlist Jean Auel, the Diana Gabaldon ""Outlander"" books, or anything by Dorothy Dunnett to remind yourself what good writing really is."

It seemed to be a bit choppy, and did not have a definitive ending point, like the others did. There were loose threads and unresolved conflicts that needed answers, obviously leading into the next book, but it seems a cheap ploy to entice readers to continue the series. The other books all ended in ways that made you want to find out more, but were still satisfactory endings, not unresolved situations.I agree with one reviewer who said something about Jondalar's worries about the acceptance of Ayla by his people because of her clan past was unfounded. It seemed not to be that big of a deal to anyone, and wasn't there someone who was supposed to be part Clan who was J's cousin or distant relation or something? (Can't remember the name, it has been awhile since I read it.) He was obviously around before J. left on his long journey, so what was the big deal with Ayla? Did J's people change that much in the 5 years he was gone?Not a bad read, overall, but a bit choppy, probably overly long and drawn out as one reviewer mentioned, and as one of my friends who read it said, it's a bit like prehistoric soap opera."

Please believe everyone who hated this book. What did they, glue all the previous books together? Really, the original content could maybe fill a page. The thing is, aside from the repetition and ridiculous amount of boring dialog, is that there just isn't a story here. I didn't think much of The Plains of Passage, but it least it had the man-hating tyrant and Ayla's rescue of Jondalar. There is nothing exciting in the book. Ayla's enemies sort of fade off into nothing. Like maybe something will happen in the 6th book, but really it won't be worth the paper it's printed on.Buy it (in paperback) and read it because you love Ayla (though she is less humble in this one).

The characters where ill defined, and nothing really much happened. Ayla had her baby! Big whoop. The whole story was basically about how Great and beautiful Ayla was and how handsome Jondalar was. Even the sex scenes were beginning to be all the same. As i mentioned before, Auel did a terrible job on defining her characters. I never once felt like i knew any of the other characters in her book. She didn't tell enough about Brukeval and his problems, and that could have been great.She didn't get enough time to make any friends with the other women either. She made it seem also that Ayla and Jondalar were the perfect man and woman. Ayla had so many great inventions, she could talk to animals, she was the prettiest woman ever! Oh come on! there is only so much one woman could be, and there is no woman that is so beautiful that everyone is just besotted with her. And they made it seem like she had special powers or something. She didn't! Auel also repeated herself in this book. It was like; we know who Ayla is, we don't need her to recite all her titles again. Auel probably spent have the book introducing people. It was absolutely ridicoulous. No one is that gorgeous, no one is that smart, and no one is that lucky. If Jean M. Auel already hadn't been a world famous aurthor, this book would have never hit the shelves. This was definetly not a book to wait six years on. And the people who did waste six years waiting were badly disappointed. From the way this book was written, i'd say Auel spent a hurried month on it, and not the six years traviling to Europe for ""research"" like she said."

This *is* a myth, carefully developed through the series starting with ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" to show how circumstances, time, and distance combine to evolve a mythic figure out of a talented but still very human person.The great, and enduring value of the series is (1) its portrayal of the 35, 000 year-old world when Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal overlapped, the great art of the cave painting and ivory carvings was created, and human ingenuity was starting to make itself felt, and (2) the psychological and cultural interactions of very different mind-sets. Auel condenses the historic record of human invention into one short period for good reason: it helps to convey the difficulties and importance of such creative and flexible approaches in a world where humans were few and weak.To read these works as you would a realistic novel about today's world is to deprive yourself of a rich - and enriching - imaginative experience. If you need realism/naturalism then don't real Auel. Perhaps it is best to classify her work as historic fantasy, or magical realism, or even surrealism."

It seems to me that Jean Auel's books belong to the latter category. Many people are fascinated by the shadowy origins of humanity; Auel has created a richly textured world that presents a plausible picture of those origins. I could hardly put down the earlier books in her series. This one was not quite as much of a page-turner--I read it over several days rather than over a couple of long, intense sessions--but still an absorbing reading experience. Anyone who has followed Ayla this far on her journey will be thirsty for more information about this character and her vividly imagined world. I must say I disagree with another reviewer who said you don't need to read the earlier books because of the flashbacks in this book. The earlier books are a must, and they set up the reader to appreciate the more leisurely pace here. I do think the numerous sex scenes are superfluous, even if they make the picture of ancient life more rounded and complete. I sort of skim or skip over them, because they don't tend to advance the plot or convey any new information about this fascinating world."

I found myself skipping pages to try and get back to the story. But the story was merely a recounting of the previously explained history of Ayla and her skills. The characters are even so similar to previous books characters that the encounters are repetetive. The story that this book tells is almost non- existent. The characters are one dimensional.

When Ayla is introduced to members of Jondalar's family, the lengthy formal introduction is repeated each time she meets a new member, and there are about two hundred members. It is not until about the last three chapters that the book picks up the pace and we begin to get a story line. Maybe this is where Jean began to write. The novel could be considerably condensed by tightening up the prose and eliminating the redundancy. Where was the editor? I felt embarrassed for the author.

I was so excited when the Plains of Passage came out, because I had waited a whole 2 YEARS for it to come out. I started reading the books when I was in junior high school and completely loved them. After I read that book (skipping a lot of the exposition about grass) I remember feeling slightly disappointed, but also thinking that the next book would be really great.There would be a lot of conflict with the Zelandonii considering the reaction Jondalar had to Ayla when he first found out she was raised by the Clan. Also, maybe we would see the first couple of years of life of her child. Maybe the whole Clan/Human conflict would come to a head. Heck, we could even see the return of Derc. I was satisfied that we would get the answers. ..Well, I've been out of high school for 11 years now and finally the next book of the series came out. What. A. Waste. Of. Time.That was the biggest snoozefest I have ever read. I suffer from insomnia, and reading a couple of pages of that book was a sure-fire way for me to catch some zzz's. How did her editor get away with allowing Auel to turn in that garbage? I think Auel has the mistaken dillusion that she's an arthopologist and not a writer. Fine, write an anthropology book.

I enjoyed learning about the theoretical and practical landscape of the time period. I would think about a description of a plant and try to relate it to something I might find in my backyard, or imagine gouging out a slab of wood to make a bowl, or picture the handworking of a hide.Ayla is meant to be ""every woman"", so it's through her we're introduced to insights and inventions and deep observation. I am sorry that Ms. Auel didn't think to hand more of these to other characters, and have the main characters carry them along on their Journey. The Plains of Passage alone would have been much improved, as well as truer to the nature of discovery and invention.I have always been disappointed in Jondalar's dimensionless character. He's not a match for Ayla. As it stands, he's barely there. He was a one-dimensional, homesick worrier on his brother's Journey in The Valley of Horses. A self-pitying mess in The Mammoth Hunters (I actively disliked him and couldn't understand why Ayla would love him at all by the end of that book) and a selfish, annoying worrier in The Plains of Passage. By Shelters of Stone, he lives up to his potential. With nothing left to worry about he's barely present except to agree with everything Ayla says or thinks.There was so much that could have been made of him, especially in this book. Ayla is a stranger and he is home. That theme was reduced to a one-liner in Plains of Passage. Imagine how that might feel; what tensions it SHOULD have created between them. He's welcome, she's excluded. Her fondness for flatheads and the (completely forgotten and unlived upto) hatred of them by the Zelandoni people. Jondalar suffered (interminably) through self-doubt in Mammoth Hunters, yet didn't flinch a moment once he was home. (Where, in the face of his friends and family and witnesses to his childhood indescretions, one could reasonably assume he'd have at least an uncomfortable moment.)Ms. Auel was at great pains to explain the kinship debts and value-exchanges between peoples. Yet, Ayla's foreign origins are glossed over and made trivial except as tension from a single misbegotten Zelandonii drunkard. This alone should have been explored and shown to be deeply difficult. Status was, and is, a hotly contested reality even today. Anyone who's worked in an office and had to settle for the broken stapler and a small cubicle would understand it.How would they handle a woman without status, and no visible wealth, without knowable ties mating into a well-placed family? Why wasn't there more dissention and why wasn't Ayla involved? Why wouldn't Jondalar lose status? In my opinion, he should have. His family should object, not everyone should automatically love her. It would set up some good tension and give Ayla something to overcome.I appreciated a great deal about The Shelters of Stone. As another reviewer pointed out, not all conflict is overt. Ayla makes enemies here. (although I note, she is never 'responsible' for it.) Peer pressure and conflict is introduced. Inability to overcome prejudice and fear. I liked the author's poem-song, very much. I was rather sorry she beat it to death.Ms. Auel explores more deeply the concepts and ideas that might have surrounded death, mating, and conception. I truly liked reading the reactions of some people, like Denanna, (who weren't demonized first, that is) to new ideas. We don't fall in love with new ideas immediately, and human nature hasn't changed that much in 35,000 years! I also liked reading about reasons that a large populace might break itself into smaller settlements, and even hints about the origins of all the settlements throughout the books. I liked the exploration of the Zelandonii homelands, the cave painting descriptions, and the spiritual side of the people brought to life.However, I have to agree that the Ayla character has suffered in the last books, as well. Though independent, smart, and willful she wasn't perfect. She made mistakes. Now she's become cardboard; she never does. If someone dislikes her, there's always an underlying indirect cause. She's always happy, content, and able to relate. She only gets angry on behalf of someone else. She's lost her humanity.I'm with other reviewers on this score. Not everyone has to think she's nice and beautiful. More people should be envious because she's given status they will never see, some should hate her because she brings uncomfortable change, some because she is rather arrogant, or because she has no compunction about challenging their long-held beliefs.Agents of change cause conflict. Where is that in the portrayal of Ayla and the society she's trying join? We've been promised it through thousands of pages. Here we are! And what happens? Nothing.The only conflict we're given is weak; caused by spite and mental problems. That's not only insulting to the established storyline, it's weak storytelling. People aren't that polar. There are any number of shades of feeling. Ms. Auel did the same with Frebec in The Mammoth Hunters and it was every bit as disappointing then. Why couldn't Frebec keep right on hating her? He valued normal and she was anything but.I also have to take exception with a tone change in The Plains of Passage and The Shelters of Stone. In these last two books there are polemic passages. Using supposition and fiction to draw parallels with modern views and comparing those views disfavorably. I'm a feminist, and I abhor vilification and intolerance, but I don't think that living 35,000 years ago made mankind perfect or astoundingly open-minded.Finally, I have to agree with the repetition problem. I firmly believe that the allowance of chunks of repetitious and tedious material is due to the length of time between books; to give us something hefty to read in exchange for the increasingly long waits.If I had the ear of the editors, I'd recommend not doing so. I'll be honest, if I wasn't hooked on Ayla's story, I'd have stopped with Plains of Passage. I just want to find out what the denouement of the story will be at this point. I skip-read a lot of Plains of Passage and The Shelters of Stone. You could be winning whole new fans of the series with a solid, 350-page engaging story rather than frustrating series fans with a 750-page tedious one.Charlene Dewbre"

I waited, along with uncountable numbers of people across the World, for the ""next one"" and hoped the wait would not be much longer.I was not disappointed! ""The Shelters Of Stone"" is, by far, the best of the series. I have watched as Ayla has grown from a frightened lost child into a woman of presence, power and great beauty. Jean Auel describes all of Ayla and Jondalars ""discoveries"" and achievements in such a plausible way. From ""firestones"" to riding horses and taming ""wolf"" to the more in depth ideas on reproduction, Jean explains the events so ""matter of factly"" than one begins to be drawn in and believes that they are reading an account of one who was actually present.The Shelters Of Stone is not a book to be overlooked and believe me when I say you wont be able to put it down!I am left now having to wait for the next and final installment, feeling rather flat after such a high. If the sixth book is only half as good as The Shelters Of Stone, I will not be disappointed."

I have read the reviews of others on this book and in a way I agree with them. This book is repitive but I think that it was necessary to repeat certain facts. I think a lot of her loyal readers forgot that not everyone has read the previous books that began Ayla's journey. I also think that they also forgot that in real life many of your own characteristics and decisions are based on your own past events. Hence, even though it is unhealthy to linger in your past it is important to remember it. I also agree with the fact that in this book at the end I felt left hanging. I did read her comments and she said she was researching for the sixth one so I'm assuming that the reason the ending was left that way was because of the sixth to come. In fact, I think most of the events in this book are to set up the next one. I think that in the final book everything in this book will make sense. Although I think this book played out a little longer than it needed but overall it was a great book. Again her descriptions and details and research continues to amaze me."

I almost started counting how many times someone remarked on what a beautiful couple Ayla and Jondalar make. There is no focus. The point of view is so spread around I started expecting to see points of view from various animals who happened to see the couple. In her earlier books, she had that tight focus of one or two points of view, which made for more tension and drew the reader into the characters. Not in this one.And the constant repititions of observations and various processes for making things made up at least a third of the book.So I ask - where was her editor? Was Ms. Auel padding for word count? She dragged a simple story into a huge, boring tome. As much as I want to see what happens next, if her next book looks as large, I won't waste my money on the hardcover..."

I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, and it really never did. I think there were huge opportunities in the plot line, but it's almost like Auel lost steam because she never pursued them. For instance, the whole book could have circulated around a dramatic meeting or conflict between the Others and the Clan, followed by understanding or resolution. Also, Ayla's character did not ""ring true"" at the end; she was uncharacteristically weak and fearful. Sorry to say, but we should skip this one, and keep the good memories from Clan of the Cave Bear."

I truly enjoyed this one more then the others, as it ties together the past with the present, and overall is an excellent story. (However, I also recommend reading the stories in order, for this draws on the knowledge of the past books in the series.)I really enjoyed the other books in the ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" Series, as I love the main characters, Ayla and Jondalar. In Auel's past books, though I enjoyed the story, I found myself at times felt bogged down by too much description of scenery, and in a few books, too much time spent on intimate moments--over and over. But I kept reading because the main character is captivating and I desired to know what happened.I felt this book was the best yet! The author did not bore me once with too long descriptions and the story was interesting all the way through. There was less repetition and more exciting and wonderful new experiences for the characters. This book was an awesome conclusion to the past books as well as a real new beginning for Ayla. With many challenges to be seen ahead. Her life is never easy, but the way she faces life's challenges in this story are incredible.It was extremely hard to put down. I am really looking forward to another book about these characters, as I feel their lives have really just begun! I am hoping the author will finish another book very quickly, and keep the quality as high as in this one.If you like or can relate to the main character, Ayla, in this series, I am certain you will appreciate her choices and the direction her life is taking. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, so I am not going into details, But this is definitely the best one yet!"

The historical tale continues. The Clan of the Cave Bear etc, etc was enjoyable and Auel&#8217;s ability to create intrigue is undiminished.The cave dwellings in France are detailed so that those who have never been there understand them as if you were a park ranger there. Excellent narrative descriptions of the caves, how they lay, and the directions they face and how they were used. This part is as good as can be written and a first class job was done on this material.I was hoping that Ayla would finally catch a break and be able to enjoy life but petty back scratching women interfered again. The intrigue seems to be less skillfully done than in the other novels but this is an enjoyable read. If this is Auel&#8217;s worst novel it would still be world class by other authors.

I purchased the hard cover and the unabridged tape version. For such a large book, it only covered approximately nine months of their lives. It has too much review, not enough action and way too much description. The review should mainly entice readers who have not read the previous book to do so. I grew tired of all the formal introductions! At least, the problem with the young renegades group of Others men abusing Flat Head women should have been dealt with in this book. The description of the intimate moments ... between Ayla and Jondalar is good but becoming quite predictable. Too many loose ends were left for the next edition. Like finding additional fire stones; Ayla catching fish wither hands; Ayla's acceptance of her calling and induction into the Zelandonii as a healer and ""One who serves the Mother""; Jondalars cousins child birth problems; and how Ayla deals with the few enemies she has made in the 9th Cave. Can Ayla prevent the confrontation between the others and the Flat Heads? How will Ayla deal with her fear of the next great earth quake? I hope the next book will not be so long in coming and will cover several years in the lives of Ayla and Jondalar with a lot more action!"

The book brings you through her pregnancy, their mating, the birth, and also the birth of the new baby for Whinney. Even wolf makes a friend fo his own kind too. Lots of new chartacters to get to know...... makes me look forward to a more careful second reading. And yes there is sharing of Pleasures for Ayla and Jondular, not as many as I thought there would be for such a big book.... but the ones there are excellent and well done ;) Even the characters that do not get along with Ayla and her background get you into the book and wanting more.

I remember really enjoying the first couple books, can't quite remember the next one,however this is the first ones I've bought since those first books.I found The Plains of Passage and The shelters of Stone extremely tedious, with long drawn out geographical descriptions where fewer words would have given the picture just fine. The repetition was tiresome on so many fronts! And I have to say the very long drawn out, descriptive sexual encounters with Jondalar were offensive to say the least! I don't remember that sort of writing in the first books. I never have gotten a kick out of reading about other peoples sexual exploits! It's porn in writing and just wasn't necessary to the overall idea of the story. I found myself skipping over many, many pages throughout the books because of all these reasons.There were so many little mistakes in herbal uses and many of their little inventions that would never have worked the way she described them. And I could not believe the ""soup bowls"" being lifted and carried on horses!! Many far fetched things going on there! Maybe she's not a rider but the way she described the making of the ""water proof bowls"" (with hot soup no less), hefting them up on the horse, with the amount it would have taken to feed the amount of people she described was nothing short of nonsense and very funny!I hope I can get Amazon to refund me for the one I haven't read yet!

(nothing much),"Maybe I had to wait too long for this book. Maybe Auel was pressured into writing it & her heart wasn't in it. Maybe she didn't even write it. Some one of these has to explain the vast difference in enjoyment I experienced between the first 4 books and this one.The more I think about it, the more I wonder how this book even made it out the publisher's door. There was too much repetition & rehash (after 12 years I think readers had too much time to read & re-read the other books and know the past backwards & forwards). Not enough interesting plot development occurred - everything that I expected to have happen in maybe the first 1/4th of the book took the entire 700 pages, and little new or unexpected things happened to spice up the expected events. I suspect 90% of her readers could have fashioned a more exciting plot than this book had, especially after having over a decade to let their imaginations go at it. There were too many characters and sidelines to the story partially developed & then dropped. With all the wait between #4 & #5 I assumed extensive research was involved, but the background development resulting from any research was far inferior to the depth of the 4th book.This book is, at best, an uneventful bridge to book #6, IF Auel's readers are not too annoyed at having rushed out to pay hardback prices for this one to even bother to buy the next one. The things of importance I took away from this book could have been conveyed in a few chapters of the next one. Surely the editors could have seen how inferior this book was to the first four. The publishers can only have been concerned with reaping hardback revenues, not maintaining the author's reputation, to have allowed this book to go out their doors the way it is. I cannot imagine the paperback doing well at all, and if there is to be a 6th book, she has a major redemption task in front of her."

I waited 12 years for it and was not disappointed. While it was NOT one of her best works, Ms. Auel wrote a very entertaining book that answered many questions and tied up a few loose ends left by her previous novels. I understand the need to repeat much of the content from the previous novels - as she has a new audience, some of whom had never read any of the prtevious books - so this one had to be able to stand alone while at the same time be able to entertain those of us who had been left for 12 years without answers to what would happen to Ayla when she came to her new ""family"".On the negative side - the Mother's Song - while the poem loosly fit iambic pentameter in meter and style, it was so poorly composed that I found that it distracted from the actual meaning of the poem itself. Additionally, it could have easily been reduced to 4 stanzas and still have just as meaningful. Additionally, to repeat the poem in its entirity 3 times throughout the novel was extremely irksome. Beyond that she felt the need to explain the meaning of the minute details of the poem to the point that I felt insulted. The poem was in English. I speak and understand English. The relevence of the poem was totally clear to me the first time I read it. Auel did not have to explain it to me.I am most definitely looking forward to the next book in the series in which Ayla ""comes into her own"".

I read ""The Shelters of Stone"" by Jean Auel and loved it. It carried the same flavor and style of the first four books of the series and I am anxiously waiting for the next book.Perhaps what some whiney people didn't figure out was that Ayla and Jondular have finished their year long journey and are now settling in to his home and her new home. They get married and start a family. They deal with ignorance and bigotry. They teach new ideas. They become constructive members of their community. (unlike some of the reviewers)One reviewer claimed to have skipped parts and skimmed other parts ... actually admitting to not having read the entire book ... and still had the nerve to say it was bad. Another reviewer said Auel wasn't good at writing... and another said Auel didn't even write the book... and on and on and on...To the people who spent paragraphs complaining and whining about how bad they thought the book was, listen up...

2915,B000KIT9U4,"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5",,,,315/353,1.0,1020384000,Disappointing doesn't begin to cover it.,"...The Shelters of Stone is not a good book, and it is not a bad book that is fun. It's such an incredible departure from Auel's other books that I question whether she actually wrote it herself. Let me tell you why.In the previous Earth's Children books, she tended to get somewhat flowery and overblown with descriptions of, say, prehistoric tundra landscapes or intricate cultural customs. But the overblown descriptions were at least engaging. She's never been a master of character development -- the characters have always been very one-sided, with the good people being superhumanly good and the bad people being very, very bad -- but at least she made you care about the characters to some extent. And she's never been particularly excellent at writing dialogue, but at least every once in awhile she'd hit upon something poignant, or funny, or interesting.None of these things happen in the Shelters of Stone.The book is a cold, stilted, haphazard, frankly [weak] attempt at continuing the story of Ayla, who loyal readers have known and loved and been following for over 20 years now. The characters are cut from cardboard and stuck in at random intervals where it seems convenient, not to move the story along. Not that there's much of a story -- frankly, about 3/4 of the book is exposition from the previous 4 books. Very little actually happens in Shelters of Stone that you haven't seen happen in the previous books. Ayla and Jondalar meet the Zelandonii, and then every time they meet someone new there's the endless round of introductions, they have to explain Ayla's background, how she got the animals, the spear-throwers, the firestones, etc. etc. ad nauseum.There is thankfully much less explicit sex in this book than in the former books, but Auel more than makes up for the tedious sex scenes with the tedious exposition of covered territory over and over and over. Events that should be touching -- weddings, deaths, births -- are glossed over or ham-handedly dealt with, but then followed by pages and pages of Ayla and Jondalar explaining Ayla's background, which we've known the most intimate details of for four books now. I found myself skipping large portions of chapters just so I could get to the next part that actually had something to do with the story.The dialogue between the characters is so awkward it's painful at times -- it sounds like an 8th-grader's first effort at writing a skit for the school play. The narrative, dialogue and plot careen from point to point, emotion to emotion with seemingly no direction or finesse. Some of the details that have been consistent through the last four books are now different in this book, like the spelling of a major character's name. There were some great opportunities to tell parts of the story we hadn't heard before, about Jondalar's background, but none of those were explored in favor of having Ayla explain for the umpteenth time to some person how she trained Wolf. Also, whoever edited this book needs to be fired, because on top of the numerous problems discussed above, there are comma splices, sentence fragments and other grammatical problems throughout the book. Maybe Ms. Auel was given final edit; if so, that was a really, really bad idea.If Ms. Auel was a new writer and not an established author with several bestsellers backing her up, there's no way this book would have seen the light of day. There are too many literary problems with this novel to even enumerate here. Frankly, the book stunk. It was painful for me to read it, and I was actually sorry afterwards that I had spent money on a hardback.I wanted so much to love this book. I had a bad feeling when I read the first two advance chapters in my bookstore late last year -- the writing just didn't seem up to par with her previous efforts. I honestly believe that Auel only wrote maybe 25 percent of the book, and the editors hastily cobbled together the other 75 percent out of the last four books. I understand there's a sixth book in the works. I'll be waiting for the (used) paperback on that one. It kills me to say this, but if this is the best Auel can do, maybe she should think about retirement."

She was hardly embarrassed at all, which makes you wonder if she's either got her priorities misplaced or if she's a robot. [With the number of things she's invented already, I wouldn't be surprised.]I read in another review that everyone either loves or hates Ayla and Jondalar, and I have to agree. Someone who slightly disapproved of all their showing off would actually be refreshing. Even Zelandoni, who is supposedly a great healer and critical of many people, loves Ayla immediately and tells her she 'belongs in the zelandonia'.Ayla's 'look-out-for-the-little-people attitude is rather annoying as well. Granted, it was nice that she helped Lanoga and Lanidar, but she shouldn't have made such a big deal about it.On the plus side, the book is fairly well written with fewer grammatical errors than there have been. Also, it was interesting to see how Ayla convinced the Zelandonii about 'flatheads'."

The last 40-odd pages sounded more like the Auel we all know and love, but those cannot possibly justify the 700 pages of junk. The only element in that huge section that got me truly excited was Ayla's (inevitable) discovery of the cave that we know today as Lascaux.I was 14 when I finished the series that gave me an inkling about what I wanted to study in college...I'm now 25.

Remember how in the early 90's Tina Turner all of a sudden had this weird brit/european accent? For no apparent reason? Well, the same reader has done books 2-5, and now- in book 5, Ayla has this weird accent. She rolls her r sounds and has this broken language deal going on. Whatever. Like the storylines aren't lame enough, now it sounds awful, too.I'm so tired of their sex life by now, Ayla certainly must be, too. Of course, she is the queen of the instant orgasm, so maybe not.

I thought that Plains of Passage was a little too detailed at time about the flora and funa that the characters were traveling through but overall it was a great story. I'd be happy if Shelters of Stone were in line with that. I just could not get into the story, if in fact there was one. Seriously, the first 300 pages are pretty much nothing but introductions to one-line characters that do nothing for the plot. Pretty much ""this is so and so from this cave"". Then they're never mentioned again. There's a couple of minor conflicts such as when Ayla meets the woman that Jondular was promised to before he left but the conflicts are easily solved. I was also expecting a lot more from the search for Jondular's brother in the spirit world. It was mentioned so many times in the previous novels that I was really looking forward to it. Again, the actual scene fell flat. The characters drink the special tea, go into the spirit world, find the brother, and send him on his way. No muss, no fuss, no bother. The whole part only took a couple of pages. There was more description of the cave that they were in than the event itself. Plus the event is told from Ayla's point of view but only Jondular sees his brother (if he does, they never really discuss it at the time) so she only gets impressions of what's happening. What kind of story-telling device is that? Overall I think that Ms. Auel did a great job researching to give the story local flavor but the plot left me feeling empty."

I have read it and others in the series many times over the years, both in book form and on tape. Though the other 3 books were not as tightly written, they were entertaining and interesting. But not The Shelter of Stones. It is 700+ pages of nothing. It is a rehash of what happened in the past with no depth or creativity. Nothing new happened and even the old stories was told in a very shallow way.All the talk in the earlier books about how Jondalar's kin felt flatheads were so abhorent - the supposed reason for Jondalar's strong reaction in book 2, and embarassment in book 3. They get to his home cave and his kin just say, ""huh - there're human? Gee, that's interesting. Thanks for telling us. We'll have to think about it. ""I suppose the next book could actually have some plot to it. But I'm not going to hold my breath. 700+ pages and we didn't even meet anyone from the Clan.I agree with the readers that disappointment does not even describe my feelings. If you are a fan of the series, you may want to skim through it just for continuity. There is always hope that the last book will be better. But I wouldn't put it high on my list of things to read. Re-reading the other books (which did over the last year) is much more enjoyable."

Hardly what you would call page-turning fiction! We all know that Ms. Auel has done extensive research for these novels, but I really don't want to be reminded of that on every page. Fiction is about plot, character development; not tedious drivel describing the physical landscape.Also, the book is very badly edited. There are so many repetitious parts--how many times does Joharran have to ask Jondalar if he'll teach them how to use and make the spear-throwers!??!

The only negative comment that I have is that there was a lot of repetition about previous books in the series, but I think that can be attributed to the fact that it's been twelve years since the Plains of Passage was published. Ms. Auel, I'm sure, felt that she had to bring everyone up to date since it had been so long. I found the book a wonderful representation of what life would have been like for these people in a normal year(without wars, trials and tribulations). Plus we got a real good picture of the way things were made and just what these people had to do to survive in what could be considered a cruel and hostile environment. I also found that at the end of the book, there is a lot of ground work laid for what is supposed to be the last book in the series. Now Ayla and Jondalar are mated, they have a new daughter and Whinney has a new foal. Bring on the rest of the saga. Thanks Ms. Auel for wonderful escapism."

Her implementation of archeological description is amazing, and the society she has created for these ancient peoples is ingenious. But the fact that I put off college study time for 700+ pages of trite, regurgitated information from the previous four novels is incredibly disappointing.I felt as if I was forcing myself to paste my eyes to the pages and endure the dull plot, which lacked much needed character development and REAL attention grabbing conflict. There were simply too many superfluous characters who had no real impact on the novel at all. I was hanging on every page, not because of what was happening on it, but because of the hope that the next one might hold something interesting.I pray that this is just setting the stage for a phenomenal fifth installment, because this one could have been cut to a quarter of its size and still provide the same monotonous information.

Alya has been accepted into many different cultures; her acceptance follows the same repetitive pattern: People frightened, Alya Help, People Accept, Alya Receive high status.Conflict is missing- no war, insane leaders, travel or new animals. Readers looking for that need to look elsewhere. The book gives a study of the sociology of the time and how the culture operated as a whole. Society's response to the challenge to the belief that the Clan are animals is reminiscent of the challenging of racial stereotypes in modern time.The book is not too focused on details; it is trying to show how the society operates on a daily basis.

Oh, excuse me, I must have fallen asleep over my copy of Shelters of Stone again.I felt almost obligated to read this book in spite of the bad press it's received because I read each of the four previous novels in this series. I didn't like Plains of Passage very much, but had high hopes that Shelters of Stone would recapture something of the feel of the first three books. Alas, Auel has presented us with a tedious doorstop of a book that in the end left me wondering why I bothered to work my way through the whole thing. The plot goes nowhere, there is little character development, and there is so much repetition of material that I found myself skimming pages more and more frequently as I progressed through the book. The whole thing is so badly edited and the conclusion is so abrupt that I was left with the impression that Auel walked away from her computer to get a cup of coffee and while she was gone someone transmitted the unpolished novel to the publisher without her knowledge.And the Mother's Song... Oh, the Mother's Song. What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? It's one of the most outstanding terrible poems I've ever read, rivaling some of the stuff in ""Very Bad Poetry"" (edited by Ross and Kathryn Petras). Never mind the fact that it's repeated several times. One reading was more than enough to convince me that this is one of the worst poems ever written in the English language. It should be awarded prizes based on its sheer awfulness and the way it makes your hair stand on end when you read it.To be fair, I have to say that Shelters of Stone isn't ALL bad. I enjoy books that focus on social history, fiction or otherwise, so the descriptive passages about housing, hunting, and ritual that annoyed so many other reviewers were often interesting to me.In addition, I was delighted to discover that Ayla and/or Jondalar didn't invent the wheel, at least not yet. I've almost been expecting this to happen and was happy to be disappointed in this respect. I suppose there's not much time for inventing in a society where you spend two-thirds of your waking hours naming your ties to everyone you meet.In short, there is very little new information in this book. Auel takes 700+ pages to tell us that Ayla and Jondalar are mated, that their daughter is born, and that Ayla has decided to become One Who Serves. Sorry, Amazon.com, but I can't recommend that people purchase this one. If you're devoted to the series and feel that you must read it, check it out at your friendly neighborhood library and save yourself the purchase price."

I don't really think the problems in this book are that bothersome. The repetition of certain things is kind of annoying, but the repetition has been done throughout the series. I believe that so much of it was allowed in this book because of the likelihood that people may have picked up book 5 without reading the others. I also don't think that Jean Auel tries to portray Ayla as a superwoman. All of Ayla's discoveries are due to her unusual upbringing and the necessity of figuring things out for the sake of her survival. Even her powers in the spirit world may be mostly due to the root experiance that she had. This book may have seemed to move at a slower pace because Ayla and Jondalar have finally reached the Zelandoni and are trying to get settled down.

Yes, the endless passages about flint napping techniques and steppe topography would get tedious, but there was a story around it all that was impelling enough to get through all of that. Ayla is an interesting character in that despite all the tragedy and hardships she goes through, she still manages to be brilliant and perfect. Ok, so that's an unrealistic character trait, but, c'mon, the whole concept of one cro-magnon woman advancing civilization by huge leaps and bounds demands a suspension in belief anyways. Back when the books would come out more frequently, my family and I would often joke about when in the series Ayla would invent the wheel, sailing ships, and agriculture.Which may be part of the reason for my disappointment in this book. Nothing extraordinary happens in over 600 pages of ad nauseum repetition. I unexpectedly found Shelters of Stone in my local library shortly after the death of Kurt Vonnegut Jr. As his quotes were fresh on my mind, I was constantly reminded of his rules of writing that include every sentence must somehow advance the story. I was aghast at how often the same thing was said over and over again in this book. The inane repetition over how the animals were domesticated, or how the fire stones were discovered, or, my God, the third time the Mother's Song was included in the story, I had to start skipping forward just to see if anything happens in this book. Which, aside from some births and deaths, does not.I will read the next book in the series, for the same reasons I read the painful later books in the Dune series - I can't just abandon my earlier investment of time and interest. I can only hope that Shelters of Stone is setting up something wonderful to come."

There are extraneous and redundant sentences thoughout. The first 200 pages or so are both repetitive and badly written. 100 pages could have easily been cut out of the beginning, and it would have been a vastly better book.Nonetheless, the second half of the book partially redeems the very poor beginning. Auel returns to the highly descriptive, beautifully imagined, and evocative prose of her previous books. The repetitions are both fewer and more relevant to the story line. Although not as exciting as her other books, I think that this is in the nature of a book describing Ayla's more domesticated life with Jondalar's people.The ambiguity of the ending retains the suspense of the series going into book 6, but perhaps is a bit too cute by half.

Smith ""charlottesomex""",3/3,3.0,1020729600,Shades of Meaning within Shades of Meaning,"No joy compared to mine when I saw that this book was coming out at the end of April 2002. I've been waiting over 11 years for this book! In preparation, I reread the first four before reading Shelters of Stone. Very bad idea; you'll notice right away that the pace of this book is quite different and there is a superficial depth to the characters. It seemed to read at a lower level and had the feel of a cheap romance novel, in a sense ""dumbed down"" or simplified. If you've read The Clan of the Cave Bear or The Valley of Horses, I hope you'll agree there wasn't a simple, cheap feel to them. I've read many series and this problem appears to happen a lot in the later books. Even the last few chapters of the Plains of Passage seem rushed, especially Ayla's meeting of Dalanar and the Lazandonii.I am disappointed that there wasn't more tension regarding Ayla being raised by the Clan. Jondalar's disgust and revulsion were so complete in the Valley of the Horses that it surprised me that his close kin discussed it so calmly and took the news so well in this book. But, of course, Jondalar has overreacted to a lot of things considering his society and traditions.The storyline regarding Ayla's acceptance by Earth's Children she is surrounded by (whether it be the Mamutoi, Zelandonii or Clan) is basically the same and, I agree, repetitive: Will they accept her? How can she prove she's acceptable? Will they let her stay or even belong? It's always Ayla's sure sense of self, pride, confidence, and her exceptional Gifts that allow her to stay, along with the support of the ones who love her most. Still, this time there was no open hostility or tension and Ayla's acceptance speech was moving.I think that I'm surprised most in Ayla's change of character. It's a subtle irony. She is still strong, capable, intelligent, quick to grasp meanings, a healer, a caretaker, etc, but she seems to exhibit a lot of the qualities she doesn't approve of in others. For example, she's quick to judge people ""bad"" before she knows them, is sometimes way too honest, and gets angry quickly and defensive even quicker. Of course, this is explained through her sense of righteousness and her strong will to help those in need showing through.The search for Thonolon's spirit was quite possibly the most interesting part of the book, especially considering it was a `burden' to Jondalar's spirit since the second book. And I'm glad that Whinney and Ayla finally had their babies.I am looking forward to the next and last book of this series. I had a thought that maybe we're supposed to just meet and greet the new characters to the story in this novel. Get used to their names, their basic qualities and the lay of the land. Plus, tie up the loose ends of the previous books. It appears that the next book will deal more with the spiritual aspects I've enjoyed most in this series. I felt that this was missing in Shelters of Stone. In the previous books, I enjoyed the serendipity that allowed Ayla to discover the things that made her Ice Age life easier, especially since there was no people to tell her something could not be done just because no one had done it before. It's still the best lesson in Jean M. Auel's books."

Along the way she met Jondalar another traveler, and fell in love. Together they have had many adventures in the previous books. In this most recent story, Shelters of Stone, Jondalar takes her to meet his family, the Zelandonii tribe.Jean Auel has again completed a lot of research and written a very thoughtful story of what Cro-Magnon men and women might have been like. Some of the actions of the prehistoric people rang true to me and others seemed a little too sophisticated for that time in our evolution. The pace of this book is a little slower than the previous stories and it seemed to me to be too heavy with descriptive passages. All things considered, it is an interesting story and I applaud the author for her fortitude and diligence in continuing Ayla's saga.Even though I've read the all of the books about Ayla, the first story, The Clan of the Cave Bear continues to be my favorite."

Yes, the book is overly long and repetitious. I'm not sure if Ms. Auel was trying to re-aquaint us or herself with characters who've been missing for far too long. Yet, this series remains on of my favorites. The people, places, and customs remain descriptive and rich in her writing style. As always, there is an element of intrigue boiling just beneath the surface. If indeed Book 6 will be the final installment,then The Shelters of Stone has left many questions that will need to be answered."

I think Auel did an excellent job in developing the storyline - how Aylaintergrating with the Zelandonii and also how the Zelandonii are coming to appreciate Ayla uniquequalities. I so much look forward to the next book and hope it doesn't take too long. I hope Auelwrites several more books to this series - going through Ayla entire lifespan and that of her children's- she give such great insight to what life would be like in the Pleistocene - the attention to detail andaccuracy is the series greatest strenght - perhaps one day the series will be turned into a movie(theather or for tv) with accuracy this time to what Auel has written."

Or was it the long-awaited windfall profits from anticipated sales to fans that motivated them. Of course, the author is primarily responsible for this endlessly pedantic prehistory, which does not even do justice to the cave paintings or their artists. This is a sad way to reintroduce oneself after 12 years, practically a generation having passed in the meanwhile. If another twelve years pass before the final book is available, I doubt if anyone will stick around to read it. I read some fan literature that extrapolated this book's plot and found it much more entertaining and was sad to find that the author-fans stopped in mid story. I think they could have written the whole book and it would have been grand. If these authors are still around, I would encourage them to post the rest of their work. We can all enjoy their creation, in the same way that other fans have rewritten Star Wars Episode One to edit out the drivel Lucas put in. Maybe it will also give Auel some inspiration, which she sorely must need to have taken so long to produce so little. Remember, Jean: Bigger is not necessarily better."

Given the amount of time Auel has been working on this novel, it is almost mind-blowingly bad. I have a hard time, in fact, believing it is even written by the same person as the other books in the series. The writing is poor, there is very little plot, the pace is excruciatingly slow, and above all it is unbearably repetitious. Not only does Auel remind us over and over again of things that have occurred in other books, which alone would probably be forgivable. She also repeats herself within the book over and over, both by literally repeating what the characters are thinking a few paragraphs after first revealing the information (sometime she tells us three or four times as if assuming the reader to be too dense to get it after being hit over the head with it twice) and also by repeating the same plot point endlessly (for example, Ayla and Jondalar reveal the ""firestones"" to each other character in the book individually, so that the reader has to suffer through the identical scene at least five times; same with the ""spear-thrower"" and the animals and the ""pole drag"" etc. etc. etc.).If she couldn't think of a story, she shouldn't have written the book at all, much less subjected us to 800 pages. It is shameful that she will make any money from this piece of dreck, much less the huge amount she will undoubtedly pull in from it."
2950,B000KIT9U4,"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5",,,,2/2,2.0,1025049600,This book was a bit too redundant.,"I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on ""how amazing"" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" and ""Valley of Horses."" (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!"

Did the time lapse bewteen Ms. Auel's last book and this one cause some people to forget that prehistoric times were different from today's world?Yes, personal character introductions are repeated in this book. That's because in the prehistoric world there was no television, radio, or Internet to spread information about unknown individuals. Introductions were also used to show honor and respect. Ms. Auel, as an excellent writer, understands that she needs to realistically represent the patterns people followed when they introduced new people to one another. It's called storytelling.Certainly, the dialogue Ms. Auel writes may not be the snappy, clever or minimalistic Hemingway-type dialogue that is used in modern pop literature, but that's because she is not writing a Tom Wolfe or a James Patterson novel. She is writing to communicate the human-ness and ordinary-ness of prehistoric humans. That is her aim and her casual, refreshing character dialogue is the tool.Ms. Auel includes some flashbacks and rehashes of past events in her book. People are saying they don't like this. Why? The segues fit into the narrative perfectly, and help to add to the drama and power of the story. In real life, people think back over past events all the time. As a writer, Ms. Auel is once again reflecting reality. I suspect the complainers must be people who usually read minimalistic detective dramas or modern realistic fiction where not much internal work happens.People are griping about the fact that Ayla is ""larger-than-life"". Ummmm ... and the point is? Ayla is SUPPOSED to be larger-than-life! Much like a lead character in a graphic or epic novel, she is astounding to both the reader and the characters within the book. She is an archetype. She has always been an archetype. She is not one of those mundane, self-consciously ""normal"" characters people in MFA creative writing classes create. Ayla is the product of a REAL writer who knows how to create unusual characters that people literally love. Do you think people would have named their daughters Ayla had Ayla been one of those modern American Janet Evanovich characters? No, of course not.In addition, Ayla is one of those history-changing people that pop into existence now and then. People are whining because Ayla makes all sorts of new discoveries, like how to use rocks to make sparks, where babies come from, how to make a pole drag, etc. Well, people like that DO and HAVE existed. Look at Leonardo da Vinchi and Einstein for examples.I also don't understand why people are objecting to how Ms. Auel makes Ayla very beautiful and grants her a very charismatic personality in the book. Again, extremely beautiful women have existed in the past: ever heard the phrase, ""The face that launched a thousand ships""? Charismatic women have existed as well: Joan of Arc, for one. And sometimes women have existed who were both supernaturally beautiful AND charismatic: consider Cleopatra as an example.Finally, people are saying they are unhappy with Ms. Auel's long descriptions in the book. The long descriptions are there because it is an EPIC tale and an EPIC book. Tolkien did the same thing and no one complains about him. Besides, Ms. Auel wants to impart some knowledge of prehistoric times to the reader and enhance the artistic level of the narrative in doing so. As Ms. Auel has said; ""The magic is in the details.""This book is a worthy accomplishment of a top-notch writer and should be bought, savored, and reread. If you are brave enough to have an open mind, buy this book. If you just follow the pack and base your book purchases on what the masses are saying, well then, you will only be cheating yourself when you miss out on this wonderful, fascinating work by one of the world's greatest living authors."

Wherefore art thou Ayla...?In the first book we rooted for her. The young girl, without a family, who thinks differently, rebels, but most of all survives. We believed in her world...it was harsh and demanding. It was easy to suspend your disbelief. We believed in her. In the second book, still surviving, she found love and the ugly duckling turned into a swan. We were pleased to see that. After all she's been through, the girl deserved some happiness. In the third book, we wanted her accepted by her own (at least in between all the sex sessions). By the fourth book, Ayla was starting to get predictable and annoying. And then we waited.Time passed, some of us finished high school, college, got a job, got married...from time to time hoping that we'll get to visit Ayla's world again. And finally there she was,perfect to the point of nusea, singing the longest and most annoying song. Every time Ayla looked at something, she turned into a heroine like no other. Her society, more politically correct than ours, never suffers. None of the caves fight with each other, in fact I don't think these people knew what war was. The herbal remedies that are more efficient than anything you can find in 21st century. And boy, does the traveler get treated better among the Zelandoni than today. (No one will ever steal from you in Ayla's world that's for sure.)Honestly, sometimes I felt like I was watching a child's play made up with Barbie dolls: ""Let's play house...this will be the home...people will eat here...oh, I know, let's have a little cup there so if someone wants a drink, they can use it!"" The dialogue certainly didn't help.Having said all that...and more, which was mentioned by other readers already (unlike the book, I will not be repetitious) I am waiting for the sixth part. Like a fool, I hope Ayla will become human again. And now, I think I will have a cup of tea, look to the right and notice cure for cancer sitting right in front of me."

I must part company with this one, though. It commits the unpardonable sin for literature: It bores. Despite several provocative sub-plots and themes (racial prejudice, child-bearing questions, gender equality, religion) not one is developed fully. The book seems written in starts and fits; a promising idea is introduced and expounded, when suddenly we leave the narrative for yet another walk through the countryside with animals or observers as Ayla imparts her womanly wisdom of the ages.The meandering New Age chanting is repetitive at best and infuriating at worst. Considering what we now know about the development of religious ceremony (including chorus)in ancient Greece, it is highly improbable that this level of thought (which sounds suspiciously modern) was reached. For one thing, abstraction in language is a rather recent development. Although primitive man invoked ceremony when burying the dead, it is doubtful that a deep level of theological sophistication was reached.The relationship between the two main characters does not grow nor really change. He is still in awe of Ayla and her powers and she is still panting for his manly, uh, accessories. Mom, dad and all the relatives added little to the story. In fact, the half-breeds, which held the most promise, simply faded away. I suppose the chief complaint is that I was expecting something bold or new or different on the order of Clan of the Cave Bears. Despite intense research and quirky, original ideas on how primitive folks lived, the story reminds me of that saying: Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
2954,B000KIT9U4,"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5",,,,8/8,2.0,1020902400,"Captive audience, but major letdown...","I've been waiting for the release of this book for almost 10 years. I started the series in high school, and books 1-3 quickly became some of my favorite books. The 4th book started to get repetitive and dragged a lot, and I was hoping that wouldn't be the case with this one. Unfortunately, that is the case. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Mammoth Hunters, but what I got was a stream of forgettable characters that were never very well-developed. Too many characters were introduced, for no good reason. I kept mixing up the two women whose names started with ""P"", and the two men whose names started with ""B"". And too many different caves to keep track of.It's the same old story...Ayla is perfect. People don't trust or like her at first, she must prove herself by showing them her inventions and skills, then they love her and practically make a goddess out of her. Puhlease!!! I used to like Ayla, I really did, but I've lost interest in her because she is no longer realistic at all. I mean, does she have any faults? The only one I can think of is her inability to sing (which I find completely ridiculous, since she is able to mimic every animal known to man - why can't she mimic a good singing voice too?). Ayla is just TOO perfect. She is no longer human but a mockery, sort of like a child's superhero. She needs to wind up on the losing side sometimes, needs to reveal SOME human foible! The chick is starting to really annoy me. I've actually started rooting for her antagonists. The story would be richer and more intersting if just for once, Ayla didn't become allied with the most powerful people in the tribe, the most skilled, the ones with the highest status. Why can't Wolf really kill someone? (then she'd have to suffer through guilt and be truly ostracized) Why can't she get truly ANGRY once in a while? Like a real person?I was hoping this novel would answer a lot of lingering questions put forth in the first 4 books. I was sadly disappointed. There didn't seem to be much of a plot, other than Ayla meeting new people, the endless recitations of relationships and titles, Ayla showing everyone her inventions, etc. Of course Ayla is going to be challenged, and of course she is going to overcome it fabulously. One thing I was surprised at, was the lack of Jondalar's character in much of the story. His relationship with Ayla seemed to lose its steam.I admit that I used to like Auel's descriptions of Pleistocene Europe, but endless descriptions of this valley, that stream and this rock outcrop got very tedious. I skipped over many paragraphs, and at time many pages, just to get to some action. I think Auel did a disservice to her longtime fans by bogging them down with too much description of the landscape, and too much repetition of Ayla's exploits, of which we are already familiar! (I mean, come on! Hardly anyone is going to pick up this book, 5th in a series, without having read the other books!).I think this series has definitely run out of steam. I must admit that I'm only halfway done with the book, but it's all I can do to finish it, and this is coming from a person who has read and reread the first 3 books at least 4 times each!! It is a CHORE to finish this book. I keep hoping something interesting will happen, some questions about Ayla will be answered, but I am let down. The points in the story that are supposed to be important leave me feeling really ho-hum. Of course I'll finish it, just because I'm such a long-time fan of the series, but I almost wish that Ayla and Jondalar would've settled down with the Sharamudoi and the series ended there. I can't imagine how the last book will be any better than this one. This book put me to sleep. It's sad. It truly seems that Ms. Auel's heart was not in this book."

I was so grateful to have the next book in the series that none of this mattered. My biggest disappointment was that it seemed to end too soon - kind of wrapped up an awful lot of plot in a very small percentage of the book. However, I would probably have been disappointed if the book had been twice as long - I just didn't want it to end.I have read it three times, bought two CD copies and one audiotape copy for myself, a copy for my sister, and two of my daughters. I guess you would have to say that I am more than fond of the characters. I think Auel has set herself quite a task for the next book because she has set up so many scenarios which will need resolution. I hope that she had the next book planned when she released this one - otherwise I'm not sure I'll live long enough to read it.My thanks to Auel for many, many hours of entertainment, and for fostering an interest in the world of the Neanderthals and Cromagnons.

Everyone loves Ayla; Ayla and Jondalar tie the knot; Ayla gives birth to the hellspawn and while her name is incredibly stupid, it still ends up sounding better than Twilight's Renesmee.I don't know whether I should be upset that I spent all this time listening to the book equivalent of a 90's clip show or I should be laughing at the ridiculous joke of this being published. Or cry thinking about how many trees this destroyed on its route to the bookstore. Or rage about the number of books that were rejected to make room on the bookseller list for THIS.I've done my raging about this series; it's been a ridiculous, over the top Mary Sue-ridden barely concealed fanfiction-y ride. But I almost want to go back to all the previous books and bump up the ratings by a star or two (YES, a star or TWO). With ALL the complaints I've had for the last three books (and if you've read my reviews, you know THAT is a laundry list), those books look like literary GOLD next to this piece of Mammoth defecation.Gone are any attempts at making Ayla a realistic character. Gone are any attempts to take this story to the next level, to have ANYTHING to do with ANYTHING that has come before. Gone are any attempts to treat the reader with intelligence.Ayla is the biggest Mary Sue I've ever read. She is such a flagrant Mary Sue, I had to check to make sure that this wasn't fanfiction; I wouldn't be surprised to see this characterization from a thirteen year old girl on the internet, but from a 60+ woman? You coulda fooled me! Ayla is the sexiest, most attractive, most intelligent, most competent woman that the world has ever seen. She could heal cancer with willow bark tea; she can wear boy's underwear and a top with her boobs hanging out and no one will mutter a peep about her indiscretion--in fact, women will imitate her and every man will get a huge boner for her (and yes, this does happen). Everyone gasps in admiration about her ability to tame animal, everything she says is as if from the Mother's lips. She rushes into the town drunk's home to rescue his starving family, and the crowds cheer. She heals a stupid boy that was hunting rhino, and the audience roars. Ayla could blaspheme the Mother, destroy their religion, and burn the entire shelter to the ground, and STILL the ENTIRE Zelandani race would cheer her on.In fact, I took the Mary Sue test for Ayla. Wanna know what she got? 161. Know what that corresponds to? """"50+ Kill it dead.""Jondalar is still a whining baby. All he wants is for Ayla to remain flat on her back so he could pound into her all day with his massive dong. The only reason he turns down performing First Rites is because his massive dong would scare off the young virgins and NO ONE could take him all. WOW HOW FRAKKIN' ROMANTIC!! I wished so many times that he would fall off a cliff or chop off his hand or break his dong on Ayla's ""petals of perfection"".It is an insult to call the other characters ""characters"". The only ones who act even REMOTELY human are Marona, who is understandably upset because her fiance, Jondalar, ran off and she was left with NO COMPENSATION (and Jondalar is back, thrusting Ayla, the Woman Who Can Do No Wrong in her face), Brukaval, who wants Ayla to mind her own business for once, and the dude that Jondalar punched in the face and TOTALLY ruined his livelihood. Marthona, Jondalar's mother, accepts Ayla with barely a second thought. Same with Joharran, the leader of the 9th clan. Zelandani aka Zolena, the Dani woman that Jondalar loved SO MUCH and couldn't be with, is morbidly obese, conveniently ""unattractive"" to the vapid Jondalar. Everyone else that would have made a shred of conflict is painted so painfully villainous, it would have been more subtle to have them dress in black, twirl their mustaches, and cackle maniacally.And all the stupid poor widdle kids that Ayla has to rescue! GAH! For once, I would like this woman to do something selfish, for her own personal gain, instead of rushing over to the town drunk (who hates her) to rescue his POOR FAMILY, to shame all the rest of the clan women into giving the baby their birth milk because, ""Even the Clan would do that, and you think they are animals!"" In fact, I think Auel ""wrote"" half the book by just tossing in a new character that Ayla has to fix whenever she got tired of pasting in stories from previous books.There is so much repetition in this book, it's borderline plagiarism. We are reminded TWENTY-TWO TIMES that Ayla has an unusual, exotic accent. I am not stupid; I think I got it after the first time!! (I was going to post each one of the 22 quotes where it is mentioned, but I didn't want to get repetitive!) Other conversations that Auel has had in the past--every story from the last four books, where babies come from, how Iza told Ayla to wash up after having sex, how many times Ayla goes to""pass water"" (and how much more often she is going to ""pass water"" now that she is pregnant)--is repeated over and over and over and over again. And then the introductions! GAH! Here is just ONE introduction:""I am Folara of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, blessed of Dani, daughter of Marthona, former leader of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, daughter of the hearth of Willamar, master trader of the Zelandani, sister of Joharran, leader of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, sister of Jondalar of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, master flintknapper and returned traveler who is soon to be mated to Ayla of the 9th cave of the Zelandani. She has a bunch of names and ties of her own, but the one I like best is ""friend of horses and Wolf"".""Imagine this for nearly EVERY ""character"" and multiply that by infinity. That is how many times I had to read this. If I didn't know better, I would have thought that twenty different writers wrote this book, threw together their portions in one big pot and sent it directly to publish.And if you thought the previous books were in any way misogynist, you haven't even SEEN this book. Here are some WONDERFUL quotes from this supposedly equal-rights culture:""She had become Ayla of the Zelandani and Jondalar's mate, and that came first.""""Though a stigma of shame was placed on those who did not wait until they had their First Rites, some girls inevitably did succumb to the persistent blandishments. But no matter how relentless the pressure, by yielding to it, the girls became ultimately less desirable as mates because it indicated a lack of sufficient self-control.""""It is true that your mate will not be as tempted to look with pleasure upon other women if you satisfy his desires.""""Maybe [Jondalar] should have asked [Ayla] before he started all this [so Ayla could become Zelandani]""Wow, HOW FAIR! Girls who have sex before First Rites are looked down upon because they can't wait. But boys? NOTHING. If your man leaves, it is YOUR FAULT because you didn't have sex enough with him. Sounds great, doesn't it?Oddly enough, there are only 3 sex scenes in this book. Not surprisingly, they are pretty much the EXACT SAME sex scene we've read since ""Valley of the Horses"":Jondalar goes for Ayla's boobs.Jondalar moves to Ayla's ""petals"".Ayla moans and can't believe how ""ready she is"".Jondalar wants to take her ""right now"" and can barely hold back.Insert Tab J into Slot A. Fireworks, explosions, flowers fall from the sky and angels sing.And then we have the Mother's Song. I have a great aunt that used to write poetry about what happened to the family in the past year (and force rhyme to death out of it) and put it into her Christmas cards. The poetry would be something like this:And Johnny did run to the store one dayTo say hello to his Aunt MayAnd what do you think should happen there?He found a cute, adorable, cuddly bear!THAT is better poetry that this horrible mess. And the absolute LAST THING I wanted was Ayla commenting on how moving and wonderful this poem was.I am SHOCKED that this book took 12 years to write. I would have given it 12 days: that would be PLENTY to pick through the last four books, copy all the stories from there and paste them into this waste of paper, sprinkling a bunch of senseless research, bad sex, and Ayla Sue prancing around, telling someone off for their ""bad behavior"" or saving the day for some poor, precious, downtrodded person.I just have one question: HOW THE FRAK DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?!?!!!?!? This is, without a doubt, the WORST book of the series so far. It is pointless, it totally negates all the tension of that the last four books have been building up to, wondering and worrying if Ayla would be accepted into the Zelandani. I've read fan fiction better written than this.So my advice? AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"

Auel gives us the setup for some intersting things to happen (Marona, Laramar, Brukevel, Madroman, Ayla's training to become Zelandonni, trading and/or conflict with the Clan, etc.), but she never delivers the action, only hints at possibilities that we can only hope will be revealed in the 6th book. All I can say is that there better be a 7th book or the 6th book better be really long, because I don't see how she can cover and conclude everything in any other way. I love Auel, and I loved seeing my old friends again, I just miss that Earth's Children's feeling..."

Ayla has become such a goody-goody with none of her previous fiery personality and Jondalar has none of the character he had in the previous books.

Almost half of it is either a rehashing of what took place in earlier books or the same thing happening over and over again in this book. The plot also does not advance much. She spends many pages describing the imaginary scenery, which seems beautiful but not necessary to the story. She does introduce many characters, but the character development is limited to only a select few. Indeed, a character introduced early on who appears to be a main protagonist, is then summarily dropped except for a couple of casual mentions 400 pages later. Finally, large spans of time are allowed to proceed without any text. All of a sudden a whole season goes by with only 50 or so pages of text. The book did progress the story, but the same amount of progression could have been done in 100 pages. It feels as if this book was just filler till the next one."

After waiting 13 long years for the sequel to Plains of Passage, (which, in my opinion, started Auel's lack of wonderful story telling that the three previous books had had)you can imagine my disappointment when yet again we have an incredibly long boring stale story. Most people who would read Shelters of Stone are familiar with the Earth's Children series; therefore, we do not need an entire book of rehashing the past 4 books. There were barely any new story lines and each page was racked with long drawn out personal histories of people that didn't really matter to the story as a whole. Auel could have gone soooo many places with this new book, when instead it's just another narrative on how to skin a deer. Believe me, it pains me to not like this book because I really wanted to...but Auel made it so hard to really get into and enjoy. I can only hope that the next installment of the series goes back to the beauty of the first 3 books.

I found it confusing, repetitous, wordy, and lacking in follow-through. .The numbering of all of the Zelandoni caves, as well as each having a descriptive name , often confused me. Especially when Jean Auel would use the different names/numbers interchangably throughout. As with her previous books, we again find out how spear throwers came about, how to use firestones, the lay of the land, (which is good if you are an archeologist studying the Danube river region and parts of France), and what it was like for man and beast to live in that era. I admit I skimmed and skipped many paragraphs when it became nothing but textbook material. Ayla did seem to have ""grown up"" in this book, having gained a backbone and level of maturity. But the hype of the Zelandoni's negative attitude of the Clan was a washout. If you are wanting to read it, rent it at your local library first, before purchasing it. I'm now glad I didn't buy it."

I felt like I had to read about it all over again: the introduction of the spear thrower, the contraception tea, the flint stone for making fire, the horses, and the wolf. And of course how PERFECT Ayla is, I swear that girl never makes a mistake, whereas Jondalar is a little more believable. There was a lot less sex in this book, than in Plains of Passage, probably because the two main characters weren't alone as much this time around. Jean Auel has definately lost her edge a bit since The Clan of the Cave Bear. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of two, was because of how much I like this book series as a whole."

While Auel's bad is definitely better than some author's good, it may prove to be a disappointment to some readers, and I definitely recommend that anyone whose never read the series before start at the beginning with Clan of the Cave Bear. This book does not suit well as a stand-alone.For those not familiar with the series (and a possible spoiler) Ayla was a little girl when she was adopted into a clan of Neanderthals. She was raised by them but eventually had to leave, and in doing so leave her son behind, to try to find others like herself. She didn't find them right away and instead spent time in a valley where she makes unlikely friends with a horse and lion. Eventually though, a handsome ""other"" named Jondalar ends up in her valley and they fall in love. The travel for awhile and stay with a tribe of people called the Mamutoi for a bit until finally making a perilous journey far to the west where Jondalar's people dwell.This book starts when they first reach the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, Jondalar's home. People are excited and anxious for awhile as Jondalar and Ayla have brought their two horses and wolf pup with them, which before now, had never been heard of. They meet several people and have to convince them of Ayla's worthiness to join the Zelandoni. Some people are taking far too much of an interest in her however, and the First of the Zelandoni (spiritual leaders, healers, etc.) wants her to become a Zelandoni herself as she is believed to be too dangerous left to her own devices. But all Ayla wants is to have her matrimonial with Jondalar and raise the baby that she is currently pregnant with.The characters are not as well written in this book. Ayla and Jondalar are once again too perfect. All of Jondalar's immediate family is too perfect as well and it would have been nice to even see some average people that were close to him instead of exceptional ones. It would have made the story much more believable. Those that aren't the nicest of people are usually far away from his family. The Zelandoni kind of creep me out too and I'm sure Auel wanted to make them sound important, but to me they just sound like a cult wanting to bring people ""into the fold.""The writing is very descriptive but it doesn't work well for Auel in this novel. It gets boring at parts and often times, I really didn't care what a certain cave that is only mentioned once in the entire novel looked like up and down and inside and out. I was also disappointed with how she chose to incorporate her research. There were new things she must have learned and wanted to add but made it seem awkward if you were familiar with the other books. For example, she goes to great lengths to describe an Elan (spirit of a person) and uses it quite heavily in this book, however, Jondalar never mentions it in any of the other books. Auel explains this by having Jondalar trying to keep it simple for Ayla, but one would think that something so important to his culture would be the first thing he share with her. I can understand wanting to include research, but sometimes it just hurts the book instead. Another thing people should note about the writing of this book is that it has a lot of sex scenes that are very descriptive.I like the series and as said before Auel's bad is still pretty good. I look forward to reading the finale and seeing what resolutions are made for Jondalar and Ayla's adventures.Book 1: The Clan of the Cave BearBook 2: The Valley of HorsesBook 3: The Mammoth HuntersBook 4: The Plains of PassageThe Shelters of StoneCopyright 2002749 pages + Character ListingReview by M.

I have read all of the Earth Series Books, except the last, four times through, and love it. I love the way Jean starts the book with the next obvious breath from the last exhaliation of the previous book. Always with the curious and fearful people wondering just who Alya and Jondalar are. I love the way she jumps right in with the action of the story of the main characters greeting then finding something to do. Had it been my journey, I think that I would have wanted to sleep for a week.The characters blended very well, and I see that she has left herself open for a sixth in the series. I just hope we do not have to wait fifteen years. I was totally blown away as Jean Auel explained the number of trips to and from Europe. My feelings of gratitude have grown in such leaps and bounds, because I know, now, how much work goes into these kinds of series. Jean Auel, if you get to read this, please know my great thanks for the book you just finished, and for them all, as I have been so antsy to read it. Like a child waiting for a holiday, for when I read your books, I see myself in the situations you write of. Truly and totally enjoy, do I, your ability to tell such wonderful stories. I thank you for doing it to entertain us readers that know the good stuff and don't waste time on those that are not. I also love the series by Kathleen Gear and her husband, Michael. Sue Harrison is not to be left out, nor in a different setting, I love Tony Hillerman for his modern day mysteries of the Four Corners area of the US.I apologize for and am sorry that I was so anxious that I became greedy with your time. I just felt 'the book wasn't here fast enough.' But when I finally saw that your new book was out, my heart was singing a new song. I ordered my book from my book club, and within 5 days, I had finished another great book of the life and love of Alya of the Mind of Jean Auel. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being this kind of human, to share the results of your very talented mind and thought processes with us. You truly do make your fans wait with such anticipation of excitment, like waiting for a great and precious present.I am glad Wolf was not killed. Nearly thought he might be when I got to that part, but breathed easier at the next chapter.I find myself from a range of feelings all throughout this book - tears of joy, guard-like watchfulness of the ones who would be envious of Alya and Johdalar, barely controlling the sexual arousal that come with the couplings of Alya and Johdalar. I have no husband and, whew, they really love each other. Glad you wrote them this way. It seems like we are peeking through a key hole to spy on them when these parts are read. Whew! Anyway, takes me back to when I had a love to share pleasures with.Thanks again. Hope to live long enough to read your next one, when Alya joins the Zelondia for she is truly a great and good character, she deserves to honor the mother earth.Well, I have gone on, haven't I.Sincerely and with great gratitude, I sign,Penny Haulman"

AUEL ""Earth's Children"" I beleve is one of the most inspiring series of books out there. Yes it a series based in prehistoric ice age and the accention of man as the dominant species, but many over look that it is an moving love story. Its sory line has significance even to this day. Ayla cromagnon woman raised by neaderthals has to cope with being a minority in a male dominant society. It deals with racial inequalities, mix marriages ,standing up for what you believe in, and the power of women. It teaches that flexability,family, and tolerence is what make us human. It teaches perserverence, fortitude, and resilience when faced with survival. If your life depended on grouping with others for survival, it would you give a life altering experience that few have known. I believe todays society would benifit from this. Often I have wondered if I lived in prehistoric times would I have the courage of AYLA and all she faced. These books offer that experience to readers and also teaches early birth of moral values. The love between AYLA and JONDALAR is very real, and they faced many things that young and old alike face today.It also ponders the question when face with over welming odds that humans create, adapt, perserveer. I have recommend this series to all that can read. The sex scenes are just that, sex in the raw form, not shameful, or imoral just a very natural wonderful showing of love. Many only know the movie with Darrl Hanna as AYLA in clan of the cave bear, which I beleve she did a wonderful job, but that only scatches the surface of the wonder of ALYA full story. These books are self contained so each are a story in of them selves. Very easy reading and imformative. One you can not put down and will have you waiting for more."

It feels like Auel's heart was not in this one, and frankly I could not even finish it, abandoning it half-way through.The interest in a book about ice-age people would be in the author's insight into a different way of life, different social patterns, even different thought patterns. Enlivened by Auel's curiosity and research, earlier episodes were both believable and interesting, most especially the first ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" a gripping, realistic portrait of how the world may have appeared to Neanderthal man.Granted that Ayla is now with people who are recognizably human, nonetheless, shouldn't there social and thought patterns by different from ours. Is it inevitable that Cro-Magnon man arrayed himself into little family units, with parents and children living together like families in suburban houses. Is it believable that ice-age humans had liberal sensibilities like ours. And even if so, is this an interesting book?There are too many anomalies here. The people depicted clearly had no sense of agriculture, no crops, no livestock. They lived off of what food they could kill or gather each day. Surely they were frequenly near starvation, and must have had to move about frequently. While we would like to believe that our ancestors lived harmonious social lives, it is too much for me to believe that this was not a world of great and irrational violence. Auel's people never seem to suffer from disease, just the occasional accident. They seem to value cleanliness in exactly the same way we do, and this also seems quite far-fetched. If nothing else, wouldn't they have continual toothaches, not to mention numerous other diseases related to a seasonally deprived diet. Surely communities in this age were always on the brink of extinction, but you get no sense of that in this book.What is nice is Auel's depiction of their appreciation of handicraft and fine art.She peppers the book with detailed, but largely irrelevant sex scenes. And there are numerous very silly episodes."

I am a huge history buff, facinated with pre-historic times and anthropology, and this entire serious had taught me so much. Ayla is such a beautiful character, and Jondalar is a man that the reader falls in love with right along with Ayla. The book inspires so much in the imagination, thinking about what life looked like back then, the people, the landscape, the wildlife. Its facinating, the research that must have gone into a project like this series. I'm not one for really giving a review on english standards, I just know that I loved this book for the creativeness of the characters, the imagination it inspires, and the research of history that went into the book(s).

Flanery,6/6,3.0,1107302400,Could have been better,"As soon as I heard this book was coming out, I placed the date on my calendar so that I could buy it immediately upon release. I had read the other four books, and was hooked after reading Clan of the Cave Bears. By far, the first book was the best, and I really was rooting for the character, Ayla. I read the other three books, and my interest waned a bit with each, but in general I was still enamored with the series. However, Shelters of Stone was not the book I was expecting. I must agree with many of the other reviewers who were tired of the repetition that Auel used, and I found myself skipping over large repetitive sections of the book. In addition, as usual from books 2-4, I continued skipping over the romance novel love scenes of Ayla and Jondalar. Enough about his large ""manhood."" I feel that these romance novel interludes were added to books 2-5 to attract a larger reading audience, which is a real shame because the first book, Clan of the Cave Bear, did not have these scenes and is by far the best. However, I digress. The main thing I did not like about Shelters of Stone was that throughout the series we have followed almost every single day of Ayla's life, starting at age 5, or so it seems. However, when it comes to her pregnancy, which was built up to the be the climax of the storyline about her use of contraception/Jondalar's desire to have a child of his hearth, Ms. Auel almost skips it entirely. Instead, it was like a fast forwarded version of a pregnancy. I must say though, that although I was disappointed by the book, it was readable and I have read it once again since my initial read. Also, I will tune in for the sixth installment, just to see how it ends. I guess after you invest that much time into something, reading 5 books, you just need to know the ending, even if it appears it may be anticlimatic. My suggestion is to read this book if you have read the other four, and really need to know what happens to the characters. However, if you are not emotionally invested in the characters it will probably not be worth your time."

Williams,7/7,1.0,1265673600,In desperate need of an editor,"There were originally supposed to be five books in the series; this is maybe half a book's worth of content expanded and fluffed out to serve as setup for the final book in the series. I will not be reading the final book because I'm too disappointed in this one.Ms. Auel is a fine writer and she does good research. Yet this book lacks the character development and structure that characterized her earlier work. It comes across as having been written on an ad hoc basis here and there. Unlike a Tolkien tale that ""grew in the telling"", this just kind of rambles. Auel's using a loose episodic structure instead of the plot-driven and character-driven style from ""Clan of the Cave Bear"". It isn't working. The repetition is getting old. A good editor would not have allowed this much repetition, particularly of that mediocre poem. Editing would have condensed the ""story"" and plot into about a hundred, maybe a hundred and fifty pages of potentially good reading. But that wouldn't have allowed for a sixth book.The character development in this book is particularly sloppy. Auel was starting to lose it as early as ""The Plains of Passage"" because of the repetitive nature of what had to happen: Ayla and Jondalar meet people, people meet horses and Wolf, people freak out, etc., etc. By now she's in the very familiar series-writer problem: how does she bring a new reader into the story without reiterating what people who have been following the series already know? She's accordingly cut corners in the development not only of her main characters, but in the development of new characters. Even the love scenes are repetitive and lack variety. Large amounts of terrain and anthropological information is repeated from previous books.Earlier in the series, even the antagonists were not presented in a uniformly negative way. Broud, Frebec, Attaroa, and other antagonists were presented as products of their environments. None were completely evil. Each had some redeeming qualities. Each one had a plausible reason for hating Ayla, and the resolution wasn't always complete. Ayla definitely didn't always win and the conclusion was not always foregone. But after ""The Mammoth Hunters"" where Ayla did successfully bring a community around to support her, detractors and all, every other community she and Jondalar encountered has followed more or less the same shock/revulsion/acceptance pattern. What started in ""Plains"" has continued in ""Shelters"". The characters have become very black and white in a way that worked in ""Plains"" because Ayla and Jondalar were just passing through. It doesn't work in the community they've made their home. These newer characters either adore and nearly worship Ayla, or they are severely defective and their objections to her are based solely on their own inadequacy and bigotry. When Frebec and Broud disliked Ayla, their dislike had a reasonable basis in fact. In ""Shelters"", the only people who dislike Ayla are those who are completely immature or who are threatened by her superiority.Meanwhile, Ayla and Jondalar have stopped making mistakes and being human. In ""Clan"", Ayla was impulsive and sometimes immature. As recently as ""Mammoth"" she made a serious error in judgement and got engaged to the wrong guy. But somewhere during ""Plains"", she gradually morphed into this omniscient, infallible person. There's nowhere to take this character. She's been overbuilt. The only way she comes into conflict with other characters or with societal rules is if those characters and rules themselves are wrong. But, unlike in ""Clan"", where the rules triumphed over Ayla, in ""Shelters"" when the rules are wrong, it's the rules and the society themselves that have to change instead of Ayla. Suspension of disbelief aside, it's impossible to keep this Mary Jane state of affairs and still build plot tension.Now, if Ayla made a medical mistake and someone got badly hurt as a result, or if she had a fight with Jondalar, or lost her temper, or went on an ego trip and told off Zolena or somebody powerful for no good reason, it might be different. Similarly, if Wolf developed rabies, if one of the horses broke a leg, or if Baby showed up and started eating people, that would provoke some legitimate conflict. As it is, Ayla's become a force of nature. Forces of nature are... not... interesting... to read about.Jondalar's character has mostly flattened out. His development was best in ""The Valley of Horses"". As recently as ""Mammoth"" he was inventing stuff and generally acting like an individual and not just a foil for Ayla. He started his decline in ""Plains"" and is now simply an object to be fought over by women.Essentially, this is half a book, and less than half a character if you add up everybody."

The Valley of Horses continued with Ayla's struggle to survive, ending with finally meeting one of the Others. The Mammoth Hunters starts turning into prehistoric soap opera, introducing another man to compete for Ayla's affection, while Jondular mopes around. The slide started there. The Plains of Passage was nothing more than traveling and sex scenes. Now we have the Shelters of Stone. I guess I thought that after the Plains, Auel took 12 years to bring back some drama and plot, and improve the series. Turns out she must have had writer's block, and the publisher obviously forced her to get something, anything, worked into a manuscript. The editor did a terrible job. This book should have been 400 pages instead of 750. I had anticipated this book, but now I think it's only worth reading out of curiosity and as a bridge to the next and final story, which I will probably be too old and decrepit to read."

Sadly, the ""voice"" slips towards the end of the book, and the last portion is just a setup for the next book.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't read the rest of the series, but you won't need to re-read the whole story before tackling this enormous book (maybe just look over the last chapter of Plains to remember where it ended). Auel peppers the novel with reminders of what went on in the previous books (helpful, but a little annoying if you've just read the others in a marathon session, which I had...), and (thank goodness) she included a list of names at the end - I think it's the most characters she's had yet!On the whole, fans will want to have a look at this new chapter in Ayla's life, repetition and all, but try to get it from a public library first."
2984,B000KIT9U4,"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5",,A1B9F8RI3XNWH1,"debeehr ""debeehr""",23/26,2.0,1133049600,"Repetitive, and getting tired of Ayla Sue","First the good news: Auel has always had her strengths as a writer, and these include an *excellent* ear for dialogue, better-than-average characterization skills, deep research, and an ability to take customs and technology that seem exotic and outlandish to modern-day eyes and make them seem familiar. (This probably is related to her aforementioned good skills with characterization--nothing can make the unfamiliar seem familiar faster than seeing ordinary and believable people interacting with it.)Second, the bad news: Auel's drawbacks as a writer are present here as well. Drawbacks include pacing, bad story structure, and clumsiness at integrating her voluminous research with her narrative. She tends to work her research in by doing ""info dumps,"" long paragraphs or pages where she explains every little bit about the natural location and technology level of her people, and these are often long, boring and tedious. She also is not good at understanding what needs to be told, what can be shown, and what should be omitted. What feels like the entire first half of the book is taken up with introducing and re-introducing Ayla to everyone in Jondalar's cave, and often these introductions are spelled out in mind-numbing detail. We needed to see this scene perhaps *once;* future instances could have been rapidly skipped over with ""Ayla and Jondalar made the necessary introductions."" Something similar obtained with showing everyone's reactions to Whinney, Racer and Wolf. Again, one scene of surprise was enough; the rest should have been quickly glossed over.Ayla's ""Mary Sue""-ness is also becoming more and more evident as the book series continues. Over and over (see previous point about repetition) we're told how beautiful Ayla is, how she is the only person who has the knowledge to solve various problems, how she's the most innovative of the group, etc. About the only thing she *can't* do is sing, and I quote from the original ""Mary Sue Litmus Test"": ""Being unable to sing is not a flaw."" After a while, it gets boring and annoying both.But I think the central problem (and this goes back to the repetition thing) is that we've been basically seeing the same scenes for four books now. Ayla comes to a modern human encampment. Wow, gasp, she rides horses and can heal! But oh wait--she has Clan background! By this time, Auel needs to move on and find some new ground to cover with her character, and Ayla's final acceptance of her (Mary Sueish) calling to the ranks of Those Who Serve is a baby-step in the right direction, although more could have been done with this instead of the endless introduction scenes.One of the reasons Clan of the Cave Bear was so good was that it dealt with Ayla in a fundamentally different culture than that of anatomically modern humans, so that we had her as a set of eyes through which to view the culture of Neanderthals. While not all of the research Auel drew on to craft her Clan has stood the test of time, and while some of the stuff she invented was rather unrealistic, at least it was interesting. Her modern human cultures are all so similar to each other that it's difficult to tell them apart; they all share a reverence for the Great Earth Mother, do not know the concept of paternity, and have a relaxed attitude toward sex. So in a way, it feels like I've been reading the same book for the last four of her books. I didn't actually buy this book, and I think I will wait and pick up Earths Children 6 from the library. I'd recommend anyone else reading this series to do the same."

If Jean Auel wanted us to know how much she researched this book, she should publish a book based solely on her research. It was intriguing to hear her description of the Cave of Lascaux; however, I felt myself grow bored, especially with Ayla's seeming perfection. Even the description of the Matrimonial Ceremony was too long. Her first three books were far better and were more action packed. In addition, she kept repeating over and over again how Ayla tamed the animals, ect. I am hoping that the sixth book will be like the first three and that the author is finished with her need to describe in minute detail the flora, fauna, geography, and cultural characteristics of Jondalar's Zelandoni world.

2990,B000KIT9U4,"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5",,,,17/21,4.0,1066262400,I enjoyed this book thoroughly.,"A few thoughts on some of the criticisms others have noted:1) Repetitiousness. Yes, Shelters of Stone hearks back to the other books many times, and even repeats some events (introduction of Wolf, etc.) within this book. That doesn't really bother me. I like touches that make the events of the book minute-by-minute and realistic, including repetition. To me, the interest is in the small differences in what happens each time.2) Ayla's apparent goddesslike status. I disagree. Auel emphasizes at many different places how most of Ayla's insights and inventions are due to her unusual ""niche"" as a solo Cro-Magnon brought up by Clan Neanderthals who must adapt to 1) Clan ways that were adapted for Neanderthal bodies and psyches, 2) Life alone, 3) Life among the Mamutoi and now, 4) Life among the Zelandonii. It isn't that Ayla has some inborn goddesslike quality; Auel even portrays her weird trips into the Spirit World as a result of that root she ate back in the Clan days. It isn't that other people are dumb - they just have generally not been in positions of such extreme necessity to adapt, and have the ways of their tribes to fall back on and their tribes' taboos to forbid thoughts that are too ""outside the box."" Ayla is lucky in that she's perceived as good-looking by the Cro-Magnon peoples-always a bonus, and because she seems to have an inner positive attitude that has helped her adapt to many difficulties. She has also had the luck of having good people around at critial moments, starting with Iza. Anyone remember Aratroa from Plains of Passage? Her twisted life is an example of how a person can come out very differently from Ayla when placed in a cruible without the luck of having loving people around when it counts. Ayla's own discomfort with people's awe of her at many points in the series stems from the fact that she knows she has the abilities she does mostly because of her circumstances. The irony that keeps visiting her is that although she'd love to just fit in, have Jondalar's kids and be happy, her life story has molded her into someone who, like it or not, brings change in her wake, that is, a person of power. Marthona and especially Zelandoni pick up on this and become concerned that Ayla's power be harnessed for the good of the people.3) Lack of plot or character development. Again, I disagree, though there is something to the comments about this being ""buildup"" to the events of the next book. This book is where the events of the next book will have their seeds, I'm sure...and to me, that's plot enough. You have to have an eye for detail to appreciate it. Similarly, given the short amount of time covered in Shelters of Stone, it would be unrealistic to have momentous character shifts. Ayla's main move, aside from gradually becoming used to living with larger numbers of people, is to become more accepting of the disciplined specialness the Zelandonii are pushing on her."

I have never loathed a character so much. She is beautiful, has enormous breasts, is the greatest lay ever but is also the single most brilliant person of the era. Everyone is awed by her. She never makes a single mistake. She invents everything, tames animals, makes tea, heals, performs surgery, educates everyone, hunts like a man, is a perfect warrior and can make a hell of a meal out of SPAM. All while pregnant. Everyone else in the book is pathetically stupid and her boyfriend is a complete himbo - he might as well be in an ad for Calvin Klein underwear. All he does is grin knowingly.There are endless descriptions of the geology and plant-life of the era (like reading an Earth Science book) and this supposed genius research that Ms. Auel accomplished is stuff anyone with half a brain could figure out with no research at all. Plus she basically tells everyone at the beginning of the book that some of it is accurate but MOST is made up - so there! Like it's my book and I'll make pre-history anything I want it to be.Yeah ok. The Earth's Children geniuses have so much more going for them than people did in as recently as the 19th century. So what happened? Everyone was all new-agey and women were equal to men in complete positions of power and then what - 25,000 years later women didn't even have the freaking vote. Ok, sure, makes sense to me.Anyway the rate at which these folks were creating art and items would have had them in computers and Lear jets in record time. So what the hell happened? Everyone got really stupid?The characters are shallow, there is no plot, the book is filled with repetitive introductions, snippets from the other books and feats of amazing wonder that make Ayla out to be the freaking messiah and all of it is written like a guidebook for writers on HOW NOT TO WRITE.You could lose your sanity stumbling over paragraphs with sentences like:That sounded familiar to Ayla. She wasn't sure why. She decided to make some tea. She dug around in her travel pack for some mint. She liked to bring tea to Jondalar in the morning.As well as conversations like the following that go on for entire CHAPTERS:""I know what you are thinking."" she teased Jondalar.""What I am thinking is that with this new spear-thrower that I invented, only after you inspired me, we will be able to hunt much more efficiently and therefore be in less danger from charging bison."" Jondalar grinned.""That is right. Charging bison can be very frightening. Remember what the Mog-ur said?"" Ayla reminded Jondalar.""Yes I remember, but tell me again.""""The Mog-ur said that we should invent a weapon to not be trampled by bison because of his great fear of bison. He was a smart holy man, though I am not sure I know what that word smart or holy actually means,"" Ayla decided to make some tea while they continued to talk.""Then we shall have to invent words for holy and smart Ayla, words like kamakakapoopoo and blerdge.""""I don't like those words Jondalar,"" though she winked at him knowingly, ""Let's just use smart and holy instead, you himbo.""If anyone actually does read this kind of drivel and enjoy it please email me so I can say that I have at least been emailed by the most boring person alive.The fact that this woman has sold millions of books is a sad commentary on how uneducated most people are. I had never read any of the middle books after Clan of the Cave Bear (which I thought was at least mildly entertaining) and I picked this one up because I wanted a good thick beach read.Apparently the woman (Ms. Auel) is utterly senile (thus the repetitions) and can't even remember why she wrote this in the first place. Of course her agent and publisher I am sure gently reminded her - FOR THE FREAKING MONEY.Read this book ONLY if you want to have fantasies of throttling an old senile woman (the author) or if you have no wish to contribute anything useful to the universe on any level."

Even though they all would have the chapters of long descriptions of Pleiostcene life and ecology, they flowed better. The previous books also cover a much longer period of time. I estimated 80%-90% of the book takes place within the first few weeks Jondalar and Ayla return to the Zelandonii! Around a 1/3 of it is the first day back! It then seems Auel realizing how long the book has gotten, quickly moves ahead until its time for Ayla to have her baby. Many scenes were repetitive, Ayla and Jondalar seem to be constantly reminiscing in great detail. Even the expected controversy over her being raised by the Clan seems less dramatic. All but the dregs of Zelandonii society are quick to accept it and believe the Clan is at least worth an acknowledgement of their humanity.

I purchased the hardback, and sat down after making many special preparations as if it would be a religious experience...I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life. Shelters of Stone was slow, dry, and provided me no incentive or motivation to keep me reading on except for a vain hope of it getting better (and perhaps my undying loyalty to one of my all time favourite authors). I am so sad to say it! But when the last page was turned, and the trudging storyline came abruptly to an end, I was left feeling like I worked very, very hard for nothing. I could pick up the next book in the series (yet to be released) without ever having read Shelters of Stone, and would have missed nothing. I am sorry to say it, but I feel as if after ten years of chomping at the bit for the next installment of my favourite series of books, I was sorely let down by a story that felt as if it must been a struggle for the author to write. I love you Jean, but I'm sorry... this book was not at all to your standard. I hope the next one will be better... I'm counting on it, and I'll be first in line to buy it."
