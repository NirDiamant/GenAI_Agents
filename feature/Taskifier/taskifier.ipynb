    "In the world of workforce, procrastination and messy workflow is a common phenomenon, particularly with college students or non-administration level personnel in workplace. This is often due to the lack of clarity in objectives with the tasks given to them. Suppose a SWE in a startup was given a task to build a sign-in page for a web app. Things get messy and discouraging when the SWE was trying to start coding and asked questions like, \"should I build an auth server first or should I create the front end first?\". Those questions can branch off to smaller sub-questions, leaving the task puzzling and therefore driving procrastination. This phenomenon is highly replicable across different industries as well.\n",

Further analysis involving quantitative analysis can be used but given time limitation, we let LLM tackle the analysis of approach and yield the complete plan accordingly. Future improvements can involve behavioral analysis of decision making in quantitative terms, having multiple personas of different work attitudes and approach styles and match the user's preferences to the most similar personas, pivoting from user's feedbacks on generated response and tuning the style preference accordingly, etc."
